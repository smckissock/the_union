    "“The United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government,” it reads, “and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.”\nBy capitalizing on this language, Lake’s plan would establish procedures within this interstate compact that would enable the arrest, detainment, prosecution, and deportation of illegal immigrants, as this plan would see participating states declaring “their territories as under invasion and declare it their sovereign right to secure the borders of the United States.”\nIf Lake is elected and afforded the opportunity to have this plan come to fruition, participating states would likely see their state National Guards fortified and playing a significant role in helping secure the southern border.",
    "But, Lake says that by abdicating from their responsibilities, states are more than authorized “to take matters into their own hands.”\n“Critics have often claimed that the border is a federal responsibility,” she said, “And statute is clear that the federal government is responsible for enforcing security at our nation’s borders.",
    "ARIZONA – Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who became a rising star in the conservative movement in Arizona after spending over two decades in broadcast journalism within the state, recently proposed forming an interstate compact in effort to combat illegal immigration stemming from the southern border.",
    "If Washington refuses to honor its constitutional requirements, states have every recourse and responsibility to take matters into their own hands.”\nAfter reviewing the proposal, National Border Patrol President Brandon Judd cited Lake’s proposal as “one of the best” he’s ever seen, giving it his full endorsement.",
    "In what was a likely reference to the legal drama that unfolded around the 2010 Arizona legislative act that was SB 1070, Lake mentioned how there’s been much discourse over the federal government claiming that illegal immigration and thus border security is their sandbox alone to play in.",
    "According to Lake’s proposal, this interstate compact that would consist of conservative-leaning states would utilize the language outlined in Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution that grants states the right to defend themselves from invasions.",
    "“After thoroughly reviewing Kari Lake’s strategy,” Judd announced, “I fully endorse her bold plan to finish President Trump’s wall and secure Arizona’s border.",
    "The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.",
    "The aggressive policy is one of the best proposals we have ever seen.”\nThis piece was written by Gregory Hoyt on January 18, 2022.",
