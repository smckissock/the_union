    "Though the interview was done a month ago, it recently went viral as it shows Lake walking out of the interview after Liam Bartlett who pressed Lake on whether she agrees with Trump saying all of the rioters from the attack of January 6th, who are currently being held in jail, should be pardoned.",
    "No doubt that Lake was upset with the \"aggressive\" questions, which on their face seem quite basic honestly, such as her unequivocal support for Trump, her questioning the results of the 2020 presidential election, whether or not January 6th rioters should be pardoned, and so on.",
    "Arizona gubernatorial candidate Keri Lake is getting attention for sitting down for an interview with 60 Minutes Australia, but she’s actually getting attention for standing up and walking out of the interview.",
    "Lake is a former local television host who became a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and played a visible role promoting the post-certified “audit” that was largely derided as a farce.",
    "Visit: https://t.co/2OpN9naeZ6 pic.twitter.com/GMu0DGX8TL\n— Kari Lake for AZ Governor (@KariLake) February 12, 2022\nAnd part of what aired last night.",
    "As it went on though Lake began disparaging Australia itself, not just the journalist, but especially their much stronger measures against COVID-19.",
    "Just an embarrassing spectacle, but I suppose not at all a surprising one from Kari Lake who is running to be Governor of Arizona.",
    "Trump-endorsed AZ Gov candidate Kari Lake sat down for interview with ‘60 Minutes Australia,’ which aired tonight.",
    "Things when downhill fast when she was asked if she agreed with Trump that J6 defendants should get pardoned.",
    "Enjoy the end of this wildly biased interview & consider chipping into our Grassroots Campaign!",
    "For her part, Lake already posted part of the interview when it was conducted last month.",
    "(@RonFilipkowski) March 14, 2022\nThe full segment is over 20 minutes long.",
    "Presumably, she thought this part made her look good.",
    "pic.twitter.com/Jmat6BTS1l\n— Ron Filipkowski ????",
    "They're far too comfortable spreading propaganda.",
    "This Hack “Journalist” went into high gear.",
    "WATCH: When the interview ends...",
