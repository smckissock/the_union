    "The thing keeping us right now from being Australia is our Second Amendment and we will never, ever let that go.”\nShe went on to talk about Australia’s COVID “internment camps” calling them “the most horrifying thing I think I’ve ever seen a government do.”\nAustralia put people up at luxury hotels and cabins to quarantine for two weeks after flying into the country in 2020 and 2021.",
    "As for all those “melted guns” so lamented by Lake, Australia tightened its gun laws in 1996 after a lone shooter killed 35 people and injured another 23 at a cafe and tourist site in Port Arthur, Tasmania, using military-style weapons he purchased without background checks.",
    "And rather than doing a story of, ‘Hey, a person who has worked in our industry, had an illustrious career and is running for governor because she cares about this state.’ You're going to do a hit piece or try to be derogatory, which is so typical of where the media goes.",
    "For pointing that out, I’ll, no doubt, join the growing growing ranks of scolded journalists who dared to criticize Kari Lake, or even ask a question that might lead one to conclude that when it comes to matters of substance, this particular Lake is a puddle.",
    "It’s worth pointing out that while pardoning J6 insurrectionists isn’t something an Arizona governor would do, it is fair to ask someone who wants the job if she agrees with the former president whose endorsement she touts at every opportunity.",
    "When 60 Minutes Australia reporter Liam Bartlett recently asked Lake if the Trump supporters who charged the nation’s Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, should be pardoned, her response was to trash not only the reporter but his entire country.",
    "In fact, as any intern journalist can tell you, no one can be held in an American jail for more than a few days unless he or she has been criminally charged, and even then only if the person poses a flight risk or a danger to others.",
    "It’s also worth noting that enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws is also not something an Arizona governor does yet Lake has pledged to finish the border wall and arrest and deport asylum seekers as trespassers.",
    "Do you think they should be pardoned?”\nLake: “I’m still amazed that you’d say ‘Your man, Donald.’ That’s just so disrespectful.”\nThen she launched into your usual spiel attacking not only the media but all of Australia.",
    "As it turns out, so had Lake, who abruptly cut off her interview with Bartlett, saying he made the “crazy reporters and people at CNN look almost respectable.”\nSo did you notice the problem, Arizona?",
    "And you know you guys do that.”\nWhen 12News’ Brahm Resnik asked Lake, during her August mask protest at ASU, what should be done about a surging pandemic, her response was to trash the reporter.",
    "When CBS 5/3TV's Dennis Welch in June asked Kari Lake about her donations to then-presidential candidates John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008, her response was to trash the reporter.",
    "That it is absolutely the job of journalists to ask tough — and frankly, in this case, not even tough — questions that will help voters get a feel for the candidates who beg to lead them.",
    "“I noticed that you did not say the Pledge of Allegiance and that’s really despicable,” she said, though she didn't explain how she noticed such a thing when he was wearing a mask.",
    "Lake didn’t even seem to know that the J6 defendants, as they are called, all have been charged with crimes associated with their storming of the U.S. Capitol.",
    "We have something called the U.S. Constitution and we have rights.”\nBartlett: \"So we’d be better off having more guns here?”\nLake: “Yeah you would.",
    "Perhaps in Australia because you’ve given your rights away, you melted down all your guns and you guys have no freedom, that you find that OK.",
    "The country banned all semi-automatic rifles and all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns and now requires a license to possess a gun.",
    "Then she bought ad time on the Sunday Square Off show he hosts over the weekend, trashing not just Resnik but all reporters.",
    "OPINION: Kari Lake's response to questions she can't (or doesn't want to) answer is to trash the reporter asking it.",
    "Cue the detonation: “What I don’t like is that people are being held in prisons without being charged,” Lake said.",
    "Instead, she noted that J6 pardons aren’t an issue for the governor and … wait for it … attacked the reporter.",
    "\"The media isn't just corrupt, they are anti-American,\" she proclaims on her ad before launching into Resnik.",
    "If there's a story with a conservative in it, it always has a negative slant and people are onto it, Dennis.",
    "Let’s just briefly revisit Lake’s disaster of a Down Under interview, which aired on Sunday evening.",
    "You are trying to twist this interview as trying to make me look bad.”\nNo twisting needed.",

    "It’s worth noting that Australia has had no mass shootings since 1996.",

    "“What I see is happening here is I'm running for governor.",
    "I feel so sorry right now for the people in Australia.",
    "It’s plays great, after all, with the Republican base.",
    "Maybe they did away with that stuff in Australia.",
    "But here in America, we do things differently.",
    "“I have no say in that,” she told Bartlett.",
    "‘Your man Donald’?”\nBartlett: “Well he is.",
    "Lake never answered Bartlett’s question.",
    "This isn’t something a governor does.",
    "You know what's also worth noting?",
    "I mean he endorsed you personally.",
    "The Australians had had enough.",
    "Are you catching on, Arizona?",
    "They should all be pardoned.",
    "With democracy, not so much.",
