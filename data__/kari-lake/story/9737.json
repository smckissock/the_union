    "Jeremy Carl, a Senior Fellow at The Claremont Institute, remarked on Twitter that, “In case you want to know how far gone America is, we just took an NCAA championship away from Olympic individual silver medalist Emma Weyant, a true exemplar of feminine athleticism, and awarded it to someone with a pe**s who was competing as a men’s swimmer last year.”\nEmma Weyant’s competitive swimming career snagged her a spot on the 2020 Olympic Swimming Team.",
    "In fact, former Education Department press secretary, Angela Morabito, commented on Twitter, “Second is the new first.”\nFor reference, Lia Thomas, born Will Thomas, formerly competed on the University of Pennsylvania’s men’s swimming team, where he ranked as #462 as a male, according to the Washington Examiner’s Restoring America.",
    "Regardless of what the mainstream media and progressive leftists say, science itself says that Thomas’ DNA and physical makeup will always remain male, giving him a biological advantage over the women athletes who have trained their entire lives to compete in the NCAA championships.",
    "Unsurprisingly, one member of the University of Pennsylvania’s swimming team has said that several female members are uncomfortable changing clothes in the locker room when Thomas is present, according to a report from the New York Post.",
    "While the controversy surrounding the event rages on, one thing is certain: Emma Weyant dominated the swimming competition on Thursday, and she deserves to be celebrated for her epic accomplishment in the water.",
    "The Washington Examiner reported that over 300 Olympians and Olympic coaches signed a petition demanding that women’s sports be protected from the unfairness of transgender participation in these events.",
    "When he switched to the women’s team, he suddenly rose to the top spot, breaking records and dominating the 500-yard freestyle, beating out hardworking female athletes like Emma Weyant.",
    "Many women are rightfully angry about this, as men who identify as “female” are beginning to infiltrate women’s locker rooms and physically compete in their sporting events.",
    "This has drawn the ire of countless Americans, who are pointing out that the inclusion of men in women’s sports is an erasure of the biological dignity of the female body.",
    "In light of this, many people wonder why incredible feminine athletes like Emma Weyant, the rightful champion of the 500-meter freestyle, are not being protected.",
    "On Thursday, Emma came in second to Lia Thomas, a biological male turned transgender athlete, who was allowed to compete in the women’s championship.",
    "As it stands right now, Lia Thomas has eradicated competition in female sports by competing against them as a biological male.",
    "Emma Weyant from the University of Virginia is the real victor of the NCAA Women’s Swimming Championship 500-yard freestyle.",
    "On Thursday, Weyant’s time for the 500-yard freestyle clocked in at 4:34:99, which should have earned her a gold medal.",
    "There, she netted a silver medal for the women’s 400-meter in the 2020 Summer Olympics held in 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.",
    "Emma would have come in first place had Lia Thomas not been allowed to participate in the women’s sport.",
    "The question, of course, is how far people will allow the inclusion of transgender athletes to go.",
    "How does inserting a man into a women’s competition elevate women or defend their rights?",
    "What will it take to protect women from the intrusion of men in their private spaces?",
    "Why are biological women suddenly being forced to compete with men?"
