    "Republican Rep. Shawnna Bolick of Phoenix said her proposed law, added as a last minute “strike everything” amendment in the House Ways and Means Committee she chairs, would give some small relief to renters who have seen metro Phoenix rents soar from 15% to 30% — depending on size and location — in the past year.",

    "She said cities should “learn to live within their means.”\nThe $152 million in city tax revenue is collected by individual cities, ranging from about $60 million in Phoenix last year to $1,900 collected by the small Navajo County town of Taylor.",
    "“And I respectfully think that 2% of that $330 that we're talking about, overnight at the snap of a finger, the relief that we're talking about is minute.”\nBut Bolick said cutting city taxes is better than nothing.",

    "Prescott falls right in the middle, with the city of about 45,000 people 100 miles (140 kilometers) north of Phoenix, collecting $2.6 million in rental taxes.",
    "With police and fire taking up a majority of the city budget and cuts there unpalatable, that means all other services would need to be cut by more than 25%.",
    "And the bill as written does not require that money to go back to the tenant, although Bolick vowed to add a provision requiring that if necessary.",
    "“There really is no other option.”\n“Both of those options impact those same renters that this bill purports to help,” Savage said in an interview.",
