    "On Saturday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Cross Connection,” Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) argued that we have to move off of fossil fuels so we’re “free of the ability of dictators to blackmail us over oil and gas,” and that increasing domestic oil production wouldn’t keep gas prices from increasing because “no matter what we do, prices of gas are going to go up.”Jayapal said, “[I]f we ever want to be truly free of the ability of dictators to blackmail us over oil and gas, we should be investing right here at home in renewable energy technologies.",
    "We should be weaning ourselves off fossil fuels"
