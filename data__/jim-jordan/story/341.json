    "After failing to plan for the obvious contingenies, a doddering Joe Biden turned up late to his own press conference and announced that he's volunteering America for higher energy prices as a result of his feeble bid to defend Ukraine's borders.",
    "He sounded like George W. Bush, that same George whose dad annoyingly warned Ukraine about its 'suicidal nationalism' back in 1989 in what came to be called his 'Chicken Kiev' speech.",
    "Not by anyone normal's measurement: \"Defending freedom will have cost for us as well, and here at home,\" Biden said.",

    "Neither\nComments:\nWhere's his cutoff of Russian oil?",
    "\"We need to be honest about that.\"",
    "He's suddenly all in for freedom?",
    "America first?",
    "Freedom?"
