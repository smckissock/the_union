    "BENSON: Right, the Russian savagery here could very well make it more difficult domestically for Zelenskyy to sell some sort of peace deal down the line if that involves any meaningful concession to Russia when it comes to territory, because Ukrainians, I think, quite rightly would say hold on, look at what we have done.",
    "But what they really need if they are going to hold that eastern territory and push Russia out is a lot heavier fire power, and that is the decision that is facing the Biden administration, and it ought to be the correct and appropriate reaction to what we saw over the weekend.",
    "With that, let's bring in our panel, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio, Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters.",
    "I think this, in some ways, yes, increases revulsion of the world, vis-a- vis the Kremlin and Putin, but could create some issues for Zelenskyy with his own people if he is trying to find an offramp or some sort of a deal that would be palatable to his people.",
    "And we care because, look, all the way back at the time these emails came out there was already a former Hunter Biden associate who claimed that Joe Biden was involved with some of these deals, or at least one, \"10 for the big guy,\" that famous email.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBAIER: Jeff, do you think these appeals and the fact that the president is now calling these atrocities war crimes, and has, and Putin a war criminal, will change the actions that the Biden administration is taking in any way?",
    "But in terms of additional military equipment and additional material that can help Ukraine, yes, I think every day, including the atrocities that we have learned about today, puts pressure on the Biden administration to do more.",
    "The reason we are seeing these horrifying images out of Bucha and elsewhere is Russia is retrenching to the east and it's increasingly targeting the Ukraine military infrastructure, which is why they are begging for these things.",
    "SEN. RON JOHNSON, (R-WI): I do know I don't trust the Justice Department, and I think really what \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" articles prove is how complicit they have been and continue to be in the cover-up.",
    "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nREP. JIM JORDAN, (R-OH) HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE RANKING MEMBER: We're launching an investigation because the real thing here was how Facebook and Twitter suppressed this information.",
    "They confirm, among other things, Hunter's business deal with the CEFC China Energy conglomerate, a company closely linked to the Beijing government which paid him and Joe's brother James almost $5 million.",
    "It says \"He must also figure out what, if any, sort of political agreement with Moscow to end the war will be acceptable to a Ukrainian population riding high after repelling Russian forces in many areas.",
    "So the spin has changed undoubtedly, and I think a lot of the people who are trying to poo-poo it again have very little credibility based on their last set of talking points that no longer apply.",
    "STRASSEL: Yes, I think the issue here isn't necessarily one pandemic related policy, but the fact that there is no real effective policy at the border, and that people are simply pouring across.",
    "JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"REUTERS\": Well, Bret, I don't think it will change their policy or position that the U.S. and NATO will not go fight with boots on the ground in Ukraine.",
    "Meantime, \"The New York Post\" which broke that story before the election \"The Washington Post,\" \"New York Times\" finally admit Hunter's laptop is real, but only to protect Joe Biden some more.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I cannot talk with someone sitting in front of me with nuclear weapons, and I'm sitting with submachine gun.",
    "Compromises may also be more difficult after evidence mounted Sunday of Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians following the retreat from the Kyiv region, sparking public revulsion.\"",
    "Almost six weeks into the war between Russia and Ukraine I'm beginning to wonder if this conflict isn't our first true world war, much more than World War I or World War II ever was.",
    "But I think it's safe to assume it's a headache, and it's not a headache that they are dying to have to deal with right now, as several months from now turn into midterm elections.",
    "And, in fact, the White House said today that there will be more aid coming to Ukraine and there will be more sanctions, U.S. sanctions, announced against Russia later this week.",
    "SEN. MARK WARNER, (D-VA) SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIR: I would be very reluctant for the administration to end this Trump policy until they had a real plan in place.",
    "We care because of the potential national security implications given his tie up with all of these different countries and the fact that his father is in the White House.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMARK BRNOVICH, (R) ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL: We know that their attempt to rescind Title 42 will lead to drastic consequences on our southern border.",
    "So it's sort of a sick farce, that organization, to begin with, and Russia's continued place on that body, on that panel, I think, just underscores what a joke it is.",
    "Look, we are now three weeks into this discussion about whether or not Ukraine gets the MiGs that it wants, whether it gets the air defense system that it wants.",
    "Because we now know, according to \"The Post,\" according to \"The New York Times,\" something we knew a year-and-a-half ago, that this stuff was as real as it gets.",
    "I did see that the Biden administration announced today that they are going to push at the United Nations for Russia to be removed from the Human Rights Council.",
    "Virtually everyone on the planet can either observe the fighting at a granular, participate in some way, or be affected economically no matter where they live.\"",
    "VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is happening in the Europe of the 21st century, so this is the torture of the whole nation.",
    "And, again, this gets to the question of whether or not Joe Biden was dishonest with the nation when he said he knew nothing about his son's business dealings.",
    "But even if Russia somehow did get thrown off, that commission or that council would still include China, Libya, Sudan, Cuba, Venezuela, the list goes on.",
    "LIZ TRUSS, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: We have seen butchery, evidence of rape and sexual violence, as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians.",
    "BAIER: All right, let's turn to the topic of Title 42 and concerns about this COVID related asylum being wiped away on the border at the end of May.",
    "We heard Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, over the weekend saying that the president has confidence that his son did not break the law.",
    "There was an account in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" just a written account that came out today that will make your blood run cold if you read it.",
    "And when they are asked at the briefing, then the spokesperson, either Jen Psaki or last week Kate Bedingfield, refer to Hunter Biden's lawyers.",
    "Going back to what I was saying before, this is something that you will certainly hear Republicans continue to criticize the White House about.",
    "Guy, does this, the latest images, and obviously we have seen the series of horrible images out of Ukraine, but do they change the dynamic now?",
    "President Zelenskyy, meantime, making the calls again around the world, talking to media, including here on SPECIAL REPORT on Friday.",
    "The White House, of course, making clear, I believe it was today, that this was a CDC decision based on where we are in the pandemic.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nROBERTA METSOLA, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT: These are war crimes that are perpetrated by war criminals.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBAIER: President Biden calling it war crimes on the ground in Ukraine as these atrocities come to light.",
    "And the world feels like maybe we've lost the ability to be shocked over these last few weeks, but this has gotten worse.",
    "Up next, the increasing pressure on the president now that the mainstream media is covering the Hunter Biden scandal.",
    "Biden has been very open about saying of course Zelenskyy is asking for all of these things, and understandably so.",
    "Kimberley, there is this line, this the president is out of this completely, even as this investigation continues.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBAIER: Republicans in the House and the Senate talking about the Hunter Biden investigation.",
    "We talk with the Biden administration, and they allocate us this or that weaponry, and we want heavy weapons.",
    "GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: I think a little bit just because of how horrific they truly are.",
    "Until the administration deals with that underlying problem, this is just one more issue related to it.",
    "In \"The New York Times\" Thomas Freidman writing \"Putin had no clue how many of us would be watching.",
    "We can continue to send a lot of the stuff that we have been sending so far, Stingers, for instance.",
    "Plus, the controversy over those COVID related rules for the border and what that means big picture.",
    "BENSON: We have this entire crew saying it was all Russian disinformation before the last election.",
    "I think we are a generous country, but we have to have -- we have to be a country of rule of law.",
    "\"The Washington Post\" admits that much, but vehemently denies Joe was involved in such dealings.\"",
    "To this day the press is not grilling the White House on the accuracy or veracity of that email.",
    "What would befall those people who would then be sucked into Russia behind that new curtain?",
    "Would they be subject to these types of attacks and killings of civilians and other torture?",
    "It would take a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly to boot Russia off of that body.",
    "NED PRICE, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: These atrocities are not the act of a rogue soldier.",
    "And right now it's essentially on fire, and this would be like throwing gasoline on a fire.",
    "That could have happened, these calls, at least, could have happened weeks and weeks ago.",
    "This is unbelievable corruption at the highest levels of government and within our media.",
    "This is the difficulty about getting to that negotiating table and what that looks like.",
    "You mentioned Ron Klain saying the president is confident his son didn't break the law.",
    "Russia is a member of the Human Rights Council to this day in good standing right now.",
    "And if we gave them a few inches of our territory, what would happen to Ukrainians?",
    "But I would be very worried about this notion that the border would be overwhelmed.",
    "It very well could involve the president based on what Kimberley just referenced.",
    "But he is not going to go so far as to say the U.S. is going to go into Ukraine.",
    "Look at what they have done, killing civilians, raping women, bombing children.",
    "KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, let's hope that they do more.",
    "JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No, I think it is a war crime.",
    "The announcement from the CDC Friday, and it's happening at the end of May.",
    "MASON: I think it is tough in large part because they won't talk about it.",
    "And it not only an issue for the border, it's an issue for the election.",
    "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sir, are you going to do more sanctions on Russia?",
    "And now the talking points are very differential at the White House.",
    "Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.",
    "We are waiting for those because they said that they will help us.",
    "BAIER: Jeff, how -- is it tough to estimate the level of concern?",
    "STRASSEL: Yes, the press continues utterly to fail to do its job.",
    "But it has ramifications far beyond that for the political world.",
    "BAIER: Here is \"The Washington Post\" on Zelenskyy's issue, Guy.",
    "This is a rush transcript from \"Special Report,\" April 4, 2022.",
    "And the pictures that accompany these stories are shocking.",
    "This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.",
    "There has been a lot of pressure in Washington to do so.",
    "And he said that, oh, it's a private matter anyway.",
    "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you agree it's genocide?",
    "They are part of a broader, troubling campaign.",
    "Where is the White House and the reaction here?",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBAIER: Jeff, it's happenings.",
    "BAIER: All right, panel, thank you very much.",
    "He's another misbehaving son of a politician.",
    "BAIER: I think Iran is on that panel as well.",
    "So weather it's a game changer, I don't know.",
    "Look, why are we talking about Hunter Biden?",
    "Well, apparently the DOJ isn't as confident.",
    "It's not because we care about him himself.",
    "Take a listen to another clip from Friday.",
    "And Democrats are concerned about it, too.",
    "BIDEN: I am seeking more sanctions, yes.",
    "We have had the upper hand militarily.",
    "Why on earth do we give them an inch?",
    "And it doesn't involve the president.",
    "BAIER: Panel, stand by if you would.",
    "This is weakness at the beginning.",
    "There is no question about that.",
    "That's a probe that's ongoing.",
    "It is gutting, gutting stuff.",
    "They are finally doing it.",
    "We're back with the panel.",
    "BAIER: Quickly, Kimberley?",
    "Who were they talking to?",
    "This is serious business.",
    "So they plan to do more.",
    "It's quite astonishing.",
    "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",
    "We don't know that.",
    "What did they know?",
    "BAIER: Kimberley?",
    "That's not right.",
    "Guy, thoughts?",
    "Take a listen.",
    "MASON: Indeed.",
