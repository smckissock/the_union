    "And now that Trump himself has said he may pardon everyone charged with January 6–related crimes, it was clear that McDaniel saw her job as aiding Trump in that project: If it’s the official party line that the insurrection was legitimate, then there’s nothing outrageous about pardons.",
    "There’s so much more that could be said, but the money quote in this episode is the line in the resolution that condemns Cheney and Kinzinger for “participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.” This is right out of 1984.",

    "I had to laugh at the part of the resolution that denounced Joe Biden for his alleged pursuit of “socialism.” The Biden administration has seen the creation of seven million private-sector jobs.",
    "Then along came Newt Gingrich, the key figure who intensified the culture war, and in time the conservative movement swallowed the party whole—and moved hard to the right while doing it.",
    "As near as I can tell, it looks like two RNC members have gone on the record saying they shouted “no”: Bill Palatucci of New Jersey and Henry Barbour of Mississippi.",
    "But in the last 50 years, the ideological sorting out of the parties took hold—over race, women’s rights and abortion, immigration, religion, and kindred issues.",
    "In addition, the resolution was accompanied by the passage of a change to Rule 11, which stipulates that the party can’t take sides in a competitive GOP primary.",
    "Honestly, it hasn’t been for a quite some time, but with last week’s resolution condemning Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the party made it official.",

    "The Democrats had better remember how the Republicans blurred that distinction once Jim Jordan becomes chairman of the Judiciary Committee.",
    "And the select committee on January 6 is not exactly investigating Republicans across the country who are, say, protesting mask mandates.",
    "McDaniel and the rest will deny it, but it’s true; and in fact the more vociferously they deny it, the more they’re merely confirming it.",
    "It’s important to know a bit of this history in order to appreciate just how dangerous and out of step with American history this GOP is.",

    "The Republicans were Wall Street and country club conservatives combined with agrarian populists and New England liberals.",
    "What makes the statement, passed by the Republican National Committee at its winter meeting in Salt Lake City, so special?",
    "Now we’re one step closer, for example, to the party mounting its own armed militia in time for the 2024 elections.",
    "It was passed by voice vote, without debate or discussion; the decision was made in about one minute’s time.",
