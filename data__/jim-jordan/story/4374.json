    "On his Monday-night broadcast, host Dan Ball declared that “One America News Network is now at war with AT&T, and it is time that we all fight and fight like hell with our words and our pocketbooks.” He claimed that AT&T chairman William Kennard has had “connections to the Obamas and the Clintons for decades,” and encouraged viewers to pile on.",
    "“Why give money to people who hate us?” Paul’s outraged missive was in response to the news that DirecTV, a subsidiary of media conglomerate AT&T, would drop far-right and ardently-Trump-supporting One America News Network (OANN) from its lineup—news that caused right-wing politicians and media figures to dissolve into paroxysms of outrage.",
    "Bring it, and we’ll air it.” Ball also urged viewers to call DirecTV’s customer support line on an hourly basis to “complain,” “raise hell,” and “demand they keep OAN.”\nDonald Trump himself took on the controversy over the weekend, singing the network’s praises at his rally in Arizona.",
    "Maybe what we should do is not use AT&T.”\nIt was OANN’s obsession with Trump that helped make its name—the network was relatively unknown before its hosts began pushing Trump’s election conspiracy theories—but the same fixation has caused the network no shortage of problems.",
    "— Melania Trump’s 2022 Resolution: Grift Like There’s No Tomorrow\n— Elizabeth Holmes’s Guilty Verdict Won’t Change Silicon Valley\n— TV Star Sarah Wynter’s Battle With Postpartum Psychosis\n— From the Archive: Inside the Chaotic Final Days of Theranos\n— Not a subscriber?",
    "— The Life and Death of Rosanne Boyland, a Capitol Rioter\n— Ghislaine Maxwell’s Guilty Verdict Comes Into Question\n— Kimberly Guilfoyle’s Leaked Texts Aren’t Doing the Trumps Any Favors\n— Why Did Team Biden Reject a Proposal for “Free Rapid Tests for the Holidays”?",
    "“A vague ‘routine internal review’ and the lack of transparency…in your decision making process is unacceptable and has the appearance of targeting supporters of former President Donald Trump.”\nUnsurprisingly, the sharpest critique has come from the network itself.",
    "“You bring me concrete evidence of whatever it may be: cheating on his taxes, cheating on his wife, saying racial slurs towards white people.” (The latter was presumably a reference to Kennard being Black.)",
    "Representative Jim Jordan described it as the latest phase in “The Left’s purge,” while Representative Lauren Boebert suggested the Joe Biden may have had a hand in DirecTV’s decision.",
    "“There has not been sufficient justification from DirecTV as to why OAN’s contract was not renewed by your company,” Daines wrote in the letter, which was obtained by the Daily Caller.",
    "When its contract with DirecTV ends in April, it will likely lose a huge chunk of its viewership—unless the likes of Rand Paul and Steve Daines can turn things around.",
    "“Pretty convenient that this comes within a week after Biden begged companies to silence ‘misinformation,’ meaning his opposition,” tweeted the Colorado Republican.",
    "OANN is also still fighting two defamation lawsuits from voting-equipment companies that its hosts accused of tampering in the 2020 election.",
    "DirecTV attests that it made the decision “following a routine internal review.” But OANN’s defenders see its axing as an overt hit job.",
    "It’s a disgrace what’s going on.” He went on to suggest a boycott: “I don’t think that people are gonna stand for it.",
    "On Wednesday, Senator Steve Daines sent a letter to DirecTV CEO Bill Morrow urging the provider to change course.",
    "“If you’ve got any dirt on Mr. Kennard, I’d love to see it and put it on this program,” he said.",
    "Join Vanity Fair to receive full access to VF.com and the complete online archive now.",
    "And they want to cancel them now because of politics—for purely political reasons.",
    "“@DirecTV is cancelling @OANN so I just cancelled my home Direct TV,” he tweeted.",
    "“I watch it all the time and you really get the truth.",
    "It looks like we're experiencing playback issues.",
    "On Monday, Senator Rand Paul did something bold.",
    "“I love One America News,” he told the crowd.",
    "He continued: “Whatever it may be.",
    "Find it for me.",
    "Our bad!"
