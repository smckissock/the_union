    "Meadows participated, as a functionary of the Trump campaign, in activities intended to result in actions by state officials and legislatures to change the certified results of the election,” the committee wrote in its filing, pointing to Trump’s now-famous call in which the former president asked the Georgia Secretary of State to “find” more votes.",
    "“They felt that he had the authority to — pardon me if my phrasing isn’t correct on this, but — send votes back to the States or the electors back to the States, more along the lines of the Eastman theory,” Hutchinson said, referring to John Eastman, who crafted two memos for the Trump campaign outlining how to challenge the election.",
    "Mr. Meadows is hiding behind broad claims of executive privilege even though much of the information we’re seeking couldn’t possibly be covered by privilege and courts have rejected similar claims because the committee’s interest in getting to the truth is so compelling,” committee Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.)",
    "“I don’t recall anybody speaking out and definitively expressing disagreement with that theory,” she said of the lawmakers, adding that “the vice president’s team appeared slightly skeptical.”\nWhile Meadows has passed along 2,319 of his text messages to the committee, he has withheld 1,000.",

    "While Meadows was slated to appear before the committee’s investigators on Dec. 8, he informed them Dec. 7 he would no longer be coming, instead filing a lawsuit challenging its subpoena for his testimony.",
    "The committee also says testimony with numerous White House staff indicates Meadows continued with efforts to keep Trump in power despite indications from White House counsel that such plans were illegal.",
    "The document states that Meadows was involved in these efforts at both the state and national level — plans he continued with despite receiving intelligence there could be violence on Jan. 6.",
