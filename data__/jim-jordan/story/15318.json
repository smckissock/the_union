    "3515 Elida Road\nLima, OH 45807\nA big, fat thorn to The Lima News for its Feb. 27, less than Holy Sunday morning “thorning” of those folks calling for enforcement of constitutional law as written in the 14th Amendment, which specifically and pointedly prohibits “a member of Congress” from holding office after engaging in “insurrection or rebellion” or “giving aid or comfort to enemies thereof.”\nThat is present law!",
    "Like it or not, whether neighbors, friends, promoters of your pet interests or pleasing the prejudices of your corporate bosses, those who violate it are “outlaws” and criminals and, if not placed behind bars, should play no part in governing this nation.",
    "This newspaper’s editorial staff is showing a cowardly, abject disdain for the American system of justice when it encourages placing Jim Jordan above the law, thus promoting a corruption of our system of government — to put it kindly.",
    "Letters must have a signature (unless emailed) and a full name, address and daytime telephone number (for verification purposes only).",
    "Letters dealing with private disputes or containing criticism of private individuals or businesses are not published.",
    "During periods of high volume, such as prior to an election, writers can be limited to one letter a month.",
    "To excuse criminal behavior is to advocate for criminal behavior as is, in this case, The Lima News.",
    "They should be concise, to the point and original — no form letters, please.",
    "Letters are subject to editing for length, clarity and grammar.",
    "We welcome letters of 275 words or fewer.",
    "Letters may be published on our website.",
    "Lyle Henry\nBluffton\nPrevious\nNext"
