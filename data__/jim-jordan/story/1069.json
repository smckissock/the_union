    "Whatever Durham hopes to use to sustain the claim of a continuing conspiracy, this filing seems to concede that the lies Durham claims Sussmann told in that meeting that took place five years and a few days ago will not be charged.",
    "However, Jordan retweeted a Fox News article which did include the entirety of the former president’s comments — making it unlikely he wasn’t aware of the Trump’s suggestion the operatives should be put to death.",
    "As Marcy Wheeler rightly points out:\nAs he did with Igor Danchenko, John Durham has raised a potential conflict as a way to air his conspiracy theories so he can jack up the frothy right.",
    "https://t.co/4vAJ6GBmKG\n— emptywheel (@emptywheel) February 13, 2022\nAs usual, the former guy had a tantrum, and demanded that Clinton operatives should be put to death!",
    "Fox News, of course, never mentions Jordan's involvement in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, because they want to paint him as a credible critic of the Democrats.",
    "If you haven't seen the latest wingnut outrage by the Daily Mail and the Washington Examiner, just read Empty Wheel's post on Durham's latest troll.",
    "And, again, Kash Patel has known about this for four years, and did nothing while he was among the most powerful men in govt.",
    "Jordan is himself a primetime player in the attempted coup of January 6, who still refuses to cooperate in the investigation.",
    "The right wing echo chamber explodes with manufactured outrage, as John Durham finally gives the Trumpers something.",
    "But they will run with it, even though it is from five years ago, because it has Clinton's name on it.",
    "Rep. Jim Jordan amplified Trump's dangerous threats with a retweet, which Mediaite noticed.",
    "Whether he knows what he retweeted or not, Jordan needs to testify about Jan. 6.",
    "And guess who is leading the pack promoting this new Durham/Clinton conspiracy?",
    "Isn't the penalty for trying to overthrow a duly elected U.S. government death?",
    "No proof required, just hyperbolic outrage.",
    "If he doesn't, he belongs in jail.",
    "It's not proof, only conjecture.",
    "He's a fraud and a traitor.",
    "Kash Patel."
