    "Letter from Bennie Thompson to Mark Meadows’ attorney concludes:\n“The Select Committee is left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution” pic.twitter.com/ahiwtgTaub\n— Alayna Treene (@alaynatreene) December 8, 2021\nCould the double standard be anymore obvious?",
    "In a letter released Monday, Illinois Republican Rep. Rodney Davis, the ranking minority member of the House Administration Committee, questioned Pelosi in regards to her repeated refusal to cooperate over the past year with requests for information from House officers who answer directly to the Speaker’s office.",
    "“There is irony in the fact that at the same time House Democrats are holding witnesses in criminal contempt of Congress for raising genuine questions of legal privilege, you continue to obstruct Republican access to House records relating to the security preparedness of the Capitol complex,” Davis wrote.",
    "In the letter, Davis specifically asks Pelosi what decisions she made with the House Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, what Pelosi did that day, and why House officers she controls are withholding information that Republicans are seeking.",
    "(TeaParty.org Exclusive) – The one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 so-called “insurrection” is upon us and there is little doubt that the Democrats and their mainstream media sycophants are gearing up to commemorate the ordeal as if it were the bombing of Pearl Harbor.",
    "Last month, the full House voted mostly along party lines to recommend a criminal contempt investigation by the Department of Justice into former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows for criminal contempt for halting his cooperation with the committee.",
    "While Nancy Pelosi is still “investigating” the matter with her partisan sham committee, Republicans took a jab at her this week, accusing her of deliberately suppressing any information in regards to her own role in the events of that fateful day.",
    "pic.twitter.com/6zVW0lE0Ni\n— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) January 3, 2022\nMeanwhile, Trump supporters who refuse to comply with the requests of Pelosi’s little committee get indicted and held in contempt of court.",
    "Republicans are making it pretty clear that Pelosi is far from off the hook and with the Democrats’ power in the House on thin ice as the midterms approach, she should be getting pretty nervous right about now.",
    "“If you are truly interested in working with Republicans to improve the Capitol security posture, I demand that you direct all House officers immediately to stop obstructing our oversight,” Davis wrote.",
    "No consequences for Pelosi as she remains silent on her own involvement in the Jan. 6 events but for anyone with an R behind their name, it’s indictments and criminal contempt investigations.",
    "If Davis’ letter means anything, it means there’s coming a reckoning and Democrats have about 10 months to decide how to play it when it comes but make no mistake, it’s coming.",
    "While Pelosi and her fellow partisan hacks pretend to care about the security of the US, it is, ironically, also them who have posed the greatest threat to it.",
    "Democrats are determined to make Jan. 6 the single biggest tragedy to ever happen in the US, bigger than 9/11 and bigger than Pearl Harbor.",
    "Along with that, they want to carry out criminal action against their political opponents in a fashion this country has never seen.",
    "It’s been obvious since day 1 that the sole purpose of Pelosi’s committee is to smear President Trump and demonize his supporters.",
    "As a matter of fact, we doubt very much that security is even one of the reasons behind the sham committee and its investigation.",
    "Of course, we all know Pelosi is not “truly interested” in working with Republicans nor is she “truly interested” in security.",
    "Anyone who dares refuse to cooperate with the sham committee will face political persecution to the fullest extent.",
    "Steve Bannon, for example, has been indicted by a federal grand jury for defying subpoenas from the committee.",
    "This entire charade is about political persecution and it should concern and outrage every single American.",
    "Thanks to Republicans, however, we just may be getting another view into the Jan. 6 events.",
    "She is free to withhold whatever information she so chooses.",
    "New letter from @RodneyDavis and @HouseAdmnGOP.",
    "Except, Pelosi herself, of course.",
