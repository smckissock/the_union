    "Former Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes told Newsmax that Special Counsel John Durham's findings regarding Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign — her camp is said to have paid an internet company to infiltrate servers at Trump Tower and the White House — may very well yield \"many, many, more\" indictments.",
    "Appearing on \"Eric Bolling: The Balance,\" Nunes, who now heads Trump Media & Technology Group, says a key question remains to be answered:\"What did she know, and when did she know it?\"",
    "\"Yep, there was spying going on,\" Jordan said, \"and it was worse than we thought because they were spying on the sitting ?president of the United States.",
    "According to the New York Post, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, speaking on Durham's investigation, found credibility in the probe's assertion of spying.",
    "He's already indicted one of the Clinton's lawyers — others seem to be in trouble; high-level DNC lawyers seemed to be in trouble.",
    "Remember, we made 14 criminal referrals [to the Department of Justice]; that doesn't mean just 14 people.",
    "My assessment is it looks like there's going to be many, many more, but we just don't know yet.\"",
    "So it'll all be dependent at the end of the day, what did she know, and when did she know it?",
    "Note: See Newsmax TV now carried in more than 100 million U.S. homes, on DirecTV Ch.",
    "\"And it also is going to depend on what indictments Durham continues to bring.",
    "\"Durham is going to have to run a perfect investigation here, Nunes continued.",
    "\"So he [Durham] has to go through and look at all of that.",
    "\"He's got to wrap up all the people that were involved.",
    "And it goes right to the Clinton campaign.",
    "That's really what it comes down to.",
