    "Throw in a few writers from libertarian Reason Magazine and a few more libertarians from the Cato Institute, along with a veritable smorgasbord of other speakers best known to their family and friends, and you have what Republican attorney Heath Mayo — founder of Principles First for America, which is hosting the summit — says will “certainly be counter-programming of CPAC.”\n“We want to come together in a visual show of support for people who have taken stands for ideas when it hasn’t been comfortable,” Mayo told CBS News.",
    "Despite raising an infinitesimal amount of money, this challenge was taken seriously enough by the media that they started taking Joe Walsh’s prior statements seriously — including, according to Axios, claims that Barack Obama was a Muslim and “traitor.”\nHe spent a decent chunk of the campaign apologizing for his past — telling BuzzFeed News that he wasn’t a racist, “but certainly I’ve said some racist things” — got almost no support and pulled out after receiving less than 1.1 percent of the vote against Trump in Iowa.",
    "He now maintains a Twitter feed in which he tells people about what music he’s listening to (he’s basic enough that he considers “Dream On” by Aerosmith “too damn cool”), his farm life and, of course, how the GOP is a vile hive of treacheries all connected to Trump:\nIf you want to discuss “Conspiracy LLC” — which I’m also guessing has some part in that big ol’ “substantive discussion” about the conservative movement — Mr. Riggleman will be there.",
    "We’re not talking satire here: Principles First is not only a real thing, it’s being held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.\nIts most prominent speakers are GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois — the only two Republican members invited to participate in the Democrat-run Jan. 6 committee in the House of Representatives by Nancy Pelosi.",
    "On the plus side, though, if you’re the kind of conventioneer who misses dressing up as Han Solo for ComicCon but you’re too old for that kind of ridiculousness, Principles First will let you discreetly play-act as a real conservative for a weekend at an event where a bunch of anti-Trump hand-wringers parrot Democrat talking points.",
    "“We look forward to bringing together conservative and independent speakers, thought leaders, and grassroots activists for two days of panels, speeches, networking, and substantive discussion about the meaning of conservatism today and the future of our movement,” the description reads.",
    "We’ve been chronicling the damage both of them have done by adding a patina of legitimacy to the Democrats’\nOn Principles First’s website, it describes the Feb. 26-27 convention in Washington as being “focused on discussing and advancing a more principled politics in the United States.",
    "In withdrawing, he said the GOP was “not a party, it’s a cult.”\nSo yeah, if you want to engage in a “substantive discussion about the meaning of conservatism today and the future of our movement” involving that guy, Principles First has you covered.",
    "There’s also Alexander Vindman, the former National Security Council official, whose whistleblower report on then-President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky led to Trump’s first impeachment.",
    "Scroll down, however, and the first event partner you see is The Bulwark — the grift-tastic RINO outlet founded by two of the NeverTrump movement’s chief establishment architects, Bill Kristol and Charlie Sykes.",
    "In addition to Cheney and Kinzinger, we also have an appearance from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose fight with Trump over certifying the vote in Georgia drew national attention.",
    "According to The Hill, Principles First is intended as a kind of RINO counter-programming for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, with both set to take place this weekend.",
    "There are “Star Trek” conventions where people dress as Spock, comic book conventions where you could see Spiderman or Wonder Woman, or anime conventions where the costume of choice is Sailor Moon.",
    "Marsha Blackburn of Tennesse, Mike Braun of Indiana, Ted Cruz of Texas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Rick Scott of Florida.",
    "We’ll see how many folks show up.”\nThose people might be attending a convention where there are more set to speak than there are in the audience.",
    "Minor-league former office-holders who’ve found varying degrees of post-electoral fame by railing against Trump, however, will also be speaking.",
    "You also have Reps. Lauren Boebert and Ken Buck of Colorado, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, Ronny Jackson of Texas and Jim Jordan of Ohio.",
    "So, no, the Principles First “counterprogramming” doesn’t look like it’s all that appealing unless you’re one of the people on the rostrum.",
    "Then decided he didn’t like Donald Trump, so he mounted a quixotic run against the sitting president in the 2020 Republican primaries.",
    "CPAC is in Orlando, Florida this year, so perhaps Principles First will get a few stragglers who can’t make it to the Sunshine State.",
    "Ron DeSantis will be there, along with radio hosts Mark Levin and Glenn Beck, and Ultimate Fighting Championship legend Tito Ortiz.",
    "In that vein, we bring you Principles First, a convention where rabid NeverTrumpers play dress-up as actual conservatives.",
    "There’s Joe Walsh, the former Illinois Republican who served one term in the House of Representatives.",
    "There’s no shortage of conventions where attendees put on costumes and pretend to be someone else.",
    "Tom Nichols, the emphatic-airquotes “conservative” in residence at The Atlantic, is featured.",
    "Bring a few Aerosmith tapes and a boombox and I’m sure he’ll sit down to jam with you.",
    "We also have Denver Riggleman — who, despite the name, was a House rep from Virginia.",
    "After his cup of coffee in office, he became a controversial conservative radio host.",
    "So is Capitol Police Office Harry Dunn, who testified before the Jan. 6 committee.",
    "“You don’t see those folks, yet, in rooms that are energized.",
    "He also served one term in Congress from 2019 to 2021.",
    "However, the lineup at CPAC includes Sens.",
    "Oh, and then there’s Donald Trump himself.",
    "Geoff Duncan will also make an appearance.",
    "Those are the only sitting politicians.",
    "But I think the energy is there.",
    "(Both are featured speakers.)",
    "Sure beats CPAC, right?",
