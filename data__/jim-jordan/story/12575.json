    "This is the president, Joe Biden, whose Administration called parents domestic terrorists if they dare go to a school board meeting and challenge these idiots that we're keeping their kids out of school, doing long term damage to kids; go on against the science that said kid should be in school because he wanted to bow to the teachers' unions, and he changed the CDC guidance even because the teachers union said they wanted it rewritten.",
    "INGRAHAM: Craig, is a part of this also because -- and I know you've written about this so eloquently and beautifully, the lack of civic education, the love of our founders, our history, even with all the difficulty, even with all the heartbreak, even with all the -- you know, the sin of slavery, that we're really not teaching our kids to love the country in school in so many ways.",
    "HEMINGWAY: Well, I do think there is this problem that was referenced earlier of the Democrat base, keeping politicians from being able to move away from some of the policies that are so politically toxic, that, that AOC wouldn't be happy, even with the paltry thing that Biden suggested about like having a little bit more fossil fuels available is, is not a good thing.",

    "INGRAHAM: You get the sense, Congressman Jordan, that the spinmeisters out there, and some of the other, other networks really believe that Biden's problem is a messaging problem, that if he comes out and delivers a speech without a huge number of gaffes that somehow everything's going to turn around, and front and center was CNNs Van Jones, watch.",
    "And the importance -- the importance, like for instance, State of the Union address is that it's important because certain -- sometimes good policies come out of it like Monroe in his seventh State of the Union address announced the now, you know, the Monroe Doctrine, which has become so important and so famous today.",
    "Congressman Scalise, it sounds like you know, they want to keep that, you know, card in their back pocket to be able to drop down on masks, again are closing for the next variant because the first shutdowns worked out so well for the country, or maybe just before the midterm elections and have mail-in voting.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Mollie, how many times have you come on the INGRAHAM ANGLE over the past two years, when Biden and his minions and the press have been vilifying Ron DeSantis, Kristi Noem, you pick your Republican Governor Abbott for endangering the lives of kids and putting science in the backseat.",
    "Congressman Jordan, this speech was kind of a thematic train wreck starting with the heartbreak and the horror in Ukraine, and then an attempt to kind of reframe everything they've done over the past 13 months as a, almost a populist adventure in addressing middle Americans concerns, your response tonight.",
    "There are text messages that the Ukrainian had been Ukrainian government have been releasing between soldiers and their families back home saying we thought we were going to be welcomed when we arrived and now, we've been told to shell cities.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Mollie, they were trying to sweep all AOC and confident under the rug tonight, but they're still driving a lot of the policy, especially on energy, but she tried to pretend she was really disappointed in the speech.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): It definitely was a lost opportunity, because the entire country does support, there is profound bipartisan support to a long shirt, a long, a long-term shift away from fossil fuels.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways, but he badly miscalculated.",
    "You know, in 1941, after Pearl Harbor, the Republican National Committee, the Democratic National Committee actually got together and promised not to conduct partisan elections after that, that we were completely unified as a country.",
    "And but Biden, look, he has to recover, that, that the perception that he's a strong leader, and also that he's competent, because those are two of the things, the intangible things that he's really lost ground on over the past year.",
    "This is a guy who's currently leading efforts to kick people out of the military, if they don't, if they don't receive the vaccine, even if they've made religious exemptions or appealed for some, some way to continue their service.",
    "It is these policies that are unpopular, it's not Biden, it's not the way he messages things, it's the actual policies that are causing so much trouble for the economy, for our national security, for our sovereignty as a nation.",
    "INGRAHAM: Well, and Tom, I think, to Mark's point, Ron Klain made a decision that they had to go with Ukraine tonight, that had to start the speech, and they had to really spend the most energy and emotion I think, on Ukraine.",

    "We were unified during the Korean War, we were unified in the -- at least in the early days of the Vietnam War, something like in '68, something like 60 -- 55 percent of the American people supported the war in Vietnam.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Congressman Jordan, I mean, there was the insulin, there was the water, there was the broadband Internet, I thought this was an Obama speech from like 2000 -- you know, 2009, at one point.",
    "Now to help us understand why, let's bring in presidential historian Craig Shirley, who's been watching all these developments unfolding, both with the State of the Union and the developments, of course, in Ukraine.",
    "I said in a committee hearing a few months ago, Democrat member Roe Khanna with the CEOs of all the major oil and gas companies, badgered every single witness and said, will you pledge today to decrease production?",
    "INGRAHAM: Well, Congressman Jordan, the other issue that of course, when he started with talking about Ukraine -- we'll go to Scalise on this, when he started talking about Ukraine, he had to give the impression.",
    "He talked about inflation, and then he talked about raising taxes to 50 percent on companies, which by the way, means we're all going to pay more at the grocery store, at the shopping center if we go buy things.",
    "I cannot reach out because they're constantly sitting in basements of their apartments and in shelters, trying to hide because there are a lot of alarms and serins informing people about the possible airstrikes.",
    "But first, in a desperate attempt to reset the narrative of what is obviously a failing administration, Joe Biden tonight, delivered and address that sounded more like the state of the European Union at times.",
    "And if you listen, he kept trying to sell Build Back Better, the failed, even Democrats said enough of the crazy spending, he was trying to sell this idea of spending trillions more dollars and raising taxes.",
    "That's because the Polish authorities as well as those in Romania and Moldova, other bordering countries are waving women and children through now doing everything they can to ameliorate the refugee crisis.",
    "Keep in mind, Laura, this is the same president who said right when Afghanistan was about to fall that Afghanistan wasn't going to fall -- in within 48 hours, the Taliban had control of the entire country.",
    "But as he called for unity, I kept thinking he's been demonizing police, separating people by race, and I'm wearing this in Jimmy and ducal, which I got his grand marshal of a parade here in New Orleans.",
    "The fact is that we're, we're also learning that many of the soldiers who came into Ukraine, the Russian soldiers, felt that they were coming as peacekeepers so they would be welcomed by the Ukrainians.",
    "I have to say that that number has dwindled a little bit over the last 24 hours, certainly when we came in the backup on the Ukrainian side of the border was probably a couple of miles of vehicles.",
    "Imagine how different things would be today if Ukraine had those surface to air missiles, all the carpet bombing you're seeing cluster bombs, bombing of schools and daycare centers and hospitals.",
    "So, people aren't going to forget that he thinks maybe just by saying all of these things tonight, people forget what he did the last year, they're not going to forget because he keeps doing it.",
    "But to your point, it was a risky bet to lead with that, particularly when everyone knows that inflation in the economy is the number one issue in the minds of American has been for a long time.",
    "However, when it comes to that 40-mile long, armored convoy that we have been talking about, the one that had been bearing down on Kyiv, it has actually made no advances over the last 24 hours.",
    "And if you don't bring energy prices down, then I don't see how you're going to go into an election without the economy being a serious negative issue against the president and the Democrats.",

    "INGRAHAM: Max, we're learning that the city of Kherson in the south has fallen to Russian forces tonight, reports just moments ago that Belarus has doubled its troop numbers on the border.",
    "And as you know, if you're in, and people think that about the economy, that is the most devastating possible thing that you have to reverse, or at least seem to be on the side of people.",
    "Tom, the message from Biden tonight seems to -- seem to be kind of like, we're not changing a thing, but the issue for Biden is that Americans don't like any of what they've done so far.",
    "And unless the administration can really improve their standing on the issue of the economy and on inflation in particular, and on other issues, like immigration and crime and education.",
    "They're just not -- they have to go seek it themselves, either on the internet or the talking to somebody or reading books or something, but they're not being taught in American history.",

    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBIDEN: But I want you to know we're going to be OK. We're going to be OK. Putin's war in Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.",
    "So, that, that in and of itself is much harder to control for Biden than for instance, really affecting gas prices if he dealt with the energy situation the way he should, correct?",
    "INGRAHAM: Benjamin, how concerned are your sources that the more of these photos which we've seen in the New York Times tonight, of presumably they look like Russian soldiers dead?",
    "And as you watch the syntax slip, it communicated weakness, unsteadiness, and frankly, that's why we're seeing our enemies emboldened and the media's constant reportage of Ukraine.",
    "And the problem is with Putin in charge of his forces still, at this point, and determined to press those forces in and around Ukraine that nobody knows where this will end, Laura.",

    "INGRAHAM: Well, and Mark, the inflation issue, as we've seen, whether it's Bloomberg's reporting or the Wall Street Journal, this is -- or Goldman Sachs, this is not going away.",
    "Having lost their lives in this invasion, how that image broadcast around the world will further infuriate Putin into some mad act against innocents on the ground in Ukraine?",
    "And if he finds himself backed into a corner, he's going to do what we've seen him do over the last day or two and that brings out the heavy artillery and hits the people.",
    "The U.N. now saying that 677,000 people have left in the past six days, that number rising by about 100,000 today at the moment, again, no one knows what today will bring.",

    "INGRAHAM: But there's also a point, I think, Congressman Scalise, that when you listen closely to Biden, I don't think they're quite willing to let COVID go completely.",
    "We spent months building coalitions of other freedom loving nations in Europe, and the Americas tip, for America to the Asian and African continents to confront Putin.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Congressman, I'm hearing him talk about environmental justice in the same paragraph, as he's talking about taking on President Xi of China?",
    "So what is the sense from the Ukrainians that you're talking to about where this may be headed because the Russian forces seem to be slowly but surely surrounding?",
    "And Biden went into tonight's State of the Union address with an approval rating that's nearly 14 points underwater, according to the Real Clear Politics average.",
    "And even if he wanted to do the right thing, as Mollie said, even if you wanted to reset even if you want to do the right energy policy, his party won't let him.",
    "He did a very good job of humanizing the manufacturing, talking about this pacific, pacific place, it's going to be in the number of jobs and that kind of stuff.",
    "All these bad things happen as a result of Biden policies, our energy situation is bad, because Biden on day one decided to keep our energy from being produced.",
    "I think he felt like he had to, that the administration was anticipating all that was coming, that the size of the convoys or the, the what Putin had in mind.",
    "We can take that leverage away by opening up American energy, raiding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would then run out we would have no reserve left.",
    "I want to get Mollie to this electric vehicle reference that Biden maid tonight, when he was talking about ways to lower the price of fuel for Middle America.",

    "Well, this time she was a spasmodic backup dancer popping up in clapping, making bizarre faces, readjusting her orthodonture but this moment took the cake.",
    "That's a big risky bet, given we don't know what's going to happen tonight, tomorrow night, if Putin is going to stay there -- if I mean, we have no idea.",
    "You said he didn't have many gaffes, but it was actually hard as a listener to listen to him struggling so much to just start ticking eight basic words.",
    "MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON STRATEGIST: Yes, that is not a good post-State of the Union poll, especially since those samples tend to be highly democratic.",
    "But if you look at what happened in Ukraine, a month ago, the Ukraine Government was asking America for help with surface to air missiles, for example.",
    "So it certainly the Cold War, there was bipartisanship support for anti- communism, that, especially in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, it started coming apart.",
    "And historically, Americans have rallied around presidents in times of international crisis, but that doesn't seem to be quite the case for Joe Biden.",
    "They like to pretend that some of their people are moderate, like Joe Biden, they like to pretend that he is versus some of these more extreme people.",
    "And I, I think the President has a problem going out and giving the remarks he gave, if the Ukraine falls, he will again seem to have totally failed.",
    "He has Ukrainian blood running through his veins and yet he's helping oversee what is the brutal you know, take down -- attempt the takedown of Kyiv.",
    "We need to be together and find those moments of joy together as a people and get through the difficulty with some common sense and some patriotism.",
    "Jonathan, you just came across the Lviv border yesterday, so what's the situation like there in terms of the refugees we're hearing 670,000 so far?",
    "No one knows what will happen next but we can already say that it's a bloody mess that is happening here and a bloody mess also for Russian troops.",
    "I mean, yes, it may well infuriate Putin, though he's never shown any signs in the past about being concerned about the safety of his own soldiers.",
    "You will lower gas prices at the pump, and you'll take billions of dollars out of Putin's pocket, so it can't use it against the people to Ukraine.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Mark, that was like they all lost their best friend on that panel when that was revealed and those polls, do you agree?",
    "INGRAHAM: Craig, I wish we had more time tonight, but you gave us a good grounding and what we need to do and what we need to know going forward.",
    "The problem with getting bogged down here in the Russian death toll rising was that eventually they felt his own people might turn against him.",
    "PENN: Well, you had during the Trump years, almost about 70 percent, saying that the economy was doing great and going in the right direction.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Well, Biden wants you to believe that this is kind of like \"Rocky 4\" and he sliced alone and Putin's Yvonne Drago.",

    "Joining me now Tom Bevin, Co-Founder and President of Real Clear Politics; and Mark Penn, Former Clinton Strategist and Democratic Pollster.",
    "Because I've looked at some of those snap polls we're going to get to in a second, why do you think he's going to get any bump from this?",
    "I mean, again, the populist rhetoric aside, they are sticking with the green-iac agenda come hell or high water, end of story, full stop.",
    "He tried a little bit to address food prices, but he blamed big corporations for that he wasn't again really credible and more detailed.",
    "INGRAHAM: Raymond, what did you make -- what did you make, Raymond as we begin the Lenten season about Biden's calls for unity tonight?",
    "ARROYO: This address -- this address was notable or for the reappearance of that State of the Union performance artist, Nancy Pelosi.",
    "And within moments from tonight's State of the Union, you might have missed, plus, all the predictable media adulation that followed.",
    "At times he looked lost, he was squinting, it was more like the stare of the Union, he kept looking off trying to figure things out.",
    "INGRAHAM: Max, the defense minister Shoygu in Russia, his mother is actually Ukrainian born which I didn't realize until last night.",
    "I was just at the Reagan Library on my book tour, my new book, and it's astonishing, the level of ignorance on the part of so many.",
    "They would be able, the people of Ukraine would be able to stop those planes and helicopters from coming in, but Joe Biden said no.",
    "And instead, it was like he gave a speech for a different country where things are sort of OK, and where the last year hasn't seen.",
    "But tonight, I say that we never will just accept living with COVID-19, we'll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases.",
    "And those energy, just decisions that he made over the last year have contributed to this terrible situation unfolding in Ukraine.",
    "Now, he wants a kumbaya moment after he destroyed kids' education or his party did for the better part of a year, year and a half?",
    "And this is one of those few times that he could actually articulate a knowledge of how bad things are addressing actual problems.",
    "Congressman Jordan, at the same time, Biden, I think is, is trying -- he's seeing what's happening with public opinion in China.",
    "Well, you fast forward, you go to what happened just in the last year, the Joe Biden didn't give him the arms that they needed.",
    "I mean, so it made -- so much we made no sense to me and I think that was probably the reaction of most of the American people.",
    "Because in Biden's world, the plutocrats always end up running the show, regardless of all the phony appeals to Middle America.",
    "Tonight, we are hearing some alarming reports from Ukraine at this hour as morning breaks on day seven of the Russian invasion.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nINGRAHAM: Well, Congressman, he's been finding that, of course, China continues to fund what Russia is doing.",

    "BEVIN: Yes, and look, the other problem that Biden has, there was a Suffolk USA Today poll that came out earlier this week.",
    "And a U.S. official now saying in fact that it has been beset by logistical problems, supply issues short on fuel and food.",
    "And when it comes to addressing key issues enough, 69 percent said Biden adequately addressed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
    "After defunding the police had been a major Democrat initiative for years and particularly for, again, that hard left base.",
    "And I think we've, we've seen this as a policy problem, big policy problem, both on domestic, frankly, and foreign policy.",
    "And I think the poll really suggests that on the core issues where he's having problems, not a message, but a performance.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN): The most biggest moment for me was just the way he brought people together.",
    "And my guess is that number is higher after his speech tonight, and I think it changes coming that this midterm election.",

    "And by the way, Putin is making $700 million a day, every day that he's selling oil to the United States and Europe.",
