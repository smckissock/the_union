    "He has an obligation to come forward and we’ll get to the truth.”\nAt her weekly news conference, Pelosi said McCarthy “has an obligation, as we seek the truth, to help with that.”\nSchiff, who used to be friendly with McCarthy, did not mince words: “By his own admission, Kevin McCarthy is a key witness to the events of January 6 and Trump’s response to the violence,” he said by email Friday.",
    "On Thursday, CNN’s Don Lemon described “the duality of Kevin McCarthy — that’s a kind way of putting it.”\nAnd now, because McCarthy is desperately trying to stay on Trump’s right side and become House speaker, McCarthy is threatening to retaliate against House Democrats for pursuing the crucial Jan. 6 investigation, for doing their jobs.",
    "The defendants, according to the Justice Department, organized into “teams that were prepared and willing to use force and to transport firearms and ammunition into Washington, D.C.”\nThe indictment quoted many of the Oath Keepers’ internal communications, many about weapons being stashed just outside Washington.",
    "On Thursday, the Justice Department announced that 11 people, including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, had been arrested and charged with “seditious conspiracy” in connection with the plot to invade the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying President Biden’s victory.",
    "Both have refused the committee’s invitation to testify, speciously claiming they have no relevant information to share — as if it’s up to them to make that judgment — that the investigation is an exercise in Democratic partisanship and serves no legitimate legislative purpose.",
    "But no one would have known any of that had happened, had we not fought.”\nThe refusal of McCarthy and Jordan to cooperate puts committee members in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether to issue subpoenas to their own colleagues.",
    "Now that Devin Nunes has slunk off to the Trump-a-verse, is there anyone in Washington who is as transparently cynical, cowardly and dishonest as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the Republican shape-shifter from Central California?",
    "And from the very beginning, Trump and McCarthy have vigorously opposed any effort at accountability.”\nThankfully, the truth about Jan. 6 is already emerging in ways that are beyond the control of Trump lackeys like McCarthy and Jordan.",
    "According to the federal grand jury indictment, the Oath Keepers, a right-wing militia group that recruited former and current military and law enforcement personnel, conspired to violently thwart the peaceful transfer of power.",
    "If Republicans do retake the House in November and McCarthy ascends to the top post, he said last week that he would strip Democratic Reps. Adam B. Schiff, Eric Swalwell and Ilhan Omar of their committee assignments.",
    "That can’t be avoided.”\nThere is no question now, a year later, that anti-democratic conspirators armed to the teeth were prepared to do violence to overturn the results of a fair and fraud-free election.",
    "“Nevertheless, it should come as no surprise that McCarthy is refusing to cooperate with the Select Committee’s investigation, because McCarthy always puts Donald Trump’s interests ahead of the country.",
    "Because Democrats stripped two far-right conspiracy-addled GOP representatives, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona, of their committee assignments for truly despicable behavior.",
    "Two Republicans joined Democrats in November in censuring Gosar for promulgating a video depicting him murdering Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) by plunging a sword into her neck.",
    "It wasn’t just Democrats who were repulsed; 11 Republicans joined House Democrats in February to punish Greene for, among other things, supporting violent threats against Democrats.",
    "Otherwise, he has made himself into a confederate of the insurrectionists and fools who, as Biden so memorably put it, held a dagger to the throat of our democracy that day.",
    "Contrary to sweeping Republican efforts to downplay the attempted coup, this was not a spontaneous act by dupes who let Trump goad them into criminal behavior.",
    "A man who said he was willing to testify before an investigative committee about his conversations with Trump on that terrible day … before he decided not to.",
    "Recall that McCarthy infamously admitted on national television that they were nothing more than political theater designed to dirty up Hillary Clinton.",
    "In response, Pelosi invited onto the committee two Republicans who have not been cowed by Trump, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.",
    "Jordan beclowned himself every time he opened his mouth during the House Intelligence Committee’s hearings on the first Trump impeachment.",
    "And, of course, in July, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to seat two of McCarthy’s five picks for the House Jan. 6 committee.",
    "Nominating them in the first place was simply further proof of McCarthy’s bad faith, fealty to Trump and obstructionism.",
    "Here is a man who blamed then-President Trump for inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection … before changing his mind.",
    "But more important, Jordan has no business on the committee because he is a material witness to the events of Jan. 6.",
    "“I wish that he were a brave and honorable man,” Cheney said ruefully of McCarthy last week in an interview with CNN.",
    "A man who was for a bipartisan investigation of the horrible events of that day … before he was against it.",
    "She accepted three Republicans and nixed two, the unbearable Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana.",
    "McCarthy needs to tell Americans what he knew, when he knew it and exactly what Trump told him on Jan. 6.",
    "Pelosi, by the way, was not just within her rights as speaker to refuse to seat Jordan and Banks.",
    "Jordan and Banks have both demonstrated zero interest in sussing out the truth about Jan. 6.",
    "He withdrew from the process entirely and refused to appoint any of his members.",
    "“Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?” he told Sean Hannity.",
    "McCarthy, it should be noted, then picked up his marbles and went home.",
    "“But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee.",
    "Contrast that to the House Republicans’ Benghazi hearings spectacle.",
    "The fact that they failed does not make the attempt any less grave.",
    "“It will be a bloody and desperate fight,” wrote Rhodes in one.",
    "For his performance, Trump awarded him the Medal of Freedom.",
    "Both were vocal critics of the committee’s very existence.",
    "Because he would rather retaliate than legislate.",
    "“He’s clearly trying to cover up what happened.",
    "And so, for that matter, is McCarthy.",
    "“We are going to have a fight.",
    "She essentially had no choice.",
    "What are her numbers today?",
    "Because she’s untrustable.",
    "Her numbers are dropping.",
    "Why?",
    "Why?"
