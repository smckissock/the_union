    "“We’re going to find out.”\nIn a letter, Republicans plan to tell House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that their party is reaching another crossroads where they “must once again decide whether they will vote to fund a federal government that is enforcing tyrannical COVID-19 vaccine mandates on the American people.”\nSignatories to Roy’s letter include Paul Gosar, Lauren Boebert, and several other usual suspects.",
    "Instead, he wants to force Republicans into tough votes, starting with articles of impeachment against President Biden and a full congressional inquiry into the 2020 presidential election, which he says was stolen from Trump.",
    "Former Army Green Beret Joe Kent is running for a U.S. House seat in Washington state held by another Republican, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, who voted to impeach Trump over his role in the events of Jan. 6 at the Capitol.",
    "One way to do that is to force go-nowhere issues like a shutdown aimed at defunding vaccine mandates, knowing that MAGA candidates will embrace that position wholeheartedly while more moderate Republicans will equivocate.",
    "Forcing a highly unpopular government shutdown to protect a popular vaccine rule would be one of the dumber political plays the GOP has made over the past five years, especially with an election less than a year away.",
    "“Most Republicans say that vax mandates are tyrannical and foolish, but will they unite before government funding expires on Feb. 18 to pledge not to fund enforcement of these mandates?” [Chip] Roy asked.",
    "Last month WaPo noticed that populists like Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene are hoping to boost their numbers this fall, giving them more influence over the new House majority next year.",
    "If you’re McConnell or Kevin McCarthy, your strategy from now until November is to play a “prevent” defense, avoiding any mistakes that would let the other team quickly put points on the board.",
    "A shutdown engineered by your fringiest members would be the opposite of that, signaling to voters that they can’t trust Republicans to govern responsibly if they hand power to them.",
    "How excited do you think noted vaccine proponent Mitch McConnell will be to have a big intra-party fight about defunding the government over an issue that’s polling this way?",
    "MAGA types in the House and Senate considered forcing a shutdown to block federal vaccine mandates in December, the last time we had a standoff over government funding.",
    "Finally, the MAGA caucus always enjoys making McCarthy and McConnell squirm by reminding them that they can galvanize populist opinion against the leadership at will.",
    "But other vaccine mandates persist, like the one for federal workers and the one for staff at health-care facilities that receive money from Medicare and Medicaid.",
    "It’s put up or shut up.”\nI support the effort to shut down government funding to stop the tyrannical vaccine mandates, Kent will inevitably say this summer.",
    "There’s no political cost to broadcasting your opposition to mandates in a draconian way when you know your party won’t let those draconian tactics prevail.",
    "Most of the members who end up signing on to Roy’s letter won’t need the extra brownie points with MAGA and anti-vax voters but Roy himself might.",
    "If Trump endorses, I will run, and we will kick Chip Roy’s ass.” That opponent, Matt McCall, lost by just five points in their previous contest.",
    "If McCarthy sides with Roy and the rest in their futile bid to force a shutdown, they’ve demonstrated their leverage over him once again.",
    "This may also be a ploy by the MAGA caucus more broadly to engineer a new litmus test for Republican candidates in House primaries.",
    "Remember that he refused to object to certifying Biden’s victory on January 6, 2021, putting him in the minority of his own caucus.",
    "“Will at least 10 of the 19 GOP senators who voted to punt last time now stand up for health care workers or not?” he continued.",
    "Last summer, Roy’s 2018 primary opponent told National Review, “I have asked Trump for his endorsement to run against Chip Roy.",
    "If McCarthy breaks with them, they have a new argument against him next year when it comes time to choose the new Speaker.",
    "Why, Jim Jordan surely would have fought for a shutdown if he were in charge of the caucus, the MAGAs will say.",
    "“I need to be going after the people in the Republican Party who want to go back to go-along-to-get-along.",
    "The issue had more traction then because Biden’s OSHA mandate for large employers was still a live issue.",
    "First, it’s a chance for MAGA types in Congress to signal their populist virtue on the cheap.",
    "If you’re Roy, there’s never a bad time to shore up your right flank with gesture politics.",
    "And maybe Trump will back them up and decide Jordan would make a better leader after all.",
    "Kent said he has little interest in fighting with Democrats if he makes it to Congress.",
    "So MAGA Republicans still have a target if they want to pursue their shutdown gambit.",
    "Fast-forward six weeks and that’s no longer the case thanks to the Supreme Court.",
    "This is dumb but interesting when you consider who it’s designed to hurt.",
    "In fact, just a few hours ago OSHA formally withdrew the mandate.",
    "It won’t even try to reformulate it in hopes of passing muster.",
    "McCarthy bought the ticket, now he can enjoy the ride.",
    "“A lot of it will be shaming Republicans,” Kent said.",
    "The federal mandate for private businesses is dead.",
    "Trump noticed that and hasn’t forgotten.",
    "Which could be dangerous in a primary.",
    "The Court upheld that mandate, 5-4.",
    "So what’s this really about?",
    "He understands all that.",
    "Why didn’t my opponent?",
    "I’m guessing they will.",
    "Three things, I think.",
    "But Roy’s not stupid.",
    "Hint: Not Joe Biden.",
    "Oh well."
