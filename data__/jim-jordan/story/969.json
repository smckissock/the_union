    "Waukesha parade massacre suspect Darrell Brooks has pled “not guilty” to killing six people and wounding dozens of others when he allegedly plowed an SUV through crowds of Christmas parade attendees in November of last year.",
    "Brooks’ attorney also requested for a change of venue or for jurors to be sequestered and selected from another county, arguing that the intensity of the parade coverage has already turned the city of Waukesha against him.",
    "“We’d waive formal reading, and we can enter pleas of not guilty this morning,” Brooks’ defense attorney Jeremy Perri said last Friday.",
    "Comments:\nPrediction: The trial of this scum will be almost entirely ignored by the mainstream media.",
    "Yup, I'm going out on a limb on this one."
