    "regardless of how many corporate leaders are increasingly pursuing progressive policy goals that are not aligned with their shareholders,” these duties still exist.”\nAccordingly, in order to comply with the Congressional investigation into Big Tech, the letter makes “a formal request” that all accounts of Musk’s offer, as well as the board’s deliberation and response to it, be diligently preserved.",
    "“Big Tech is waging a war on free expression online.” It’s a common refrain among critics of Twitter’s “heavy-handed, anti-discrimination policies”: “to silence important voices, and to crush ideas that are contrary to the dominant progressive consensus.”\nElon Musk is trying to buy the social media company in order to get rid of the company’s biased political filtering.",
    "This letter serves as a formal request that you preserve all records and materials relating to Musk’s offer to purchase Twitter, including Twitter’s consideration and response to this offer, and the evaluation of Twitter’s shareholder interests with respect to Musk’s offer,” the Republican-led document continued.",
    "All documents, communications, and other information, including electronic data and metadata, that are or may be relevant to this congressional inquiry should be interpreted as an instruction to take all reasonable precautions to prevent their destruction or modification, whether intentionally or negligently.",
    "House Republicans led by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan (R) wrote a letter to Twitter’s board of directors on Friday asking that they get ready to submit information regarding their activities aimed at preventing billionaire Elon Musk from purchasing the social media site.",
    "‘[The Board’s] reactions to Elon Musk’s attempt to buy Twitter, and outer opposition to Musk’s role in Twitter’s future are alarming,’ says the letter.” The Board of Directors of Twitter has a duty of care to the company’s stockholders.",
    "As the letter states, the Twitter board’s ideological and political opposition to Musk’s buyout bid appears to conflict with the board’s fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of shareholders.",
    "Text messages, phone-based messaging apps, and encryption software are all included in this directive.",
    "It applies to all electronic messages delivered through official or personal accounts or devices."
