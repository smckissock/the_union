    "It will be dismissed before it ever gets to discovery, and the lawyers who filed this piece of shit — the infamous Alina Habba, and some personal injury lawyer in Florida who happens to have been Trump's boarding school roommate in 1964 — will be lucky to get out of this without getting sanctioned.",
