    "Earlier this month, Jordan sent a letter to the House select committee signaling that he would not cooperate after he was asked to provide information.",
    "\"His contempt for the truth has been on display ever since he denied knowledge of the sex abuse his wrestlers endured during his tenure at Ohio State.\"",
