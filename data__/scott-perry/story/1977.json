    "In 2012, Congress passed the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act), the lawmakers wrote, which they said was an attempt to \"prevent members of Congress from using congressional knowledge to their advantage in stock trading.\"",

    "\"I just think the American people are kind of tired of the games up here on both sides of the aisle, and they just want to see us do our job, come up here as committed public servants and not get rich day trading,\" Roy said.",
    "But under the STOCK Act, which was passed in 2012, members of Congress and their families are forbidden to profit from inside information, and lawmakers are also required to report stock trades to Congress within 45 days.",

    "The lawmakers were referring to investments made by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., and then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., after a coronavirus briefing.",

    "Pelosi has faced criticism from both sides of the aisle for saying members of Congress and their spouses should be allowed to trade stock as part of a \"free market economy.\"",
    "\"I've said to the House Administration Committee, review all the bills that are coming in and see which ones — where the support is in our caucus,\" Pelosi said last week.",
    "The trades were reviewed in 2020 after concerns that they used inside information to benefit their stock portfolios, and that they could have violated the STOCK Act.",
    "And yet people are buying and selling stocks or buying and selling Pfizer while we’re in the middle of the pandemic, like, how is that OK?\"",
    "Psaki was asked whether the president believes members of Congress and their spouses should be prohibited from trading stocks.",
    "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\"The president didn’t trade individual stocks when he was a senator,\" Psaki said.",
