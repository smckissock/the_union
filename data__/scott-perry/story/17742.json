    "More Needed from POTUS to Thwart Red Menace\nAfter nearly 40 years of uniformed service, myriad deployments – including Bosnia and Iraq - and the privilege of being a Member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, I say with confidence that it’s no coincidence that within four short months of President Biden’s catastrophic and deadly exit from Afghanistan, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin was busy ratcheting up war with Ukraine.",
    "Biden enjoyed a very long tenure in the Senate, leading the Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, but it shouldn’t take Senate experience or advice from Ivy League PhDs to understand what most of us learned on an elementary school playground: present clear, consistent, and convincing consequences to bullies and, no matter what, follow through.",
    "For Putin, however, international politics is a zero-sum game; Ukraine’s westward positioning undermines Putin’s own autocratic rule in Russia, and an independent Ukraine is a direct threat to his ability to extort the world and his desired regional hegemony.",
    "The best way to avoid a land war in Europe is to show Putin that America is committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty, and that we have the tools, partnership, and resolve to help - without committing American lives or bankrupting our Treasury to do it.",
    "Just so there’s no mistake for those who smear and twist narratives to suit their political ends, I’ve said this over and over, and it isn’t hard to understand: Putin is a thug, a murderer, and a tyrant — for starters.",
    "Where Americans saw President Biden’s catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan as humiliating - and a painful reminder of the importance of a competent execution strategy - Putin saw endless opportunity, and took it.",
    "The world is a safer place when America is firmly resolved to remain “the shining city on a hill.”\nU.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a Republican, represents Pa.'s 10th District, which includes parts of York County.",
    "Ukraine earned its independence and sovereignty, and now has the right to defend itself against foreign invasions, even if President Biden can’t be bothered to defend our own Nation from daily invasion.",
    "Despite Biden’s dismal failure though, there’s still time to right this ship, and for the U.S. to show the world how strength and resolve is the best option for the situation at Ukraine’s borders.",
    "It’s a good first step that the US has been able to work with our EU partners and implement a partial ban on certain Russian banks using the SWIFT system, but that doesn’t go far enough.",
    "Winston Churchill emphasized the importance of diplomacy as a means for avoiding war, and President Reagan mastered it with his peace through strength doctrine with the Soviet Union.",
    "Consequences of Biden’s negligent withdrawal are far-reaching, and forever marked with painful images of fallen Marines and desperate Afghanis plummeting from the sky.",
    "With self-preservation in mind, Ukraine requested anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, and we should sell those to them and NATO to repel Russian invaders.",
    "But if Germany won’t, there are two other steps President Biden must undo with regard to his feckless initial volley, and show Putin that we‘re serious.",
    "Arguably, President Biden waiving Nord Stream 2 gave Putin a clean extension of the New START treaty, emboldened him to take the steps he’s taken today.",
    "Americans are united in our opposition of another “forever war,” and our desire to avoid sending our best and bravest to die for someone else’s country.",
    "We still can get this right, and Washington elites need to stop their hand-wringing about another impossible choice where America loses either way.",
    "President Trump understood that Germany has more leverage over Putin, and it’s in Germany’s interest - as well as NATO’s - to exercise it.",
    "But the choice before us is not between letting Putin extort the free world or shedding the blood of American Troops in battle.",
    "Every Russian financial institution needs to be blocked from using SWIFT, and our EU partners need to back us in this effort.",
    "That’s the best way Americans can help freedom-seeking people around the globe avoid horrific fates at the hands of tyrants.",
    "The rise of this perilous situation between Russia and Ukraine is as important as what we should do about it now.",
    "President Biden’s weakness, negligence, and apathy encouraged Putin to act initially, without consequence.",
    "Putin is the consummate opportunist, looking to restore Russia’s Soviet-era sphere of influence.",
    "To be sure, there are far-reaching consequences to the abject failure of Biden’s foreign policy.",
    "Now it’s struggling to become more democratically free and is seeking western alliances.",
    "Harsh words and “hope” combined with half-measures aren’t courses of action.",
    "Ukraine’s history is replete with foreign abuse and domestic tragedies.",
    "Understandably, Americans are war-weary after 20 years in Afghanistan.",
    "But the invasion into sovereign Ukraine is not a surprise.",
    "First, we haven’t done nearly enough on sanctions."
