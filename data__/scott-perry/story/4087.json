    "The letter, according to the report, vows to press House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on unifying the party as it \"must once again decide whether they will vote to fund a federal government that is enforcing tyrannical COVID-19 vaccine mandates on the American people.\"",
    "After the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on Tuesday withdrew its vaccine mandate on business larger than 100 employees, the Republicans' letter targets four other COVID-19 vaccine mandates \"unilaterally imposed\" on healthcare workers, the military, federal government employees and contractors.",
