    "Crenshaw gained approval of Democrats when he called out fellow Republicans who cast doubt on the 2020 election results saying that claims of voter fraud were part of a “mass manipulation” by members of his own party, despite the fact that he had joined 125 other House Republicans in backing an unsuccessful lawsuit aimed at getting the Supreme Court to decide whether ballots in four states that Biden won had “significant and unconstitutional irregularities”, thus playing both sides of the street.",
    "He further attacked Trump after January 6th, 2021, writing on January 13th that he “condemned the President for the words and actions which contributed to these events, and encourage every member of Congress to similarly condemn.”, thereby falling in line with the new Democrat majority, while at the same time making a pro forma statement opposing a second impeachment of Trump, basically saying that the President was leaving office anyway, and we need to get back to business without him.",
    "The Freedom Caucus was founded by conservative stalwarts such as former Representative and now Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former Representative and Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and current Representative Jim Jordan, and includes members such as Rep. Andy Biggs, Rep. Mo Brooks, Rep. Scott Perry, Rep. Louie Gohmert, Rep. Debbie Lesko, and Rep. Matt Gaetz.",
    "In a video that went viral, he also attacked an 11-year-old boy who asked him about his comparing Jesus to a Marvel Comic Book hero by repeatedly shouting “don’t question my faith!”\nMaybe in some alternate universe version of Franklin County, a guy like Dan Crenshaw might belong on stage for a Republican event, but he certainly doesn’t here, and now.",
    "Crenshaw, who just survived a primary challenge from multiple conservative candidates in his own Texas district, has become the darling of the liberal media for his anti-Trump rhetoric and support of other anti-Trump Republicans such as Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both of whom were hand-picked by Nancy Pelosi to sit on the January 6th Commission.",
    "To feature a RINO never-Trumper on the same platform where we’ll have statewide candidates wanting Trump’s support and in front of a Trump-supporting audience is more than just clueless; it borders on willful recklessness, or more appropriately from the current party leadership, another case of willful negligence.",
    "This last fact makes it likely that Congressman Joyce was called in at the last minute to help salvage the Lincoln Day Dinner, which will take place two months later than normal due to the inability of the event’s organizers to put it together.",
    "Crenshaw was also one of the establishment Republicans who lined up with Congressman John Joyce and every House Democrat to vote for funding of a vaccination database to keep tabs on who was getting the Covid19 jab, among other things.",
    "In a now-deleted Facebook post, which has been preserved online and which Crenshaw does not deny, he referred to Trump as an “idiot” and celebrated that society progressed beyond biblical language on things like homosexual marriage.",
    "He has been an Amateur Radio Operator since 1988, getting his first license in Germany, and is a past volunteer with both Navy and Army MARS, Military Auxiliary Radio Service, and is also a certified firearms instructor.",
    "Guest columnist\nIt’s not official, but the scuttlebutt is that the Franklin County Republican Party’s speaker for its Lincoln Day Dinner will be virulently anti-Trump congressman Dan Crenshaw.",
    "Perhaps the most egregious and revealing episode of Crenshaw’s behavior is his wholesale denunciation of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative House Republicans.",
    "He has been in leadership roles for the Republican Party in two states, most recently serving two terms as Chairman of the Franklin County Republican Party.",
    "We’re worried about what people are going to do to us, what they’re going to infringe upon us.”\nNo wonder Crenshaw has become known as “McCain 2.0”.",
    "He is retired from the United States Department of Defense, where his career included assignments In Europe, Asia and Central America.",
    "Assuming this is true, this will go down as probably the most bone-headed decision in the history of the local party.",
    "Crenshaw attacked the conservative organization calling its members “grifters” and “performance artists”.",
    "Crenshaw is radioactive, especially to Trump supporters, who make up at least 90% of county Republicans.",
    "“Lie after lie after lie because they know something psychologically about the conservative heart.",
    "Involved in web publishing since 1996, he is the publisher of The Franklin County Journal.",
    "Dwight Weidman is a resident of Greene Township and is a graduate of Shepherd University.",
    "We have grifters in our midst … in the conservative movement,” he added.",
    "Crenshaw’s duplicity was betrayed early on, before he ran for congress.",
    "Heck, why not invite Nancy Pelosi and go the full monty?",
    "He said, “What you hear so often is not true.",
    "It’s not true."
