    "Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry said he plans to speak to caucus member Cawthorn about comments he made in a podcast likening the Capitol Hill culture to the Netflix series “House of Cards.”\n“I think it is important, if you’re going to say something like that, to name names,” Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, said of Cawthorn in an interview with Politico.",
