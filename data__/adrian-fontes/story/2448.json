    "\"I don't think it's going anywhere as a legal matter,\" Barnes said,\n\"An added filing by a partisan on the ground in Arizona is less relevant although it's an important political item of the day.\"",
    "\"While public reports have indicated that DOJ investigations may be ongoing, I have no personal knowledge that Arizona's slate of fake electors is under investigation,\" Fontes said.",
    "\"It stands to reason at least one person in Arizona with personal knowledge of the truth must come forward and stand up for what's right.",

    "In July, the Wards joked on social media about requests by Democrats to have Attorney General Mark Brnovich investigate her.",
    "\"If the U.S. Congress is investigating your behavior around the 2020 election that's a pressure point,\" Barnes said.",
    "The January 6th Commission is seeking the Wards phone records from November 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021.",
    "The Wards signed documents falsely claiming to be among the state's presidential electors in 2020.",
    "Republican political consultant Stan Barnes sees Fontes' criminal complaint as a political move.",
    "PHOENIX â€” More potential legal problems for Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward.",
    "ABC15 reached out to Kelli Ward and the attorney representing her and her husband.",
    "\"Wow big news, big news today, Kelli Ward trying to influence the election.",
    "There is no word yet on when a judge will rule on their request.",
    "The Wards are attempting to block the subpoenas.",
    "But the subpoenas this week are no joke.",
    "We have not received a response.",
    "Kelli and Michael Ward said.",
    "That's what I did today.\"",
    "Isn't that illegal?\""
