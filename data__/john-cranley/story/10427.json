    "Ohio’s unemployment rate has rebounded from the pandemic and is slightly lower than what it was two years ago, but the workforce has shrunk by about 190,000 people.",
    "“They’ve gotten rich and Ohio families have fallen further and further behind.”\nThe result, Cranley said, is that Ohioans are falling behind most Americans.",
    "“Folks that are running the statehouse right now are more interested in lining their pockets than helping places like Marietta and Mansfield,” she said.",

    "Just once did they spar, even slightly, over abortion.",
