    "So let’s say a national poll of a sampling of registered voters, with an MoE of +/- 3, has:\nJoe Biden at 53%\nDonald Trump at 47%\nYou can be 95% certain that a hypothetical poll of all registered U.S. voters would yield results between these extremes:\nBiden 56/Trump 44 (+3 more for Biden, -3 fewer for Trump)\nTrump 50/Biden 50 (+3 more for Trump, -3 fewer for Biden)\nRenacci, a former congressman from Northeast Ohio, has tried to position himself as the biggest threat to DeWine's reelection.",
    "Previous polls commissioned by Renacci's campaign and an anti-DeWine political action committee, including one in mid-January, showed him leading the incumbent governor, but polls commissioned by campaigns and PACs notoriously often favor the supported candidate.",
    "Trafalgar an accurate recent pollster\nAs NBC4 explained in December when Trafalgar released the first independent survey of Ohio's GOP Senate race, the pollster has been among the most accurate in Ohio despite not explaining its methodology in great detail.",
    "A poll of 1,066 likely GOP primary voters conducted Feb. 1-4 by the Trafalgar Group found 40.9% would vote for DeWine, while 22.8% and 20.2% would vote for challengers Jim Renacci and Joe Blystone, respectively.",
    "The Atlanta-based pollster correctly predicted former President Donald Trump would win the Ohio last year, as a poll days before the election favored him over President Joe Biden by 4.8 percentage points.",
    "For most polls, you can read the margin of error (MoE) like this: If the poll were to be done again 100 times, in 95 of those times the results would be within “X” percentage points of the original.",
    "Trafalgar also correctly predicted Trump winning the presidency in 2016, and FiveThirtyEight rated it the second most accurate pollster for the 2020 election despite it predicting a Biden loss.",
    "Trafalgar's poll, however, suggests his battle is currently with outsider candidate Joe Blystone, a farmer from Canal Winchester who, like Renacci, is running to DeWine's right.",
    "The poll has a margin of error of 2.99 percentage points, meaning each candidate’s advantage could swing about six points in either direction if the poll was done again.",
    "Mike DeWine has a formidable advantage in his bid for reelection, according to the first independent survey of Ohio’s Republican gubernatorial primary, released Monday.",
    "The pollster's only previous poll of a governor's race, however, predicted DeWine would lose the 2018 general election to Democrat Richard Cordray by 3.6 points.",
    "On the Democratic side, a two-way contest between former Cincinnati mayor John Cranley and former Dayton mayor Nan Whaley, has yet to be independently polled.",
    "Its surveys are also shorter and try to accommodate for a recent trend of respondents intentionally giving false answers because of who is asking and why.",
    "DeWine’s 18-point lead over Renacci would survive that error margin, a further solidification of his status as frontrunner for the May 3 primary.",
    "Elected in 2018, he's overseen Ohio's COVID-19 response, which began as one of America's more proactive but is now typical of a purple state.",
    "Renacci left his seat in 2018 to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in his reelection, but he lost by about 7 points.",
    "Trafalgar notes on its website that it uses a mix of techniques like live calls, texts and emails to conduct polls.",
    "The remaining 16.1%, per the conservative-leaning pollster’s survey, are still undecided or do not plan to vote.",
    "The country's 9th-most popular governor, he's criticized by both parties but can point to bipartisan victories.",
    "That poll’s margin of error was just 2.96 points, and Trump won Ohio by just over 8 points.",
    "Trafalgar's poll was conducted before former state Rep. Ron Hood entered the race.",
    "The poll-tracking website gives Trafalgar an overall A-minus rating.",
    "Trafalgar's survey is the first neutral look at the race.",
    "Blystone has no political experience.",
    "DeWine, 74, is seeking a second term.",
    "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Gov.",
    "DeWine won by 3.7 points."
