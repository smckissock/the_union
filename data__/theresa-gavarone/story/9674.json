    "In the state high court’s majority opinion, justices wrote: “public safety, although of the utmost importance, is not a factor relevant to the calculation of the bail amount.",
    "“We believe that the interest of the community — the safety of the community — is just as important as a defendant's right to a fair trial and his presumption of innocence.",
    "“The bottom line is that the decision by the [Ohio Supreme Court] is a direct threat to public safety and we are here today to fix that,” said State Sen. Theresa Gavarone.",
    "In his appeal, which was granted by the 1st District Court of Appeals, the lower court ruled DuBose’s bail was excessive and, thus, unconstitutional.",
    "“Presumption of innocence in court is not the same as pretending that a career criminal poses no threat on the street,” Yost said.",
