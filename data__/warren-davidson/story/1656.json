    "Such transactions may be attractive to illicit actors due to anonymity, the lack of limits on portability, mobility, transaction speed, and usability.” FATF also advises cryptocurrency exchanges to, “...collect data on their unhosted wallet transfers, and monitor and assess that information as necessary to determine to what extent a transaction is within their risk appetite, and the appropriate risk-based controls to apply...”.",
    "This has proven the utility value of decentralized platforms like bitcoin.” It was like a breath of fresh air when Foss saw how a political leader in the U.S. take a policy stand with a new bill about the importance of self-custody and privacy rights in peer-to-peer crypto transactions.",

    "But the law right now is ... they have identified any source of funding as an illegal activity.” After our interview, Foss did make one small confession - he was in fact a Montreal Canadiens fan which in much of Ontario, he stated he knew was ‘sacrilege’.",
    "As originally reported in the Toronto Star last Monday, February 7, Greg Foss, a Canadian and former hedge fund manager, was identified as one of five ‘multi-signature’ key holders of the Bitcoin raised for the ‘Freedom convoy’ trucker protests in Canada.",

    "With respect to recent guidance on unhosted wallets (self-hosted wallets) and P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions, FATF advises countries to, “...be aware of the risk posed by...transfers to/from unhosted wallets and related P2P transactions.",
    "When GoFundMe froze the funds from a “Freedom Convoy 2022” page - with donations totaling $7.9 million dollars - an opportunity presented itself to demonstrate how the censorship-resistance feature that bitcoin might work in real life.",
    "When Foss received the breaking news about the RCMP, he shared with me that, “The Royal Canadian Mounted Police orders a blacklist of 34 digital wallets which can now be seized under the Executive Orders under this Emergencies Act.",
    "Ultimately, the fight over self-custody of coins will likely be a major policy issue that will be discussed in the U.S., while the events in Canada has accelerated the position regarding the ability to sanction cryptocurrency.",
    "Yes it was, but at the time it was not illegal.” After the Emergencies Act became effective, Foss declared he quickly removed himself from any involvement as a multi-signature key holder for the Bitcoin that was raised.",
    "And we’re going to take advantage of it.” Fast-forward to this week, when Foss saw his country decide to invoke the ‘Emergency Measures’ Act that allowed law enforcement to freeze cryptocurrency transactions.",

    "Disclosure: I own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
    "Was my name associated with a big fundraise?",
    "It doesn’t mean I agree with all the laws.",
