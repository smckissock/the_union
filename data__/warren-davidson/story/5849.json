    "Sarah Longwell, the group’s executive director and publisher of The Bulwark (thebulwark.com), a news network that provides political reporting and analysis \"free from the constraints of partisan loyalties,\" attempted to explain the power of the \"Big Lie\" that Trump won the 2020 election.",
    "Why can’t more Republicans show the kind of integrity and willingness to compromise that Heimlich has consistently, going back to when Trump emerged on his fumbling quest to transform this country into an oligarchy led by one more rich would-be autocrat.",
    "A huge part of the reason they have no idea, Longwell writes, is that the news sources they pay attention to (here’s looking at you, Fox) and candidates and public officials they voted for are going along with it.",
    "Elected officials, courts and law enforcement on both sides of the political spectrum examined the possibility of fraud in the election and found that if it happened at all, it could not have changed the outcome.",
    "In a recent Enquirer news story, Hamilton County GOP Party Chairman Alex Triantafilou said of Heimlich’s run against Davidson: \"If he thinks he’s rescuing us from Donald Trump, he’s mistaken.",
    "I hesitate to use the word \"party\" to describe what has become for so many in it a snarling, delusional cult with Trump ensconced as its chief snarler and truth denier.",
    "Warren Davidson, Heimlich’s opponent in Ohio’s 8th District GOP primary, is among the Trump minions unwilling to admit that President Biden won the election.",
    "How does the Republican Party find more candidates who have crawled out from under the anti-democratic, mendacious, bloated boulder that is Donald Trump?",
    "But as the news organization Axios’ Jonathan Swan put it to Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell in a recent interview: \"Where is your moral red line?\"",
    "Republicans for the Rule of Law (ruleoflawrepublicans.com) is among the organizations working to restore the party’s integrity.",
    "Longwell speaks often to focus groups and has concluded that people who believe the Big Lie don’t believe it’s a lie.",
    "Heimlich, and a lot of other Republicans, even those who won’t say so, see through this Wizard-of-Oz-like curtain.",
    "He almost surely knows that Biden won legitimately but calculates that it’s not politically expedient to say so.",
    "The officials do it to prop up their approval ratings, and Fox does it mostly to bolster its viewership.",
    "You sir, are trying to save the Republican Party from choking as it maneuvers to swallow Donald Trump.",
    "Your famous father devised a maneuver to save people from choking on food while trying to swallow.",
    "They, like a lot of politicians, put holding office and winning elections above almost all else.",
    "But this is clearly another political ploy made despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary.",
    "They are not bad people, she’s concluded, they simply have no idea that they are being lied to.",
    "Dave Caudill of Mount Lookout is a freelance writer and editor and a former Enquirer staffer.",
    "Such a position has become the litmus test for a Trump endorsement, and Davidson has that.",
    "Let’s try to understand what puts so many Republican officeholders in thrall to Trump.",
    "Many Republicans like to cite \"problems\" with vote counting in the 2020 elections.",
    "The unfailing truth is that Trump lost the 2020 election by some 7 million votes.",
    "Why back such a poor loser who can’t even admit that he lost?",
    "He’s the very definition of a politician without backbone.",
    "Heimlich is part of a far-too-rare cohort of the GOP.",
    "Opinion contributor\nPhil Heimlich, I salute you.",
    "Presumably, it helps him to sleep at night.",
    "Fortunately, Heimlich is not alone either.",
    "Consequently, the lie perpetuates itself.",
    "But, of course, Davidson is not alone.",
    "Mr. Triantafilou, how does it work?",
    "That’s not how it works.\""
