    "Rep. Warren Davidson to Newsmax: Calls for K-3 Sex Ed 'Mind Blowing' (Newsmax/\"National Report\")\nBy Eric Mack | Monday, 11 April 2022 08:20 PM\nWhile Democrats are complaining Republicans are seeking to pass legislation to keep public schools from teaching sex education to elementary school kids, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, told Newsmax it is \"mind blowing\" such laws are even needed.",
    "Davidson is also a part of a GOP-led lawsuit against the Centers for Disease Control and the Transportation Security Administration to stop the mandates of face masks on airline travelers, taking a shot at Dr. Anthony Fauci for imposing mandates on Americans without authority.",

    "\"It's really odd that we would even need to pass a bill that says you don't do sex education with kindergartners through third-graders,\" Davidson told Monday's \"National Report.\"",
    "\"New Jersey's planning on intentionally including that in the curriculum for their kindergarten through third-graders: This is mind blowing,\" Davidson told host Rob Finnerty.",
    "Frankly, even our own State Department early on offered Zelenskyy a ride out of the country, and Zelenskyy boldly said, 'I don't need a ride, I need ammunition.'",
    "Davidson rebuked Democrats' opposition to age-appropriate sex education, noting some Democrats are even looking to codify it in their states.",
    "\"They don't have the authority to issue this mandate, which means the TSA doesn't have the authority to enforce it,\" Davidson said.",
    "Davidson is running for reelection in Ohio's 8th District, facing Phil Heimlich in the GOP House primary, and voting is underway.",
    "These unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats like Dr. Fauci have imposed their will on the country and people felt unrepresented.\"",
    "\"The idea that Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelenskyy could walk through the streets of Kyiv is not something people expected.",
    "Davidson is a former Army Ranger and is vehemently opposed to President Joe Biden's handling of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
    "\"And, frankly, in most of our school districts you wouldn't need to do that, but apparently some are.\"",
    "\"I don't think it would pass right now, but there might have been a point in time where it would have.",
    "So whether you want it or don't, which all of us on this suit don't, it should be done the right way.",
    "\"Look at the difference that kind of bold leadership made for the people in Ukraine.\"",
    "Note: See Newsmax TV now carried in more than 100 million U.S. homes, on DirecTV Ch.",
    "Democrat Vanessa Enoch awaits in the general election in November.",
    "\"I've very excited to see Kyiv secure,\" Davidson said.",
    "\"Congress did not delegate this authority to the CDC.",
