    "Republican Senate candidate Jim Lamon hopes to unseat Sen. Mark Kelley (D–AZ) with the help of an ad set in the Wild West days in which he, sporting a sheriff's costume, scares Kelly, President Joe Biden, and Nancy Pelosi out of town by shooting weapons out of their hands.",
    "Political ads by Republicans glamorizing violence against Democrats is a growing trend, with disgraced general Michael Flynn, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R–CO), and Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R–AZ) among the GOP who have created their own weapon-waving videos.",
    "In 2011, Kelly's wife, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), was shot in the head, making Lamon's distasteful showdown ad all the more appalling."
