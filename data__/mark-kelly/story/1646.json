    "Lamon is clearly looking to get attention in a crowded Republican primary, and intends to run this ad during the Super Bowl this coming weekend.",
    "Last month he got a lot of mileage out of a \"Let's Go Brandon\" ad that was rejected by Yahoo for being \"overly inflammatory and offensive.\"",
    "But anonymously, since he didn't want to attach his name to this shit if yet another deranged MAGA loon takes this stuff seriously.",
