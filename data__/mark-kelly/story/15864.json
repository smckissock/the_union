    "?Images of Russia’s Attack on Ukraine\n—Trump Calls Putin’s Ukraine Moves “Genius” Because He Hates Democracy\n— The Zucker-Cuomo Saga Just Got Even Messier\n— Why Biden Wanted Americans to Know Exactly What Putin Was Planning\n— It’s Been a Hell of a Week for Letitia James\n— “If Ukraine Matters, Tell Us Why”: Joe Biden Is Talking to Everyone Except the American People\n— Republicans on Russia Crisis: It’s Biden’s Fault\n— Thieves in the Night: A Vast Burglary Ring From Chile Has Been Targeting Wealthy U.S.",
    "Shortly after Russia’s onslaught, when the U.S. and Europe announced the first of multiple sanctions against Putin’s government, his cronies, and the nation’s economy, including limits on technology exchanges, Dmitry Rogozin, the blustery head of Roscosmos, Russia’s space program, pointed out that a Russian rocket—operated by two onboard cosmonauts—was responsible for keeping the ISS from crashing down to earth and on a path that avoids space debris and satellites.",
    "The retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly (twin brother of Arizona senator Mark Kelly, the ex-astronaut spouse of former Representative Gabby Giffords) fired back at Rogozin’s Twitterstorm, in Russian no less, telling Rogozin, as reported by the Daily Beast, “Maybe you can find a job at McDonald’s if McDonald’s still exists in Russia.” (This week, in fact, the fast-food behemoth announced it was suspending operations at its Russian outposts.)",
    "Despite the near complete rupture in U.S. and European relations with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, James Green, NASA’s chief scientist until he retired this past January (he now serves as an adviser to the space agency), insists in an email to me, “We continue to have our space relationship with our Russian cosmonaut colleagues [that] remain[s] the same, just like all our other international partners.",
    "“And,” he wrote, “I felt a nation attacked.” Even without seeing the assault directly, Culbertson, Friend writes, “nonetheless was shaken to the core.” In his onboard diary, Culbertson, who was the sole American crew member on his mission at the time, recounted, “It’s difficult to describe how it feels to be the only American completely off the planet at a time such as this.",
    "But people in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol—and in Moscow, Washington, D.C., and virtually any other city on Earth for that matter—are catching sight of the International Space Station (ISS), the third brightest object in the sky, not to mention one of the most expensive, technical, and politically complex multinational partnerships ever undertaken.",
    "Rogozin’s response was to reportedly dub Kelly a “moron”; Kelly, in return, called Rogozin “a child.”\nMai’a Cross, an Edward W. Brooke Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at Boston’s Northeastern University, has written extensively about diplomacy surrounding the ISS and other space programs.",
    "In a series of angry tweets, he warned, “If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled de-orbit and fall into the United States or Europe?” His message about the scientific endeavor was clear: Remain our partner or risk the possibility of a fiery reentry of a dangerous projectile.",
    "Meantime, the space station keeps circling the globe, held aloft by Russian and Ukrainian rockets; American, Japanese, European, and Russian technologies and funds, with NASA contributing the lion’s share of the ISS support costs; and the cooperation that has sent voyagers from 18 nations into orbit.",
    "Although wider technology exchanges ended after Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, cooler heads in Moscow and Washington prevailed, and Roscosmos announced its intention to continue ISS cooperation with NASA all the way to the station’s currently planned dismantlement, recently extended to 2031.",
    "Since then, NASA has primarily used Russia’s Cold War workhorse Soyuz rockets to bring crews, cargo, and waste back and forth between Earth and the ISS, where astronauts carry out studies on the effects of space travel, climate change on Earth, and various other nonmilitary scientific endeavors.",
    "Of course, we try to get together for dinners, when we discuss current affairs, and to watch TV shows and movies, but unfortunately, not every day.”\nThe men and women inside the ISS haven’t exactly been available for comment, but the crew has a unique vantage point on events in Ukraine.",
    "She finds Rogozin’s warnings laughable and in an interview with News@Northeastern said, “This boils down to a ridiculous scenario.” Without all sides continuing to cooperate, she noted, the ISS would indeed come crashing down, taking all aboard with it.",
    "“Crews work together during the flight onboard Soyuz and during emergency practice drills,” veteran cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky told Smithsonian magazine not long after a previous tumultuous period following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.",
    "Remarkably, along with the shared American and Russian contributions to keeping the ISS functioning, even amid the worst military crisis in Europe since the Second World War, Ukraine itself plays its own vital role in the space station program.",
    "Before he blasted off for his 2014 mission to the ISS, Crimean-born cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, who happens to be commander of the current Expedition 66 crew, made a widely reported visit to his homeland on behalf of the Russian space program.",
    "“One of those places you find yourself hanging out in all the time because all you want to do is look back at our planet.”\nAnd very likely the eyes of the Expedition 66 crew are fixed on the war, just as the rest of humanity is.",
    "Nearly as long as a football field, the 16 modules that make up the space station, might appear too delicate to survive while hurtling along through space at roughly 17,150 miles per hour (that’s about five miles per second).",
    "While we do not know the specifics of what ISS voyagers are seeing, many satellite images have shown the massing of Russian forces before the invasion and that stalled, 40-mile-long convoy of Russian armored vehicles.",
    "Inside the ISS, the seven crew members of what is denoted as Expedition 66—four Americans, two Russians, and a German—must ignore the violence and political rupture going on below them and continue to cooperate.",
    "In one 2012 video now online, Expedition 33 commander Suni Williams, an American astronaut acting as a tour guide through the ISS, took earth viewers to a windowed cupola, “like a glass bottom boat,” she said.",
    "The first-stage assembly for many rockets, including the American Antares rockets, are designed and manufactured by Ukraine’s Yuzhnoye State Design Office and Yuzhmash manufacturing rocketry complex in Dnipro.",
    "The feeling that I should be there with all of you, dealing with this, helping in some way, is overwhelming.”\nSpace has long been a safe haven where Americans and Russians have gone to learn how to get along.",
    "If nations, after all these years, can manage to keep the ISS orbiting the planet through hot war and frosty political relations, even now the hope remains that we can learn to cooperate here on the ground.",
    "In 2014 when Russia annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, a few Russian politicians called for ending Roscosmos’ cooperation with NASA after comparatively mild American sanctions were put in place.",
    "But in the darkness, an easily visible, unwavering point of white light will sweep over the heads of Ukrainians and Russians alike for a few minutes most nights, like a cue ball shot across the heavens.",
    "Cosmic Irony: Russians and Americans Cooperate Every Day—On the Space Station\nCosmonauts and astronauts provide a terrestrial lesson: The most peaceful place these days may be 240 miles above the Earth.",
    "“It is impossible for this space station to exist without teamwork.”\nMeantime, the crew members remain tight—and not simply as the zero-G equivalents of roomies in a small Manhattan or Moscow flat.",
    "In a very real sense, then, as the world comes apart at the seams, the plucky ISS continues to operate—as it has for almost a quarter century—as an enduring symbol of international partnership.",
    "A 1993 faxed letter from the then directors of Roscosmos fortuitously arrived at the White House with the suggestion that Russia and America combine their space station programs.",
    "According to NASA, the ISS orbits the Earth about every 90 minutes, 16 times a day, at an altitude of some 240 miles above the planet, a height known as low-earth orbit.",
    "The idea of a space station built with other nations started out during the Clinton administration partly to hold down costs for a continuing American space presence.",
    "As recounted in Watching the World Change, a book by Vanity Fair’s own David Friend, Culbertson witnessed the spreading smoke from the collapse of the Twin Towers.",
    "Known as the “rocket city” for its vaunted rocket engine facilities, the south-central Ukrainian city is reportedly an important target for the Russian invaders.",
    "They’re really good friends when they’re up there.” (The space station has about 13,700 cubic feet of livable space—roughly the area of four semitruck trailers.",
    "As the ISS flies over a blacked-out Ukraine, explosions from artillery and missile fire and flames from burning structures are almost certainly visible.",
    "After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the ISS looked like a symbolic and very real way to embark on post–Cold War opportunities for collaboration.",
    "The ISS remains a small, fast-moving pinpoint of light that billions of people can still look up to as it passes through our present darkness.",
    "As astronaut Culbertson remarked in looking down from the ISS to where the Twin Towers once stood, “Tears don’t flow the same in space.”\n— ?",
    "This is why the ISS is always a beacon of hope, even when there’s conflict on earth, because these space people are actually quite close.",
    "The 1975 epoch-making “handshake in space” between NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts was a first big step in ending the Cold War.",
    "They have no choice: Even as they can almost certainly see evidence of the war with their own eyes, they must live and work together.",
    "If unaware of the light’s source, Ukrainians may fear it is yet another lethal Russian weapon seeking to rain its wrath down on them.",
    "Systems need regular maintenance and occasional repairs; spacewalks are routine; meals need preparation; waste must get removed.",
    "The then ISS mission commander, Frank Culbertson, drafted an open letter to friends and family explaining what he was seeing.",
    "Their lives depend on each other, and before they even went up there, they were training together for months, if not years.",
    "Nothing about the ISS could continue without the crew members’ interdependent contributions to their mutual survival.",
    "“You have to remember that these astronauts and cosmonauts are really good friends at this point,” Cross contended.",
    "This is necessary to maintain the ongoing safe operation of the ISS.” And that last statement is worth noting.",
    "Russia, in retaliation for the sanctions, even threatened to bar U.S. astronauts’ access to the space station.",
