    "And so now they’re apparently in some negotiations to say, “OK, we’re going to relieve you from some of the sanctions we placed on you, Venezuela, and in exchange for you producing more oil.”\nSo far OPEC has said no to President Biden and said, “We’re sticking with our contract that we made with Russia, and we’re only going to produce X amount of oil and gas.” And basically said, “We don’t care what you think, Biden.”\nIt’s really a sad state of affairs and shows the American people how quickly policies can change.",
    "So I believe Republicans will introduce legislation to codify into law some of the rules and regulations that the Trump administration put forward when he was in office in order to reduce the time for permitting of new production facilities, reduce the time of permitting for new pipelines, and help Americans increase U.S. oil and gas production, U.S. energy production, and quite frankly, all things.",
    "Blair: Now, we recently had a meeting from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce titled “Gouged at the Gas Station: Big Oil and America’s Pain at the Pump.” This was a meeting that was called by Democratic representatives and is seemingly placing all of the blame for the current gas crisis and energy crisis on big business and big oil.",
    "“Republicans will introduce legislation to codify into law some of the rules and regulations that the Trump administration put forward … to reduce the time for permitting of new production facilities, reduce the time of permitting for new pipelines, and help Americans increase U.S. oil and gas production,” Lesko says.",
    "It’s so much burdensome regulatory that the financial markets and the capital people are like, “Wow, we don’t want to lend new oil and gas production, capital money, because the Biden administration is so against it.”\nAnd so it’s from all angles that the Biden administration is trying to hurt oil and gas.",
    "Rep. Debbie Lesko, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has some answers on today’s edition of “The Daily Signal Podcast.”\nLesko, R-Ariz., pledges that if the GOP regains the majority in Congress, lawmakers will act swiftly to reduce gas prices and increase America’s energy independence.",
    "Blair: We’ve heard that the president has been very open about his desire to use the sort of weight of the federal government to push for climate-friendly/climate change initiatives, including those pipelines that you mentioned, and a lot of these other natural gases and natural resources in America.",
    "And that’s why it’s always fun for me to see at the gas pumps in Arizona those little stickers like this one, it’s like, “I did that.” And they keep popping up and I think the gas stations take them down because you can see all the little sticker marks, but then people keep putting them up.",
    "Now, I think electric vehicles are becoming more and more popular, but let’s face it, electric vehicles need a lot of critical minerals that are not made or mined in the United States because the Biden administration has closed down mining permits in the United States.",
    "Blair: Now, as we begin to wrap-up, is there a conservative solution that we can pursue to lower these gas prices while still being aware of the fact that we have a hostile administration who’s going to try and prevent conservative policies from being instituted?",
    "They have control of the House, control of the Senate, control of the presidency, and they’re basically doing whatever the heck they want, whether it’s on their open-border policies or now their war against American-made energy.",

    "And it’s not just that he stopped a leasing of federal lands for new oil and gas production, but it’s the financial pressures he’s putting on businesses that want to produce new oil and gas with all of these restrictions.",
    "And quite frankly, politically, this is going to be a hard year for U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, between the inflation that’s going on in Arizona and the border crisis that’s going on in Arizona’s border and across the nation.",
    "Lesko: Well, I think if President Biden vetoes every single bill that Republicans put forward, assuming we get back the majority in the House and the Senate, then I think it will lead to a Republican president in 2024.",
    "We have to put forth the legislation, whether we think that President Biden is going to veto it or not, because we have to show to the American public that we are working for them and we are working for America.",
    "I mean, just look at this chart and it shows that as soon as Biden and the Democrats took one-party Democrat control, the gas prices started soaring, and it wasn’t until later on that the war actually broke out.",
    "They’re like, “OK, let’s blame this group, let’s blame this group, so that maybe one of these will stick and the American people will actually buy it.”\nWell, I don’t think the American people are buying it.",
    "Blair: That does occur to me, like I mentioned, it will be difficult, obviously, with President Biden in the White House, who is not particularly conducive to these types of policies that we’re proposing.",
    "Blair: As we continue to see federal mismanagement of energy and of energy policy, are we seeing that your state has done anything to maybe mitigate some of the worst consequences of these gas prices?",

    "Even the [Securities and Exchange Commission] has now more burdensome restrictions on all companies reporting their emissions and their supplier’s emissions and their supplier’s emissions.",
    "If Republicans are to gain back power, and if they are able to regain a majority in the House, what is the plan to give relief to Americans struggling from these gas prices right now?",
    "We want to have the political power that comes along with that for national security, that we don’t have to rely on hostile adversaries for our oil and gas and our energy needs.",
    "Blair: As a representative in Congress, are you seeing that the Biden administration is trying to use Congress to get this solution solved or are they ignoring you entirely?",
    "Doug Blair: My guest today is Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, who represents Arizona’s 8th Congressional District and is a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.",
    "And when their utility prices go up, when their gasoline prices go up, when their medicine prices go up, their health care costs go up, they often don’t know where to turn.",

    "If we get back the Republican majority in the House and the Senate, we’re going to introduce legislation that will incentivize new oil and gas production in America.",
    "And he talked about how just about every meeting he met with foreign countries, he negotiated using U.S. energy as a tool because other countries want U.S. energy.",
    "And Biden’s answer is so out of step with the American public, saying, “Buy an electric car.”\nI mean, first of all, an electric vehicle costs quite a bit of money.",
    "Lesko: The Trump administration did a lot of great policies by reducing regulations on American businesses to produce oil and gas and other American businesses.",
    "Blair: So in that vein, do you see the American people maybe responding to this claim that it’s big oil or it’s big business that is causing these gas prices?",

    "Because the American people will see that we are trying to reverse some of the bad policies that Biden and the Democrats put forward, and we have to do it.",
    "And quite frankly, Biden and his administration and the Democrat policies have really tanked just about everything that’s going on in the United States.",
    "And then he goes in March, and they go to talk to the Venezuelan president, which, this guy has all kinds of atrocities that he does against his people.",
    "That was Congresswoman Debbie Lesko, who represents Arizona’s 8th Congressional District and is a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.",
    "And that is going to really adversely affect not only are national debt, the amount of interest that we are paying, but our national security as well.",
    "And so I think that we will put more leverage on the Biden administration, especially if both the House and the Senate go back to Republican majority.",
    "But when President Biden and the Democrats who are in control go against us and go against the Arizona citizens all the time, it’s hard to overcome.",
    "Now, we talked a little bit about how Republicans will need to be the commonsense people in the room to make sure that these gas prices go down.",

    "Do Republicans in Congress have any plans on how to push back against this type of legislation that makes us less energy-independent?",
    "Blair: We are seeing that there are massive differences between the Trump-based energy policies and the Biden-based energy policies.",
    "The Trump administration wanted more oil and gas to be produced in America because we want more Americans to have the great jobs.",
    "Lesko: Well, we’re going to incentivize that there is U.S. production of oil and gas and that we again become energy-independent.",
    "Lesko discusses the Biden administration’s failure to manage gas prices, and what congressional Republicans see as the solutions.",
    "But obviously, if we are now reliant on Russia for oil or Venezuela for oil, that puts us in a terrible national security risk.",
    "Blair: Now, you did mention Arizona, and obviously, as a Western state, natural resources are something that you would rely on.",
    "Lesko: Well, it’s very clear to me that [President Joe] Biden and the Democrat policies are to blame for the high gas prices.",

    "Now, it depends kind of how much majority we have, and wouldn’t it be nice if we had 60 Republicans in the Senate?",
    "And does Congress have any plans, if the Republican majority is to come back, to reinstitute that legislatively?",
    "Lesko: Well, Republicans are going to introduce legislation when and if we are back in the Republican majority.",
    "But hopefully, if Republicans control both the House and the Senate, we’ll have a bit more leverage with him.",
    "In Arizona, the Biden administration shut down a copper mine that the Trump administration had greenlighted.",
