Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) called it a “frightening decision.” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) called it “wrong.” And Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) said the Biden administration “does not appear to be ready” for the surge in migration that could result.",

    "The Biden administration is expected to end COVID-related border policy Title 42 in May, which officials warn will likely spur an additional influx on an already-strained department…\n“Seven thousand a day is not sustainable in multiple respects,” Johnson stated.",
    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Friday it would on May 23 rescind the order that blocks migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. as the country learns to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.",
    "“It overwhelms the Border Patrol and ICE and their ability to keep up with these numbers, and obviously, it overwhelms the Biden administration politically.”\nHere’s the video:\nDemocrats in vulnerable seats are also against the idea.",
    "As bad as the assault on the southern border has been, it’s amazing to think that Biden could somehow make it worse.",
    "Even Obama’s DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson is speaking out against the idea.",
    "Kelly and Hassan both face difficult reelection battles in November.",
