    "+5\nView gallery\nAsylum-seeking migrants are detained by a Border Patrol agent after crossing the Rio Bravo river to turn themselves in to request asylum in El Paso, Texas on March 30, 2022\nThe federal government under Biden has continued to extend the state of the emergency in the U.S., leading Congresswoman Herrell to question why Title 42 would be lifted when there is still an ongoing emergency status.",
    "She explained that Republicans are trying to get 'at least some' Democrats to sign the discharge petitions, adding that they sent a letter to colleagues 'asking [Democrats] to step up to the plate' and support the PAUSE Act in order to 'help place the safety and welfare of the American people first'.",
    "+5\nView gallery\nNew Mexico Republican Representative Yvette Herrell (pictured) says the Biden administration is 'underestimating' how important border security is to Americans\n+5\nView gallery\nSince Biden took office in January 2021, CBP has encountered more than 2.2 million migrants and the border.",
    "The representative for the district containing the entirety of New Mexico's border with Mexico is pushing for Joe Biden to keep Title 42 in place, claiming the president is out of touch with desires of real Americans and that her state doesn't have the resources to deal with the impending influx.",
    "Herrell says if title 42 ends, up to 18,000 migrants count arrive at the border every day\nEven some Democrats, including Arizona Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly, broke with the party after reports emerged this week that the administration will put an end to Title 42 by May 23, 2022.",
    "'It just doesn't make sense that this administration now would be told these numbers, they're hearing these numbers, they know we're on track to meet that 2 million people here illegally, and yet, they don't seem to be alarmed about it,' Herrell said.",
    "She also said that it doesn't make sense to end a pandemic-related policy to stop the spread from coming over the border with mass amounts of migrants flooding there when the country remains in a state of emergency due to the public health crisis.",
    "She added: 'But we have to at least know who's coming into our country, we have to get a handle on the illicit drugs that are coming through the country, the sex trafficking, you know, the movement of illegals around our nation as a whole.'",
    "She also insisted that there is nothing hidden in the bill, specifically calling out that it would not require that Donald Trump's border wall be completed or any other special interest issues in order for the policy to remain in place.",
    "'Right now in the bill that we introduced, the PAUSE act, of course, [Title 42] would stay in effect until restrictions were lifted not only in our country, but in our neighboring countries – so Mexico, Canada,' she explained.",
    "The representative for New Mexico's 2nd congressional district introduced the Protecting Americans from Unnecessary Spread upon Entry Act (PAUSE) on January 25, 2021 – just days after President Biden was sworn into office.",
    "Herrell said that her so-called PAUSE bill is gaining traction in the House, which would stop the administration from ending pandemic-era Title 42 until COVID restrictions are lifted in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.",
    "To help border states, Herrell said, the federal government needs to keep Title 42 in place and reinstate the Migrant Protection Program (MPP), which is more commonly referred to as the Remain in Mexico policy.",
    "Herrell's office stays in contact with Border Patrol in her state to share information regarding migration – including estimates that 18,000 people per day could cross the border once Title 42 is lifted.",
    "Herrell says that she wrote two letters to her state's Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham last year requesting the New Mexico National Guard be deployed to help with the southern border crisis.",
    "Title 42 was enacted under former President Trump and allows for the instant expulsion of migrants and the ability to withhold hearing their asylum claims in the midst of the public health emergency.",
    "Herrell also lamented that while COVID restrictions are still in place even at the U.S. Capitol, there shouldn't be a relaxation on policies when it comes to national security in the pandemic.",
    "'If they do eliminate Title 42 completely, we may see up to 18,000 people per day coming across the southern border,' Representative Yvette Herrell told DailyMail.com in a Thursday interview.",
    "She explained that GOP Representative Chip Roy of Texas initiated a discharge petition on the act that, if the majority of Congress signs, can move the bill to the floor for a vote.",
    "'It's a very interesting conversation to be had because you're right in where we're seeing some of the mandates in terms of statewide mandates that are being lifted,' Herrell said.",
    "'But who's not turning a blind eye are the people of this nation and certainly the people that are in states that live and work right along the border, especially in New Mexico.'",
    "MPP was a Trump-era policy that allowed the U.S. to send migrants back to Mexico if that's where they entered the U.S. from to await court proceedings for their asylum claims.",
    "This means, according to the congresswoman, that all travel restrictions in all three North American countries must be lifted, as well as pandemic-era mandates.",
    "'Where other states can actually recognize the danger in having this many people come into the country illegally, the illicit drugs that are pouring through.'",
    "The congresswoman claims this would be helpful because it would help get border agents out of processing centers and back on the ground at the border.",
    "This decreased the chances that migrants would be released into the country and evade the immigration system, remaining in the U.S. illegally.",
    "'So clearly our governor has the same philosophy as the Biden administration – kind of out of sight, out of mind mentality,' Herrell accused.",
    "'We know that there's Democrats now that have come out and said they don't want Title 42 to go away,' Herrell told DailyMail.com.",
    "Herrell said that there are National Guard troops from other states at the New Mexico border but none from her own state.",
    "And I think as a country, we can all say yeah, COVID is very serious, and I think we all have been touched by the COVID.'",
    "'So on the federal level, in terms of congressionally, we are pushing hard to push that Title 42 bill, that PAUSE Act.'",
    "They claim that there is no adequate plan in place to quell southern border crossing without the presence of Title 42.",
    "'We don't have the resources to handle that because we just don't have enough boots on the ground,' she added.",
    "Herrell said that as of Wednesday there were over 200 Republican signatures and more have come in Thursday.",
    "Herrell claims that the proposed legislation is a single issue bill that would just keep Title 42 in play.",
    "The PAUSE Act would stop the administration from ending Title 42 until the pandemic were completely over.",
    "You know, we're still seeing really stringent rules in some places in the nation, not so much and others.",
    "'Again, health and safety – but yet a lot of people are willing to turn a blind eye,' she continued.",
    "'But, you know, here at the U.S. Capitol, everybody coming through has to go through security.",
    "They're still not allowing more than one tour a week per office on the House side.",
    "'And I think they're underestimating the concern the American people have.'",
    "You know, this is because of the COVID.",
    "Grisham never responded to her letters."
