    "Trump wrote the Brnovich \"was given massive information on the fraud and so-called 'irregularities' that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election.\"",
    "The report, though, did not please many of Arizona's most vocal election deniers, who have been calling for Brnovich to prosecute election officials.",
    "\"It's significant,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a political analyst and president of HighGround Inc., a largely Republican political consulting company.",
    "The former president released a scathing statement Monday, apparently frustrated that Brnovich had not taken further action on the 2020 election.",
    "All are overshadowed, though, by Kelly's fundraising: $38.9 million so far, including $11 million in just the first three months of 2022.",
    "Brnovich's efforts to make a show of his action on \"election integrity\" as attorney general did not impress the man from Mar-a-Lago.",
    "\"If it becomes the currency of a primary, our argument is it always debilitates that candidate in the general election,\" he said.",

    "So far, Lamon has raised the most money out of the Republican candidates, reporting $13.8 million so far this election cycle.",
    "On April 6, his office released an initial report on its investigation into allegations of election fraud in Maricopa County.",
    "Still, the race is expected to be highly competitive — and for the GOP candidates, an endorsement from Trump is desirable.",

    "So far, polls have not shown any clear frontrunner, with many voters reporting they are still undecided.",
    "But Brnovich stopped short of alleging that any crimes were committed, at least in this initial report.",
    "Brnovich is among several Republican candidates who are vying to unseat Democratic Senator Mark Kelly.",
    "Rogers was one of various Arizona Republicans who appeared at Trump's rally in Florence in January.",
    "There is no evidence of mass fraud in the 2020 election results, in Maricopa County or elsewhere.",
    "Brnovich was not invited to speak, and that night, Trump spoke favorably of Masters' candidacy.",
    "The county says these claims are speculative, and there is no concrete evidence of wrongdoing.",
    "Instead, he emphasized some of his office's other work on litigation over election issues.",
    "Brnovich has played to the pro-Trump, \"Stop-the-Steal\" crowd in recent weeks.",
