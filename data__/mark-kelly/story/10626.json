    "This was the second time Weil was nominated to the post and is the first time a Biden nominee failed on the 50-50 split Senate floor.",
    "Eventually he was advanced in a party-line vote when there was an absence at the time of Republican Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.",
    "Every single Republican also voted against Weil's nomination, making the final vote count against invoking cloture 47-53.",
