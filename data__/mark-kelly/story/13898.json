    "The six-figure campaign zones in on Democratic Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Democratic Nevada Sen. Catherine Masto-Cortez over their votes on the progressive abortion legislation — which the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has dubbed “the most radical abortion bill of all time.”\n“Our campaign is designed to educate and mobilize Hispanic voters to hold key Senators accountable for their radically misplaced priorities,” CatholicVote President Brian Burch said in a statement.",
    "“But we need politicians who will solve the growing problems of inflation, low wages, the cost of gas, and the endless consequences of COVID.”\n“Why [sic] we are baffled and frustrated that our Senator Catherine Cortez, instead of addressing these issues, is wasting her time on an abortion bill that will kill innocents and benefit not a single life of Nevada workers,” the ad concludes.",
    "“But we need politicians who solve real problems: the rising cost of food, gasoline, rising crime, and disrespect for parents in schools.”\nWATCH:\n“With these urgencies, what is our Senator Mark Kelly doing voting for a law that seeks to legalize abortion up to the very moment of birth without listening to parents?” the ad questions before issuing a call to action.",
    "“To educate and mobilize Hispanic voters to hold key Senators accountable for their radically misplaced priorities.”\nCatholicVote is launching a digital ad campaign urging Hispanic voters to challenge pro-abortion Catholic senators in Arizona and Nevada over their recent vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act.",
    "The campaign builds on Wall Street Journal polling showing that Republicans are gaining support among both black and Hispanic voters — the publication’s early March poll found that Hispanic voters would back a Republican candidate for Congress over a Democrat by 9 percentage points.",
    "“As these voters ask their elected officials to address skyrocketing gas prices, soaring crime and inflation, and the lingering consequences of excessive COVID mandates, senators in both Nevada and Arizona are instead pushing extreme abortion laws,” he added.",
    "WATCH:\nVoter turnout among Hispanics is expected to increase in both Arizona and in Nevada this year, as well as in Colorado, according to a February report on the 2022 Latino vote from the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.",
    "“Are you with us or with the powers behind unlimited abortion?”\nThe organization’s other ad targeting Nevada’s Hispanic voters expresses frustration that Masto-Cortez would focus her energies on progressive abortion laws over more pressing issues.",
    "“Hispanics are proud to contribute to a better nation with our work, our taxes, our faith, and our values,” the CatholicVote ad targeting Arizona voters says in Spanish, according to transcripts provided by CatholicVote.",
    "Both Burch and CatholicVote have been vocal in calling out high-profile Catholics like President Joe Biden, whose push for increased access to abortion directly contradicts Catholic teaching on the matter.",
    "“The real priorities of Hispanic voters are being ignored.”\nNeither Kelly nor Masto-Cortez immediately responded to requests for comment from The Daily Wire.",
    "Burch noted that Kelly and Masto-Cortez’s votes in favor of “extreme abortion” are “especially disturbing” in light of their self-professed Catholicism.",
    "The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.",
    "“The Church is clear that support for lethal violence against unborn children is incompatible with Church teaching,” Burch added.",
    "“We Hispanics are proud to be the hardest and most reliable workers in the Nevada economy,” the ad says in Spanish.",
