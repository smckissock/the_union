    "With a crowd of 7855 riding every bump, jump and tackle, Roosters centres Isabelle Kelly and former Dally M winner Jessica Sergis lifted a gear and their hard work on the flanks sent Isabelle Kelly on a charge up the middle to break the deadlock and give the Roosters their first lead of the game.",
    "The Jamie Soward-coached St George-Illawarra side had gone into the decider as firm favourites, their fine form all season capped off on Thursday when Dragons No 1, fullback Emma Tonegato, was awarded the Dally M Medal, a prize she shared with Broncos prop Millie Boyle.",
    "The peer-voted prize, RLPA boss Clint Newton said, was crystallised by Tonegato’s spectacular chase down tackle of Rooster Jess Sergis earlier in the season, a moment voted Tackle of the Year at Dally Ms.\n“It was an NRLW classic moment,” said Newton.",
    "“They may battle it out on the field in Australia’s hardest, most physical and skilful sport, but the players also have huge respect for each other, and every one of the players are essential to the competition’s success.”",
    "Sydney Roosters have won the 2022 NRLW premiership, vanquishing the demons of NRLW grand final losses in 2018 and 2020, to come from behind and defeat St George Illawarra 16-4 at Moreton Daily Stadium in Redcliffe.",
    "But their huge upset victory in the semi, storming back from 16-0 down against reigning premiers and three-time NRLW champions Brisbane Broncos to make the grand final, was a warning the Dragons should’ve heeded.",
    "Close behind was her old rival, Emma Tonegato who capped a remarkable week by running for 206 metres from 24 runs\nIn a consolation prize Tonegato was announced as the NRLW’s Players’ Champion at half-time.",
    "In the shadows of half time, Dragons hooker Keeley Davis looked to have scored a freak try from a deflection from a kick, but the bunker ruled a knock-on in the lead-up to deny the four-pointer.",
    "However Kelly had said in the lead up to the grand final that she was over individual awards and wanted to taste the ultimate success by winning a first NRLW Grand Final with her teammates.",
    "“It left all rugby league fans wanting more; that moment and many others made her an incredibly worthy winner and the RLPA is proud to call her the Players’ Champion,” he said.",
    "In putting the Roosters ahead at the 58-minute mark, Kelly became the first player to pass 2000 run metres, a feat which had never been achieved in the history of the NRLW.",
    "Within minutes of the resumption, the Tricolours were off the canvas when second-rower Yasmin Meakes crashed over from close range to lock up the scores at 4-4.",
    "To salt the wound, Parker copped a shoulder to the head as she fell, resulting in Dragons five-eighth Taliah Fuimaono being sent to the sin bin.",
    "The Dragons’ scramble defence came to the fore again six minutes later when Page McGregor denied Leianne Tufuga in the right hand corner.",
    "And with a first ever try to hooker Olivia Higgins to push the lead out to 16-4, Kelly added NRLW premiership winner to her resume.",
    "With 158 metres, three tackle busts, an offload, a linebreak and eight tackles in the decider, Kelly won Women-of-the-Match.",
    "The Kiwi national, who was suspended in March on a biting charge, crossed in the corner to give the Red V an early 4-0 lead.",
    "It was another jewel in Kelly’s stellar career of Dally M awards, Golden Boots and State of Origin series victories.",
    "Things got worse for the Roosters in the 20th minute when winger Brydie Parker went down with a knee injury.",
    "Bartlett’s eighth four-pointer of the season extended her lead as the record try-scorer in NRLW history.",
    "The underdog Roosters had only scraped into the semi-finals in fourth on points difference.",
    "The Dragons opened the scoring the first time they took possession in the second minute.",
    "Emma Tonegato’s fast catch-and-pass found winger Madison Bartlett on the fly.",
    "It left the Dragons with a slender 4-0 lead at the break."
