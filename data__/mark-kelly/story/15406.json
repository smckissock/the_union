    "Wary of this potential opportunism, Grijalva told the Sentinel that, in addition to advocating for renewable energy development as an alternative to Russian fossil fuel consumption, he is advocating for an addition layer of restrictions, beyond a ban on oil imports from Russia, which would bar any company doing any business with Russia from leasing federal lands for fossil fuel production.",
    "Like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has relentlessly lobbied for NATO and American support in the form of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, Veronika told the Sentinel that she and others in Ukraine hope the international community will help \"close the skies\" over Ukraine to provide cover for Ukrainian military and civil defense soldiers fighting the Russians on the ground.",
    "Still, at the time of his interview with the Sentinel, on March 4 — a day in which the Russian military shelled Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe — Grijalva said the war had not yet reached a point where he would vote to support U.S. military intervention, to include a no-fly zone, if the issue came before Congress.",

    "While Grijalva stressed that he backs the Biden administration's current non-military response to Russia's war in Ukraine, he added a caveat:\n\"If the president reaches a conclusion where he believes the U.S. military is necessary, then take the case to Congress, and for once — in a long time, decades — allow Congress to take that vote.",
    "Khmelnitsky is almost precisely 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Bila Tserkva, and Veronika considered it a miracle — which she attributes to their near-religious adherence to Google Maps course recommendations (others who took other routes did not make it, she observed) — that they made it to the safe house that afternoon.",
    "U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar (R), whose 4th Congressional District covers much of the western and central parts of Arizona, did not respond to written questions submitted to his office by the Sentinel regarding Ukraine's pleas for air support, his views on Putin's nuclear threats, and calls for bans on Russian oil imports.",
