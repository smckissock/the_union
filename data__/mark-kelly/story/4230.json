    "The challenge for the president right now, in looking through some of the polls that have come out in these last few days marking the year anniversary of his presidency, is that voters have essentially lost confidence, not in his ability to be effective on certain issues, but they have lost confidence in him to actually do his job effectively, to actually be an effective president on issues like being a good commander in chief or being able to do a good job handling a crisis.",
    "And so President Biden is probably going to keep calling senators, but the White House is now insisting they are not going to tell us about every conversation, in hopes that, if they don't talk about it, if you don't talk about Bruno, you don't talk about the calls to the senators, then maybe people will pay attention to something else.",
    "I find myself in a situation where I don't get a chance to look people in the eye, because of both COVID and things that are happening in Washington, to be able to go out and do the things that I've always been able to do pretty well, connect with people, let them take a measure of my sincerity, let them take a measure of who I am.",
    "Amy Walter:\nSo, in talking to Democrats up next year myself and then watching this weekend Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, who's in a very competitive district outside of Detroit, what they will tell you is, we need something tangible, just one or two things for the president to focus on that we can pass.",
    "NPR’s Tamara Keith and Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter join Judy Woodruff to discuss the latest political news, including the censure of Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the president’s hot mic moment from a White House presser, and voter confidence in the Biden administration.",
    "But, to Tam's point, the parties now have become really just about what the activist basis wants, much more than whether or not this is the kind of candidate who can win in that state, number one, and a candidate who can deliver for the state on the most important issues to people there.",
    "But I do want to bring up something that — in fact, first, I was going to ask you about something President Biden said at his news conference last week about a change in approach, but I have to bring you a little bit of breaking news from the White House this afternoon.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nWell, speaking of convincing voters, one of the things the president spoke about, talked about in that news conference last week that went on for almost two hours was talking about how he hopes next — this year to get out and connect more with voters.",
    "Read the Full Transcript\nJudy Woodruff:\nAfter Senate Democrats were unable last week to change the Senate rule the filibuster to make it possible to pass voting rights legislation, Arizona's state Democratic Party censured Senator Kyrsten Sinema.",
    "But this White House also realizes that the last three months or so have been completely consumed by negotiating with Democrats, negotiating with their own party in Congress, trying to get legislation done that they haven't yet gotten done.",
    "Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:\nWell, Judy, that's a great question, because I think there is a cost, in some cases, for the party, and there is also a cost for the way that Congress works, or, in this case, doesn't work very well.",
    "And there has been a widespread perception among voters expressed through polls and focus groups that the president isn't talking about the things that they care about most, because they were so focused on these legislative negotiations.",
    "By the way, Arizona is also a state that has censured three of its last four Senate candidates — or members of the United States Senate, not Mark Kelly, but two Republicans, and then, of course, Sinema.",
    "The critique that the Biden White House is trying to respond to that has come through in focus groups from voters is that the president is not directly addressing the issues they care about most enough.",
    "Make it something that voters understand and that it relates to their lives, whether it's about child care, prescription drugs, were the two things that Congresswoman Slotkin pointed to.",
    "To help us make sense of this and other news brewing in politics, I'm joined by our Politics Monday duo, Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR.",
    "But President Biden said right before that, I don't want to answer a bunch of questions about Russia because I don't want to distract from this event that I'm doing about inflation.",
    "And now Sinema — Senator Sinema being censured by her party, the Arizona Democratic leadership in that party believes that voting rights is one of the existential issues.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nTam, so does the White House think — I mean, is it thought that getting out more, talking to voters could make a difference in how the president is seen?",
    "And, also, I think you're going to hear some frustration, especially in conservative circles, that, look, President Trump said bad things about the press all the time.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nSo, I don't know if you could hear the whole thing, but Peter Doocy was asking if inflation — the fact that inflation keeps going up is an asset.",
    "Tamara Keith:\nEvery president believes that, if they could just get out and talk to voters more, give more speeches, they could convince them.",
    "And former vice president, then Vice President Joe Biden, also had a hot mic moment with an even naught naughtier word when Obamacare passed.",
    "And I guess, as the room — as the press was leaving, FOX News reporter Peter Doocy asked the president — a question about inflation.",
    "And, certainly, the state parties, whether it be Republican or Democrat, that is where you're going to find the activists.",
    "The last three elections there for senator, John McCain, Kyrsten Sinema, Mark Kelly this last year, they all narrowly won.",
    "She, along with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, made up the only two Democratic holdouts on that major vote.",
    "This is following a behavior that the then-candidate and newly elected President Biden said he wouldn't engage in.",
    "In particular, Republicans who voted to impeach former President Trump have been targeted by their state parties.",
    "The move in Arizona is part of a growing trend of political parties taking on their own members over key issues.",
    "Then he has this hot mic moment that is absolutely going to distract from the event he is doing about inflation.",
    "In other words, they got voters to cross over and support them who didn't support the presidential candidate.",
    "So I think, again, lowering the temperature was supposed to be his calling card and unifying the country.",
    "President Joe Biden:\nPart of the problem is, as well, I have not been out in the community nearly enough.",
    "We had Donald Trump narrowly win there in 2016, and, in 2020, Joe Biden narrowly wins in that state.",
    "The Republicans have been going after their members who voted to impeach former President Trump.",
    "Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:\nYes, as you say, this is primarily been a Republican trend.",
    "They're the people who are volunteering their time and being part of these state parties.",
    "You could also get a voter who voted for Hillary Clinton, but also voted for John McCain.",
    "President Biden was meeting — having a meeting the East Room talking about the economy.",
    "Tam, I'm reminded of Ronald Reagan, \"We're going to start bombing in five minutes.\"",

    "Judy Woodruff:\nAmy, is there a cost to the parties for doing this?",
    "The state, you win by attracting independent and crossover voters.",
    "This is one of those \"I didn't know I was on live mic\" moments.",
    "The White House has tried to remedy, including with this event.",
    "Every — I think every president, every politician has done it.",
    "He's got to show an ability to get some wins on those fronts.",
    "I'm told that Peter Doocy laughed it off on the air later.",
    "So it is completely out of step with where the state is.",
    "He's dropped significantly among voters on those issues.",
    "That's what they're desperate to see of this president.",
    "And now we're talking about Peter Doocy and a bad word.",
    "So I don't know that it is particularly good politics.",
    "It is starting — as we said, starting to be a trend.",
    "What do these kinds of moves say about the parties?",
    "(LAUGHTER)\nAmy Walter:\nNo, I agree with that.",
    "So, you would get a Trump and a Kelly voter.",
    "Arizona is a great example of this, right?",
    "I'm not sure that is where this is headed.",

    "And you heard the president's answer.",
    "And they are expressing frustration.",
    "That is the most active activists.",
    "Does it end up strengthening them?",
    "And so they are censuring her.",
    "I've been here an awful lot.",
    "Let's pick up on this, Tam.",
    "I mean, what are we seeing?",
    "It is a true purple state.",
    "Do they end up healing?",
    "How has it worked out?",
    "This is a 50/50 state.",
