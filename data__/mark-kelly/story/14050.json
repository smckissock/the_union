    "Last week, Vice President Harris expressed support for a war crimes investigation into Russia and said when asked if the country’s actions in Ukraine constitute war crimes, “We have been clear that any intentional attack or targeting of civilians is a war crime.",
    "But we need to go through the legal assessment and review in order to make a formal conclusion.”\nIn an address to Congress on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showed a video of the destruction the war has caused in Ukraine.",
    "Period.”\nResponding to a question about Harris’s support for such an investigation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there is a legal review process to make considerations before labeling an action as a war crime.",
    "Biden has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and announced multiple rounds of sanctions against Moscow, but he has refrained from commenting on whether the Kremlin has committed war crimes in the conflict.",

    "Kelly’s comments come after the Senate on Tuesday passed a nonbinding resolution supporting a war crimes investigation into Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.",
    "He is attacking hospitals, maternity wards, apartment buildings.”\n“When you direct fire on civilians, by definition you are a war criminal,” he added.",
    "More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the fighting began roughly three weeks ago, according to the U.N.",
    "The Hill has removed its comment section, as there are many other forums for readers to participate in the conversation.",
    "The video showed civilian buildings being hit with bombs and missiles as well as injured and dead Ukrainians.",
    "Kelly was asked by a CNN reporter on Wednesday if President Biden should call Putin a war criminal.",
    "“Obviously, if Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime.",
    "“That is the ongoing process that … we’re pursuing at this point in time.",
    "We invite you to join the discussion on Facebook and Twitter.",
