    "The GOP-controlled Senate Leadership Fund is reserving eight-figure ad flights starting in September to protect Republican seats in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as well as to take Democratic-held seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, the group told POLITICO.",
    "Some Republicans are feeling less and less sure about how competitive they will be in the Granite State, but Law said he feels “very confident that we will end up playing in New Hampshire.” In the interim, Republicans and Democrats alike are concentrating elsewhere.",

    "If things go Republicans’ way, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) could be beatable in November, and Law didn’t rule out spending in Washington state, where Tiffany Smiley is challenging a heavily favored Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).",
    "The GOP’s Senate Leadership Fund reserved in just six states to start the 2020 battle for Senate control while the Democrats’ Senate Majority PAC reserved in five; both groups doubled their footprint as races evolved.",
    "By reserving fall airtime in the spring, the groups can lock in lower prices than they would pay later in the year, especially in media markets like Nevada that have competitive races for governor and Congress.",

    "But beating incumbents is always hard, and Democratic senators are generally raising eye-popping sums like Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock’s $13.6 million in the first quarter of this year.",
    "Taken together, the two primary outside groups in Senate races have slotted nearly a quarter-billion dollars for the fall, with much more spending to follow those initial commitments.",
    "“And, you know, in several of these races … the Democratic incumbent is smart and well funded, and has a pathway to hold under their seat.”\nAt the moment, the Senate map looks tight.",
    "Total spending during this year’s midterm is unlikely to rival 2020’s in the end, especially since the Georgia runoffs and the presidential race increased costs for Senate campaigns.",
    "On the other hand, a Democratic recovery at the polls could make that party more bullish about North Carolina or make Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) reelection race tougher.",
    "“The only thing that ever concerns me when you’re in an environment that’s this good, and there’s so much talk about the red wave, is that complacency sets in,” Law said.",
    "I mean, there’s so much at stake.”\nNotably, neither super PAC is putting money yet in New Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is running for reelection.",
    "And among those primaries, Republicans have more contested battles than Democrats — sparking some fear in the GOP that bad candidates could blow winnable races.",

    "“Both parties recognize the core 2022 Senate map as competitive races in several ‘built to be close’ presidential battleground states.",
    "With Republicans currently favored to take the House, the 50-50 Senate is shaping up to be this fall’s marquee electoral contest.",
    "“The only place where there’s a candidate who could possibly lose a perfectly winnable race would be Eric Greitens, in Missouri.",
    "The GOP carries the burden of bad candidates and a badly damaged brand,” said JB Poersch, the president of Senate Majority PAC.",
