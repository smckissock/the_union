    "But two trends since our last survey in December are hurting President Biden and his party: waning intention to vote in the midterms and a new GOP advantage on which party is better for the economy.",
    "And you’ll hear what they care about.”\nThere have been a series of reports this year suggesting that the GOP is gaining ground with Latino voters, not just in Florida but in Texas as well.",
    "That’s notable given that earlier in his presidency, Biden was doing significantly better among Hispanics relative to how he was doing overall and compared with how he did in 2020.",
