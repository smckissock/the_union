    "Chris Hartline, a spokesman for the Senate GOP campaign organization, said the Senate contest in Arizona is still competitive.",
    "Trump has lashed out at Ducey repeatedly for refusing to support Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election.",
    "“We have great candidates running in Arizona, one of whom will beat Mark Kelly in November,” he said.",
    "Ducey also notified donors of his decision in a letter, as first reported by The Arizona Republic.",
    "With Ducey out of the race, it’s unclear whether Trump will endorse before primary election.",
