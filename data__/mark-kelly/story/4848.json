    "Here's where the GOP's Senate Leadership Fund has planned its initial investments:\nGeorgia (offense): $37 million\nNorth Carolina (defense): $27 million\nPennsylvania (defense): $24 million\nNevada (offense): $15 million\nWisconsin (defense): $15 million\nArizona (offense): $14 million\nAlaska (defense): $7.4 million\nThis is a short blurb about Daily Kos.",
    "And if fundraising is any measure, Senate Democrats have a fighting chance in November, with their four most vulnerable senators—Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire—all surpassing the hauls of their leading GOP challengers.",
    "Take the PAC's heaviest commitment of $37 million in Georgia, where Republicans have one of their best pickup chances but are saddled with alleged wife abuser Herschel Walker, who has written about his struggles with violent episodes partially fueled by his multiple personalities.",
    "The Senate Leadership Fund's $141 million ad buy outpaces the Democratic Senate Majority PAC's early investment of $106 million by some $35 million, but it's not exactly a show of strength despite what the head of the Republican super PAC would have us believe.",
    "Law admitted as much, saying Democratic candidates' advantages in fundraising nearly across the board necessitated the Senate GOP super PAC to “try to level that playing field.”\nEven so, Law insists Senate Republicans are still huge favorites this fall.",
    "So Senate Republicans’ brightest pickup hope maintains a couple-point edge in polling, but he’s carrying a load of personal baggage and is being significantly outraised by his opponent.",
    "Walker reported strong Q1 fundraising of $5.5 million, but it pales in comparison to the whopping $13.6 million raised by Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.",
    "A super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made a record-breaking amount of ad reservations, mostly starting in August, for the 2022 midterm election.",
    "“The only thing that ever concerns me when you’re in an environment that’s this good, and there’s so much talk about the red wave, is that complacency sets in,” Law said.",
    "Listen and subscribe to Daily Kos Elections’ The Downballot podcast with David Nir and David Beard\nx\nx\nYou need to enable JavaScript to run this app.",
    "“This is such a strong year that we need to invest as broadly and deeply as we can,” Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law told Politico.",
    "However, both the McConnell- and Schumer-aligned super PACs will surely pour additional funds into the races depending on how they take shape.",
    "All that context puts a slightly different spin on the GOP's heavy investment in Georgia from show of strength to sign of concern.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "We are primarily accountable to readers like you because donations from readers like you are our biggest source of income.",
    "Interestingly, Hassan didn't make the Leadership Fund's top target list after the GOP failed to recruit New Hampshire Gov.",
    "But the president of Democrats' Senate Majority PAC had a different take on the hefty Republican spending in 2022.",
    "\"The GOP carries the burden of bad candidates and a badly damaged brand,\" noted JB Poersch.",
    "That's not just journalists, but fact-checkers, editors, and administrative staff.",
    "We don't have corporate backers that are only in it for the bottom line.",
    "It's important:\n Media outlets shed 28,637 jobs last year alone.",
