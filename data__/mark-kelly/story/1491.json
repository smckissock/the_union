    "On Monday, 17 Senate Republicans signed a letter with 17 Senate Democrats that urges Biden to “release the maximum allowable number of additional” H-2B foreign visa workers to inflate the labor market despite more than 12 million Americans remaining jobless, though all want full-time employment.",

    "Another 3.7 million Americans are underemployed — that is, holding part-time jobs while wanting full-time work.",
    "Ignore businesses reliant on cheap foreign labor and listen to voters — it’s that simple,” he said."
