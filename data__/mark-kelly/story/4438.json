    "There were moments of strong words and pointed emotion, as well as occasional exchanges between members of opposite parties that resembled the sort of bygone, freewheeling debates that many senators say should be a more routine feature of an institution that was once deemed, in seriousness that has evolved into sarcasm, the “world’s greatest deliberative body.”\nIn one notable speech, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., accused Democrats of peddling a “negative, false narrative of what is happening to America” by referring to the new state laws as “Jim Crow 2.0” and making comparisons to the depravities suffered by Black Americans before and during the civil rights era.",

    "“These radicals on the other side, to get their own way, are prepared to break the United States Senate by taking steps almost all of them decried as recently as a couple of years ago.”\nThe final push for action has included a major Atlanta address last week from Biden, a former six-term senator, who threw his support behind changing the filibuster after concluding, he said, that democracy was at critical risk.",
    "“As I keep hearing the references to Jim Crow, I ask myself how many Americans understand what Jim Crow was,” said Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, calling the comparison “offensive not just to me or Southern Americans, but offensive to millions of Americans who fought, bled and died for the right to vote.”\nThat drew a response from Cory Booker.",
    "Manchin, meanwhile, insisted the Democratic proposal amounted to an attempt to “break the rules to change the rules.”\nManchin added that Democrats could opt to keep the voting rights legislation on the Senate floor for days or weeks longer, working to invite amendments and build GOP support that has been elusive over months of back-channel negotiations.",
    "“I've been engaged a long time in public policy, and I don’t know many things that have been done in one fell swoop,” he said, adding, “I think you're going to see the people [Republicans] would try to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to be made in order to change the law back to what it should be.",

    "“We’re called the United States, not the divided states, and putting politics and party aside is what we’re supposed to do.”\nSinema did not speak on the floor Wednesday, but she made her position clear in a speech last week, delivered just before Biden arrived on Capitol Hill to lobby Democrats at a private Senate lunch.",

    "But Manchin and Sinema have resisted a blitz of political pressure from political organizations, civil rights groups and their own colleagues, who have all made the case that the threat to democracy posed by a spate of Republican-passed state voting restrictions outweighs the need to preserve the filibuster.",
