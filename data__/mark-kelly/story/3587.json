    "POLITICO Playbook: Ominous signs for Ukraine\nBy RYAN LIZZA, RACHAEL BADE and EUGENE DANIELS\n01/26/2022 06:19 AM EST\nPresented by\nDRIVING THE DAY\nUKRAINE LATEST — Tuesday saw a flurry of activity in Washington, Moscow and Brussels, but little clarity as to whether Europe was closer to a war — one that President JOE BIDEN warned would be “the largest invasion since World War II” and “would change the world.”\nLet’s start with this bit of reconnaissance about the latest Russian military moves deep in WaPo’s Ukraine ledeall:\n“Analysts from the Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent Russian open-source investigative outfit that monitors Russia’s military, reported Tuesday the first confirmed video of Russian paratroopers moving closer to Ukraine, calling the development ‘ominous’ because it follows the movement of Russian military groups into Belarus, north of Kyiv.” More from their Twitter feed\nOther ominous signs:\n—WaPo: Russia announced new military exercises “involving thousands of troops, tanks, elite paratroopers and short-range ballistic missiles” that “are intended to project strength, keep Moscow’s foes off balance and intensify pressure on NATO and Ukraine …\n“The Russian Defense Ministry also announced the arrival of Pacific Fleet forces in Belarus ahead of a major military exercise with that country next month, further fueling Western alarm over a possible invasion of Ukraine.”\n— Biden, speaking to reporters, elaborated on recently announced plans to boost defenses of NATO countries in Eastern Europe: “I may be moving some of those troops in the nearer term, just because it takes time.”\n— In Moscow, President VLADIMIR PUTIN’s longtime spokesman, DMITRY PESKOV, said putting those NATO troops on high alert was “building up tension” and that Russia was “observing these actions of the United States with profound concern.”\n— Outside Kyiv, KRISTINA KVIEN, America’s top official in the country, posed alongside a shipment of U.S.-made missiles and other weaponry and declared, “Let me underscore that Russian soldiers sent to Ukraine at the behest of the Kremlin will face fierce resistance.",
