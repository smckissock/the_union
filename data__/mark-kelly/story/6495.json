    "But there are credible reasons to believe the so-called Bucha Massacre was not the doing of the Russian Forces, but rather of the Ukrainians—either local militia or SBU or some combination of thereof—as part of brutal reprisals against “saboteurs” and “Russian collaborators.”\nComments:\nRoach mentions what I had noticed: The mayor of Bucha celebrated its liberation on March 30 without any mention of murdered civilians in the streets.",
    "From another report we are told that temporary burial in mass graves is done during wartime because burial in individual graves is too dangerous.",
    "It was difficult to believe that the bodies showin in the street days after the Russians had left showed no signs of decomposition.",
    "(snip)If civilians were shot and purposefully killed in Bucha, it undoubtedly would be a war crime and a terrible thing.",
    "For example, to determine whether a war crime took place we must know who did the killing, why, and how.",
    "The reports and photographs showing an apparent massacre in Bucha, Ukraine, are truly terrible.",
    "(snip)Of course, pictures do not always tell the whole story.",
    "Bindings used on hands were pristine clean white.",
    "We didn’t hear of that until several days later.",
    "Things that create doubts."
