pull off the biggest comeback win in Australian rugby league history.",
    "Cronulla’s Ronaldo Mulitalo piled on the first-half pain for Manly with more great finishing.Credit:Getty\nDes Hasler’s forwards crisis only worsened on a windy night in the Shire, Taniela Paseka limping off with a serious knee (MCL) injury, Dylan Walker (knee) and Andrew Davey (shoulder) also failing to finish the match, while Haumole Olakau’atu will come under match review scrutiny for a high shot on Aiden Tolman.",
    "That can’t happen.”\nCRONULLA SHARKS 34 (Siosifa Talakai 2, Ronaldo Mulitalo 2, Will Kennedy, Teig Wilton tries; Nicho Hynes 5 goals) defeated MANLY SEA EAGLES 22 (Christian Tuipulotu, Taniela Paseka, Lachlan Croker, Haumole Olakau’atu tries; Reuben Garrick 3 goals) at PointsBet Stadium.",
    "Talakai, who was on the verge of quitting the NRL only four years ago after being sacked by South Sydney for contract breaches, tortured Des Hasler’s side with two tries and three try assists in a mesmerising first half as Cronulla avoided butchering a 32-point lead on Thursday night.",
    "Fittler sat on the sideline only metres away from Talakai during his swashbuckling performance as the Sharks held on for a 34-22 win at PointsBet Stadium with every point - bar a last-minute Nicho Hynes penalty goal - scored down the northern end of the field.",
    "Manly’s amazing record against the Sharks - they had won 18 of their past 21 meetings stretching back to 2008 - took all of 10 seconds to be under threat when Cherry-Evans misjudged the kick-off in the howling southerly wind and was trapped in his own in-goal.",
    "Manly do not stop.”\nHaving had to resurrect his career first through Newtown in the NSW Cup, and then on a train-and-trial deal with the Sharks, Talakai wasn’t even meant to play centre for Cronulla, and certainly not this early in the season.",
    "The makeshift centre, who celebrated his 25th birthday earlier this week, is eligible for both State of Origin and Tonga, who are likely to have a mid-season Test against New Zealand on the same weekend as game two of the interstate series.",
    "It will force Talakai into a decision over his representative eligibility with Latrell Mitchell, a walk-up start for Brad Fittler NSW’s side at left centre, in severe doubt for the Origin series opener with a hamstring injury.",

    "The Sea Eagles went on a three-try blitz within nine second-half minutes, including close-range efforts from Paseka and Lachlan Croker, and had all the momentum when Olakau’atu scored off a Daly Cherry-Evans pass.",
    "“I was also feeling a little bit uncomfortable about our physical presence - our skill execution was at a really high level - but I thought Manly were having a real crack at us physically despite the scoreboard.",
    "It would be hard to say that he doesn’t [stay at centre].”\nBut Manly trimmed the margin to just 10 points with 15 minutes remaining before the Sharks steadied to consolidate their top-four spot.",
    "Cronulla centre Siosifa Talakai scores one of his two first-half tries against Manly.Credit:Getty\n“In hindsight, and it’s a wonderful thing, the COVID underdid [Harper] a bit,” Hasler said.",
    "But by then the damage had been done with Talakai scoring twice in the first 15 minutes of the game and then showing sleight of hand to set up Ronaldo Multialo’s first-half double.",
    "Talakai tortured Manly opposite Morgan Harper in a blistering first 40 minutes, so much so Hasler benched his centre at the break as Cronulla led 32-0.",
    "Fitzgibbon will be far from pleased with his side’s second-half effort into the wind, with fullback Will Kennedy (shoulder) also leaving the field.",
    "But with recent injuries to Connor Tracey and Matt Ikuvalu, coach Craig Fitzgibbon has switched the 100kg dynamo out wide with devastating effect.",
    "He’ll fix himself up and dust himself down.”\nSaid Fitzgibbon: “[Talakai] is just a humble guy working hard at his game.",
    "And if that wasn’t enough he deftly kicked off the outside of his right boot after a long break for Kennedy to score.",
    "Referee Gerard Sutton sin-binned Oalakau’atu for the tackle despite the Sharks scoring on a subsequent play.",
