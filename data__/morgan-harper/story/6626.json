    "On Thursday night, dozens of Republican leaders in Ohio – including Columbiana County Republican Party chairman David Johnson – mounted a last-minute effort to urge Trump not to endorse Vance following a news report that said Trump had made a decision and was planning to go with Vance.",
    "While Gibbons and Mandel had been leading in recent polls, officials backing various candidates had long conceded that Trump’s coveted support would likely push his pick to the front of the pack in a race that has revolved, to a large extent, around him.",
    "But Vance, in particular, has also come under fire for old audio and since-deleted tweets in which he called himself a “never-Trump guy,” called Trump an idiot, and said he might have to hold his nose and vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.",
    "In the race, he has closely aligned himself with the former president, making frequent appearances on Fox News and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s podcast, where he has echoed Trump’s rhetoric on issues including immigration.",
