    "PA GOP SENATE BATTLE: DAVID MCCORMICK RETURNS FIRE, CALLS ON DR. OZ TO ‘RENOUNCE’ TURKISH CITIZENSHIP\nLast month, a campaign spokesperson said that \"voters of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have a right to ask why Cleveland, Ohio-born Mehmet Oz won’t renounce his Turkish citizenship and why he chose to serve in the Turkish military over America’s military.\"",
    "Oz, who as a dual citizen is legally permitted to serve in Congress, had previously indicated he had no intention of renouncing his Turkish citizenship, which he has maintained in order to take care of his mother, who lives in Istanbul and suffers from Alzheimer’s.",
    "FOX NEWS POLL: MCCORMICK TOPS DR. OZ IN PENNSYLVANIA GOP SENATE PRIMARY POLL\nHowever, McCormick’s lead is not rock solid: only 22% of his backers are certain they will support him at the ballot box, while 77% may change their mind.",
    "DR. OZ SAYS COVID-19 'STEELED' HIM TO RUN FOR OFFICE, CALLS ON FAUCI TO RESIGN\nMeanwhile, a Fox News survey of Pennsylvania GOP primary voters earlier this month found that McCormick tops Oz by 9 points (24%-15%).",
    "(McCormick Senate campaign)\n\"The bigoted attacks my opponent Dave McCormick has made against me as the child of immigrants are reminiscent of slurs made in the past about Catholics and Jews,\" Oz told Fox News.",

    "EXCLUSIVE: Dr. Mehmet Oz on Wednesday told Fox News that if he is elected to the U.S. Senate to represent Pennsylvania, he will renounce his Turkish citizenship before being sworn into office.",
    "(Tristan Wheelock/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nPennsylvania is one of the key Senate races in the 2022 midterm election cycle that will decide control of the upper chamber.",
    "\"I maintained it to care for my ailing mother, but after several weeks of discussions with my family, I’m committing that before I am sworn in as the next U.S.",
    "The candidates are all vying for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in the battleground state.",

    "Oz added: \"It is completely disqualifying behavior for anyone aiming to serve in the United States Senate.\"",
    "\"It is a sign of McCormick’s desperate campaign that he has resorted to this disgraceful tactic.\"",
    "McCormick, on the campaign trail, has called on Oz to renounce his dual citizenship with Turkey.",
    "\"My dual citizenship has become a distraction in this campaign,\" Oz told Fox News Wednesday.",
    "Nearly one-third (31%) are unsure which candidate they will support in the May 17 primary.",
    "Nearly twice as many Oz supporters, 40%, feel sure to back him (59% could change).",
    "Voters can’t trust Mehmet Oz,\" McCormick said in comments Wednesday to Fox News.",
