    "Towering over the small two- and three-story row homes, which had once been the tallest thing in the neighborhood besides the modest manufacturing warehouses that employed thousands of blue-collar residents, the premium housing structure will cover more than 60,000 square feet of retail space to accommodate an Amazon Fresh grocery.",
    "One station in Kensington got so bad the city simply closed up its gates, the Inquirer reported, to try to catch up on the “damage caused by urination, human waste, discarded needles, and other debris.”\nAt the bottom of the steel steps at the El stop, I saw five people counting the change out of a white styrofoam cup.",
    "Violence and shootings are creeping closer into Northern Liberties from the impoverished areas to its west, while the neighborhood of Kensington, home to the largest open-air drug market in the United States, and a festering wound in the national opioid epidemic, sits several blocks north.",
    "The Piazza’s Alta building is perhaps the gem of the project, with both penthouse and standard units (two-bedroom floorplans start at $5,695 a month) that offer tilt-and-turn picture windows to emphasize the natural light through the variety of Scandinavian, sleek, and classic interiors.",
    "At Fifth and Spring Garden, a couple of blocks south of my old apartment, where I’d once take my two-year-old for challah French toast at the breakfast spot around the corner, the strip of restaurants, as well as my old gym, had been razed and surrounded by fences.",
    "Back in Northern Liberties, I stop by the Piazza, the most ambitious development project in the neighborhood, which extends over several structures on a 1.1-million-square-foot complex with 1,131 premium dwellings in various stages of loud and messy construction.",
    "On my way out, I walk by a new health spa on Second Street offering March specials (two packs of Botox cheek filler syringes just $1,100) and head to grab a cup of coffee with a friend who still lives in his place down the street from my old apartment.",
    "Last year, the Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro estimated the neighborhood’s drug market is “approaching a billion-dollar enterprise,” with drug corners worth $60,000 a day and some premium blocks earning the dealers a cool million per week.",
    "Mayhem may rule the streets seen off in the distance in Kensington, but that might as well be in another country from up on the rooftop pool, where a 20,000-square-foot water surface designed in the fashion of an ancient ruin flows serenely.",
    "Nothing like the shooting, he told me, though in the morning, as it happened, he’d had several packages stolen off his porch, supplies for a long-planned, fast-approaching vacation that were snagged by a thief before he could get them.",
    "“The laws that govern drug sales, use, and acceptable behaviors on streets, in park spaces, and even on private property in the rest of Philadelphia very purposefully do not apply here,” a longtime Kensington resident wrote recently.",
    "Not long after I moved away, he and his wife had been driving back from picking up their daughter at school in the middle of the afternoon when they slammed on the brakes and ducked for cover, as a shooting was taking place.",
    "A block up, a woman walked past me, and I overheard her say to her companion, “He was 13 months sober, what else could I have done?” To describe what has happened to Kensington is to speak in terms of the apocalyptic.",
    "The construction on a 105,000-square-foot development was well underway, with the machines pushing dirt underneath the giant crane carrying the pieces of what will become 382 high-end units in a 13-story building.",
    "Their clothes were ragged, one was barefoot, and their movements as they thumbed the coins in their hands were exaggerated and slow, in the way of opioid users who have to lug around the weight of their habits.",
    "“Here on the block where I live with my wife, drug dealers herd people deep in the throes of addiction like cattle toward the promise of a small amount of free drugs, in hopes that they’ll come back for more.",
    "Police labor shortages, high law enforcement resignation rates, and the rapid uptick in violent crime had made it increasingly difficult for the public transportation authority, SEPTA, to police the trains.",

    "In Kensington, many residents lack a high school degree, and the median income hovers below $17,000.",
    "Still, I wondered if my friend had seen any uptick over the past several months.",
    "But at least he’ll get a week outside of the city.",
    "They gather 50 people or more at a time.",
    "“What can you do?” I said to him.",
    "“Not much,” he replied."
