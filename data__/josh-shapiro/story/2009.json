    "“East Goshen will be grateful for the opportunity to put that money to good use, to help save or support some of our residents who have to succumb to opioid addiction, whether through the use of Narcan in the hands of first responders, or support programs for the addicted resident or their family members.”\nTredyffrin Township Manager William Martin said last week that his board would also retroactively join in the settlement after he had notified the Attorney general’s Office that the township would agree to it.",
    "While no dollar amount will bring back what we have lost, this settlement was negotiated to allocate funding to states and local communities who have been most impacted by this crisis and will provide more resources for treatment than any previous settlement.”\nIn the county, the settlement came with the aid of 14 of its 15 municipalities with populations of 10,000 or more, with the sole exception of West Chester.",
    "“Knowing the drugs they were manufacturing could become addictive so quickly, even when used ‘as directed, by a physician,’ these companies have created an epidemic of massive proportions, permeating every race and economic class, reaching into almost every family in some insidious manner,” said Truitt, whose board formally approved the settlement on Wednesday, even as it had signed on before the deadline.",
    "On Jan. 27, Shapiro announced that as of the state’s deadline, all 67 counties, including 241 local governments with a population of 10,000 or more, had joined the $26 billion opioid agreement with the nation’s three major pharmaceutical distributors — Cardinal, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen — and Johnson & Johnson over the companies’ role in creating and fueling the nationwide opioid crisis.",
    "“I’ve seen this as a really big problem, but I think the settlement is going to be an excellent opportunity for us.”\nKichline said department heads Pat Bokovitch of the county’s Department of Human Services and Vince Brown of the Department of Drug and Alcohol Services were working together to come up with a set of plans for avenues the county will fund through the settlement.",
    "“Considering the severity of the opioid epidemic in the US, our county, and yes, even here in East Goshen Township, it is past time for drug companies to give us compensation to use on tools to combat this vile addiction they, the drug companies, inflicted upon all of us,” said East Goshen supervisors Chairwoman Michelle Truitt in a statement.",
    "“The increase in funding means more for the issues that we are prioritizing,” to help prevent and treat the effects of the addiction that had led to death and life devastation across the county in the years since drugs like Oxycontin began to be distributed by the medical profession without regard to their harmful impact.",
    "WEST CHESTER — When Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced last month that all the state’s counties signed on to the massive, historic settlement of opioid litigation that will bring more than $1 billion for drug treatment and prevention, there was additionally good news for Chester County.",
    "“There was no reason not to sign on.”\nMichael Stefano, president of West Chester Borough Council, on Saturday said that his colleagues had decided not to join the settlement at present, although they were advised by the borough solicitor that it could do so in the future if council members reconsidered.",
    "“With this landmark support, Pennsylvania is on track to receive the full $1.07 billion, with funding beginning to flow into our communities as early as April to jumpstart programs and ramp up staffing to save the lives of those struggling with opioid addiction,” he said in a statement.",
    "The funds that the county receives will not be allocated on a municipality-by-municipality basis but will be distributed to schools, ambulance and police departments, and non-profit treatment centers as need be, said Kichline.",
    "“We are always happy to get more money,” said Commissioner Michelle Kichline, whose efforts to combat the opioid addiction epidemic began several years ago and spearheaded the move to join the litigation.",
    "These include in-school prevention and education programs, additional resources for first responders and police, and expanded treatment options for those suffering from addiction.",
    "Instead of the $15.5 million the county commissioners had announced the settlement would bring in for such programs, the settlement details showed the county receiving even more.",
    "“This agreement marks the most significant influx of resources to our Commonwealth to address this epidemic, jet-fueled by greedy pharmaceutical companies.",
    "The latest figure of $19.2 million is based on the percentage allocation of the entire “pot,” with the county’s percentage allocation set at 2.28 percent.",
    "“Our work here is not done — this settlement is only with three distributors and Johnson & Johnson,” added Shapiro, who is now running for governor.",
    "“At this point, the council felt we didn’t have enough information, and somehow the deal did sound like the best for us,” he said in an interview.",
    "The county’s share compares with $48.7 million going to Delaware County, $45.5 million to Bucks County, and $35.1 million to Montgomery County.",
    "The $19.2 million will be distributed to the county over a nine-year period, with the first disbursement expected to come in April.",
    "Asked what the council had hoped to have included in the settlement, he demurred, saying it involved possible future litigation.",
    "“It’s something I am going to be working very closely on, to get innovative solutions,” Kichline said in an interview Thursday.",
    "“It makes sense for us, and I discussed it with (Police Chief Michael Beatty, who encouraged the township to act),” he said.",
    "“There are more companies and more executives who will pay for what was done in Pennsylvania.",
    "As the “pot” goes up, so too does the county’s allocation.",
    "“We weren’t looking for anything (specific),” he said.",
    "But he could detail specifics of why."
