    "He’s started to refer to those voters he wants Democrats to focus on—people who feel like the Republican Party has abandoned their values around upholding the Constitution—as the “Bush-Cheney coalition.” It’s a reference to the former vice president who served under both Bushes, as well as Dick Cheney’s daughter, Liz, the Wyoming Republican congresswoman who is calling out the former president’s lies about a stolen election and is serving on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.",
    "We’ve just never seen this level of vulgarity after an election — and so long after the election at that.”\n“In a civilized society,” she added, “we just don’t do that.”\nBarrels of ink have been spilled over the past seven years examining Donald Trump’s appeal in rural places like Clearfield County, an old timber and coal region situated along Interstate 80 on the western edge of central Pennsylvania.",
    "“I read history, and I don’t think we’re immune from what happened before where people have been swayed by somebody that was a strong authoritarian figure.”\nSeveral weeks after I left DuBois—after Vladimir Putin had invaded Ukraine and the world, led by the United States, had united in outrage—I reached out to Parker to ask her thoughts on Biden’s State of the Union speech.",
    "“And she said, ‘I just came to tell you I had to take my Biden sign down because I was too afraid.’”\nBack home in the Foulkrods’ TV room, surrounded by 18 snowy acres that once included a family-run Christmas tree and shrubbery nursery, Frank told me he’s mostly pleased with the job Biden and Democrats are doing in Washington considering the challenges.",
    "“You’re actually destroying our country.”\n“When Trump was elected the first time, I think everybody was excited for that change,” says Kulbacki, a longtime Republican and gun-rights supporter who says she’s been souring on Trump of late, mostly over the destabilizing actions he took during the second half of his term and after losing two years ago.",
    "As he pilots us through the backroads around DuBois, Kathy tells me about the time she was shopping at a crafts store when she stumbled into an aisle display where someone had used big, block letters to spell out “T-R-U-M-P.” She flagged it for a store employee, who she says assured her it wasn’t constructed by anyone working there.",
    "Their stories often mirror one another: a feeling that they’re viewed as social outcasts; an acknowledgement—and in certain instances alarm—that they no longer understand the motivations of people who live around them; hyperpartisanship infecting everyday routines, spreading from home to home, and deepening the mistrust in town.",
    "“Don’t blame me,” says another sign attached to a house, “I voted for Trump.”\nJust as much as the diner-going, flag-raising Trump voters foretold the surprising rise and staying power of Trump’s populist revolt, conversations with beleaguered rural Democrats provide clues about the persistent decline of their party’s influence.",
    "Beverly Lindemuth, who lives in Hazen in Jefferson County, about 20 minutes outside DuBois, said the comity between women pickleball players at an area YMCA dissipated when a regular showed up to play in a “Let’s Go Brandon” T-shirt, the slogan that has become a coded way of profanely disrespecting the president.",
    "Biden had just stopped off in Pittsburgh—about a two hours’ drive southwest—and pledged to get out more to sell not only his top-line initiatives but the hundreds of millions of dollars approved for rural family housing costs, protecting manufacturing jobs and upgrading school facilities so they could open.",
    "It wasn’t a partisan battle—voters from opposing parties found themselves campaigning for the same side—and that dynamic, along with the fact that most were able to move on and accept the result, serves as a sign that the civility that everyone once took for granted hasn’t disappeared completely.",
    "“That’s why all these people are supporting him so much.” In our conversations, both Lieber and Fitzpatrick kept returning to the impression they got during the pandemic when they separately took rides through the region: Many of the homes they passed with Trump paraphernalia looked like shacks.",
    "But the other 25 percent who voted for Joe Biden—9,673 people—find themselves in an unusual position: They supported the ultimate winner and yet a relentless and toxic campaign to delegitimize his victory and overturn the election makes them feel somehow as if they’re under siege.",
    "A neighbor noticed Maloney and her husband hadn’t been traveling as much as they used to, she says, and asked her if she was “afraid.” Maloney says she told her they were being careful, which included getting vaccinated, and the woman confessed that she hadn’t gotten the shot.",
    "And that another man got so upset with seeing face-coverings on a seemingly young, healthy person that he told the lifeguard he was a “pussy.”\n“These people have always been on the fringe, kind of hanging around the woodwork, and then he brought them all out,” Maloney says.",
    "It calls for targeting a sizable chunk of voters—by his estimate there are 15 percent to 17 percent nationally and as many as 22 percent in Pennsylvania who voted for Trump in 2020—and convincing enough of them to lock arms with Democrats to protect American democracy.",
    "And what people see is Washington fighting either over things that don’t matter directly to their daily lives or is [the legislation] going to be $3.5 trillion or $1.5 trillion, and not even the details of programs.”\n“There isn’t a presence of the Democratic Party.",

    "DUBOIS, Pa. — In the pandemic’s darkest days, a man living across the street from a Methodist church in this small town raised a flag in front of his house emblazoned with the words “Fuck Biden.”\nNeighbors were so repulsed they brought it up with church leadership.",
    "There’s evidence, though, that Democratic leadership isn’t any better at communicating right now than its traumatized voters, who are more likely to retreat into safe bubbles than evangelize for a president with an approval rating stuck in the low 40-percent range.",
    "While Democrats recovered some over the next decade and took back 10 governor’s offices and six legislative chambers, the party had a comparatively disappointing showing in 2020, with Biden winning 527 counties, according to an analysis by the Associated Press.",
    "Otherwise, how do they relate to someone who was raised rich, got an education and literally lived in a golden tower?”\nIf Terry Noble represents the most aggressive form of Democratic neighbor-to-neighbor outreach, he also represents a distinct minority.",

    "Today, the city’s newer crop of patrons has their families’ names on signs that decorate its fancy new ballfields—the Heindls in the pressed-metals industry; the Sterns who own a major cleaning business that serves the area’s large hospital chain.",
    "“I knew exactly what she meant.”\n“Before Trump, you didn’t know anyone’s political affiliation and now they found somebody that they can go with and so they put up all their signs everywhere,” Frank says, pulling his SUV to the side of a road.",

    "He gave them an affirmation to say what they wanted.”\nDemocrats’ bafflement can veer into condescension and elitism, which Trump effectively harnessed to muster his supporters against the establishment that he said looked down on them.",

    "It has just really made people into tribes.”\nLately, Noble has settled on an approach he thinks would help drive a wedge through the Trump coalition of Republicans, independents and even the small contingent who remain Democrats.",
    "But the fundamental question the party needs to answer—one that gnaws at everyone from the Foulkrods and Fitzpatrick to Biden’s advisers in Washington—is how far can they expect to get with people who refuse even to listen?",
    "In 2008, powered by organizing around Barack Obama in Pennsylvania’s presidential primary, Democrats briefly regained their edge with registered voters, but Obama ultimately took only 43 percent of the vote in the general.",

    "As proof, they recall how in 2020 Trump conceded to a throng in Erie, Pa., that there’s no way he would have headlined a rally in their community if Covid had not metastasized and damaged his record of accomplishments.",
    "The next morning, a newspaper in the state ran a commentary about Republican congressmen, Glenn “GT” Thompson and Mike Kelly, touting benefits from Biden’s legislative agenda back home after opposing the rescue act.",
    "She says she and other players chalked it up, along with the woman’s reaction to the vaccine, to how deep anti-Biden sentiments have burrowed and how deeply intertwined views about Trump and the virus have become.",
    "There are elections this fall for the U.S. Senate and governor, and Pennsylvania Democrats are plainly aware that their successes hinge on turning out rural voters, or at least narrowing their losses with them.",

    "She’s concerned Democrats aren’t taking advantage of their majorities to make needed advances here, and about a broader perception she shares that Democrats in Washington come off as unfocused and unmoored.",
    "“He brought out the worst in people.”\nLieber, a legislative assistant to former state Rep. Dan Surra, a Democrat who served from 1991 until he was defeated by a Republican in 2008, says she admires Biden.",
    "Bullock dove into the numbers from last fall’s Virginia governor’s race where, compared with 2008, the number of counties Republican Glenn Youngkin won with at least 70 percent increased roughly 10-fold.",
    "“So, that’s what drives me.”\nThe vestiges of ethnic tribalism linger in the old neighborhood names that chronicle the waves of immigrants who settled DuBois—Poles and Irish, Italians, Germans and Swedes.",

    "He wants them to get inflation under control and to start building planned transportation and infrastructure projects (“I mean, why does Europe have such a great train system, and we don’t?” he muses.).",
    "She remembers how another woman stormed out of a Brookville-based book club, telling the mask-wearing participants that she didn’t want to interact with people if she couldn’t see their mouths moving.",
    "Fitzpatrick, a retired special education aide, was on speaker phone with her husband Bill, a retired banker, one late afternoon in February as I caught up with the couple by phone from Washington.",
    "We were demonized over that.”\nNoble says it’s painful for him to watch candidates for local office who grew up in strong Democratic families switch their party affiliation just to be competitive.",
    "In these towns and counties, there remain thousands of Democrats like Fitzpatrick who are faithful to their party—and feel that they are paying an increasingly steep price for that loyalty.",

    "Even after the party lost its advantage—in the Clinton years, following the Monica Lewinsky scandal—the area still sent a handful of Democrats to the statehouse in Harrisburg.",
    "Once-benign personal encounters between acquaintances in bookstores and barber shops have turned into bitter, ridicule-infused standoffs over abiding by Covid-19 protocols.",
