    "Even Republicans who avoid repeating Trump's baseless election fraud claims have perpetuated the idea that Democrats cheated in the 2020 presidential election, routinely distorting the actions of state judges and officials as \"unconstitutional\" or \"illegal\" in settling legal disputes and questions over the mail-in voting law.",
    "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A statewide court declared Friday that Pennsylvania's expansive two-year-old mail-in voting law is unconstitutional, agreeing with challenges by Republicans who soured on mail-in voting after then-President Donald Trump began baselessly attacking it as rife with fraud in 2020's campaign.",
    "In Friday's decision, the three Republican judges agreed with Republican challengers — including 11 Republican lawmakers who actually voted for the law — and ruled that no-excuse mail-in voting is prohibited under the state constitution, until the constitution is changed to allow it.",
    "In 2019, the Republican-controlled Legislature authorized no-excuse mail-in voting for all voters, expanding upon a provision in the state constitution that required the state to provide the option for voters in specific circumstances.",
    "However, Republican challengers say the constitution intended that absentee voting be strictly limited, citing a passage that says voters must live in an election district for at least 60 days where they \"shall offer to vote.\"",
    "Wolf's office said its appeal means the lower court ruling has no immediate effect, and criticized Republicans as trying to kill the law \"in the service of the 'big lie'\" of Trump's baseless election fraud claims.",
    "In addition to baselessly attacking mail-in voting through much of 2020, Trump also later claimed, without evidence, that the election was stolen from him in critical battleground states including Pennsylvania.",
    "In one post-election lawsuit in 2020, Republicans sought to invalidate the mail-in voting law and throw out all ballots cast under it in a bid to overturn Democrat Joe Biden's victory in Pennsylvania.",
    "The mail-in voting law has become a hot topic on the campaign trail, with nearly every Republican candidate for governor — including two of three state senators who voted for it — vowing to repeal it.",
    "In the opinion, the three Republican judges agreed, saying that passage had been cited in two prior state Supreme Court decisions invalidating laws passed in 1839 and 1923 to expand absentee voting.",
    "In exchange, Wolf agreed to get rid of the straight-ticket voting ballot option that Republicans had sought as a way to protect their suburban candidates from an anti-Trump wave in 2020's election.",
    "Pennsylvania's attorney general, Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is running for governor, said he is confident the state Supreme Court will uphold the mail-in voting law as constitutional.",
    "Still, the decision throws Pennsylvania's voting laws into doubt as the presidential battleground state's voters prepare to elect a new governor and a new U.S. senator in 2022.",
    "Just over 2.5 million people voted under the law's expansion of mail-in voting in 2020's presidential election, most of them Democrats, out of 6.9 million total cast.",
    "The state Supreme Court threw it out, saying the plaintiffs \"failed to act with due diligence\" in waiting to challenge the law until after Trump lost the election.",
    "The decision, by a five-judge Commonwealth Court panel of three Republicans and two Democrats, was deemed to be on hold immediately since Gov.",
    "Every Republican lawmaker, except one, voted for the legislation in a deal with Wolf, a Democrat who had sought the mail-in voting provision.",
    "Those circumstances include being out of town on business, illness, physical disability, election-day duties or religious observance.",
    "The dissenting Democrats say a separate provision of the constitution empowered lawmakers to provide no-excuse mail-in voting.",
    "\"We need leaders to support removing more barriers to voting, not trying to silence the people,\" Wolf's office said.",
    "He criticized the lower court's opinion as \"based on twisted logic and faulty reasoning\" and \"wrong on the law.\"",
    "\"Big news out of Pennsylvania, great patriotic spirit is developing at a level that nobody thought possible.",
    "That provision says elections \"shall be by ballot or by such other method as may be prescribed by law.\"",
    "The Constitution does not explicitly say that the Legislature cannot extend absentee voting to others.",
    "The state Supreme Court — which will hear the appeal — has a 5-2 Democratic majority.",
    "Tom Wolf's administration swiftly appealed to the state Supreme Court.",
    "Trump said in a statement through his political action committee.",
    "The U.S. Supreme Court refused appeals to intervene.",
    "Trump and Republicans quickly lauded the decision.",
    "The two Democrats on the panel dissented.",
    "Make America Great Again!\""
