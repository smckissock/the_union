    "One of the best-known pollution cases ever to emerge from the U.S. drilling and fracking boom has entered a diff icult new phase as prosecutors pursue criminal charges against the state’s most prolific gas driller — and push for a settlement they say could yield more significant benefits for homeowners than a conviction.",
    "The state’s criminal case against the driller dates to 2020, when Attorney General Josh Shapiro — a Democrat now running for governor — charged Cabot with violating the law by allowing methane from the company’s faulty gas wells to escape into drinking-water aquifers in Dimock and nearby communities.",
    "These residents want to be hooked up to public water — itself a controversial idea in their rural community, one that state environmental officials talked up more than a decade ago but ultimately abandoned under legal threat from the driller and local officials.",
    "DIMOCK, Pa. — Meeting with a man whose well water has been polluted for years, officials in the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office asked him whether he’d consider accepting a treatment system from the gas driller charged with fouling his aquifer.",
    "Industry backers, meanwhile, touted the economic benefits of cheap gas and accused green groups of greatly exaggerating the threat, even as state regulators concluded that Texas-based Cabot Oil & Gas had fouled Dimock’s groundwater.",
    "State environmental officials had announced the $12 million plan to great fanfare, only to discard it months later under legal threat from Cabot and local officials, who called it a boondoggle and threatened to sue to block it.",
    "The residents’ opposition to treatment systems illustrates the delicacy of the attorney general’s task in Di-mock, where acrimony and distrust are the default after nearly 14 years of bad water and broken promises to fix it.",
    "A company spokesperson declined to comment, citing the “active legal matter.” The company has long defended its record and denied responsibility for the contamination of Dimock’s groundwater.",
    "“And the DEP and the gas company ruined it.” Kemble said Pennsylvania needed to follow through on its 2010 promise to force Cabot to connect the affected residents’ houses to public water.",
    "“Are you going to drink and bathe in it?” Kemble asked the prosecutor and her colleague, a special agent, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by The Associated Press.",
    "Handwritten logs show hundreds of visits by contractors over the years as the elaborate setup of tanks, filters and control panels broke down, leaked and failed to remove bacteria.",
    "PENALTIES LIMITED\nShapiro’s spokeswoman, Jacklin Rhoads, declined to answer questions about the “existence or substance of any discussions” with the company regarding a settlement.",
    "HIGH MAINTENANCE\nSome worked well, others were prone to breaking down, and all required costly upkeep, according to Joe Nally, who installed and maintained dozens of the systems.",
    "But the option prosecutors recently discussed has put them at odds with some residents who reject individual water treatment systems as inadequate and unworkable.",
    "It was an exploding water well that first aroused public attention in the previously anonymous patchwork of homes and farms about 150 miles north of Philadelphia.",
    "“So from your perspective, is it waterline or nothing?” Justus Brambley IV, a supervisory special agent with the state attorney general’s office, asked Kemble.",
    "The filters, for example, tended to clog quickly, and a single system could go through $200 to $300 worth of filters every week at a minimum, he said.",
    "“This was supposed to be our forever home,” said Deb Maye, who had moved with her family to Dimock to escape the bustle of the Philadelphia suburbs.",
    "In 2010, after discarding their plan to connect residents to public water, state environmental officials entered into a settlement with the company.",
    "It’s not clear if treatment systems remain under consideration, given the pushback from residents, but Kemble has his reasons for being skeptical.",
    "Cabot offered to install individual water filtration systems, as well as a monetary award equal to twice the tax value of each resident’s home.",
    "Eventually, the Department of Environmental Protection allowed Cabot to hand financial responsibility for repairs and maintenance to the Mayes.",
    "The agreement, struck without residents’ input or consent, infuriated those who had made it clear they did not trust Cabot with their water.",
    "Anti-drilling celebrities and documentary filmmakers descended, holding Dimock up as an example of drilling pollution in the nation’s No.",
    "Around that time, residents began reporting their well water was making them sick with symptoms including nausea, dizziness and rashes.",
    "“Are you two going to come here and live in this house on that system for a month and use that water?” The officials demurred.",
    "But she said the penalty for a conviction under the state’s Clean Streams Law is a maximum $50,000 fine for each violation.",
    "The Mayes now use their untreated well water for bathing and flushing toilets, and bottled water for everything else.",
    "The system Cabot installed at Tim and Deb Maye’s house now sits, disused, in a shed outside their home.",
    "Defeated, regulators arranged for Cabot to pay for the individual water filtration systems instead.",
    "“It was absolutely a maintenance issue with them,” said Nally, who left the industry years ago.",
    "The hoopla eventually died down, but Dimock’s water remained polluted.",
    "Fresh contamination cases have been reported as recently as December.",
    "But many residents took the money — and the treatment systems.",
    "The couple said they never agreed to that.",
    "The system never worked right, they said.",
    "“Waterline or nothing,” Kemble said.",
    "Not a chance, Ray Kemble told them.",
    "2 gas-producing state.",
