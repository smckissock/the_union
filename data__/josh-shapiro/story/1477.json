Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, received the second-highest percentage of support with 19.9%, followed by Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Bellefonte, with 5.1%, former U.S. District Attorney William McSwain at 4.4%, and state Sen.

    "“The DGA is trying to rehash old recycled political smear talking points because they see the same numbers we see: Lou Barletta is a strong candidate to challenge Josh Shapiro, who won’t be able to defend his own failed record as attorney general.” The complaint now goes before the six-member Federal Election Commission, which is largely toothless.",
    "But in an email, DGA Deputy Communications Director Sam Newton said that Barletta is “a corrupt politician who said one thing to Pennsylvanians\n… then used their money to line his own pockets with tens of thousands of dollars.” “That type of shady self-dealing shows he can’t be trusted to be anywhere near the governorship,” he added.",
    "The complaint called this “a troubling sign indicating the Representative may have been either enriching himself by overpaying or illegally undercharging his committee.” “Either way, Representative Barletta’s funneling campaign funds to his own property likely violated federal election law,” the DGA concluded.",
