    "President Donald J. Trump:\n“Attorney General Brnovich of Arizona was given massive information on the fraud and so-called ‘irregularities’ that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election…rather than go after the people that committed these election crimes, it looks… pic.twitter.com/a5T2OOqk0F\n— Liz Harrington (@realLizUSA) April 18, 2022\nMeanwhile, pinned to the top of his personal Twitter account, Brnovich still has a photo of himself with Trump, as he tweeted on January 15, “Great to have you in Arizona Mr. President!”\nGreat to have you in Arizona Mr. President!",
    "We can report that there are problematic system-wide issues that relate to early ballot handling and verification.”\nIn a letter to Arizona state Sen. Karen Fann, Brnovich wrote, “We have reached the conclusion that the 2020 election in Maricopa County revealed serious vulnerabilities that must be addressed and raises questions about the 2020 election in Arizona.”\n“We can report hat there are problematic system-wide issues that relate to early ballot handling and verification.",
    "Well, he did a report, and he recites some of the many horrible things that happened in that very dark period of American history, but rather than go after the people that committed these election crimes, it looks like he is just going to “kick the can down the road” and stay in that middle path of non-controversy.",
    "https://t.co/Pgogo9A7uO\n— Mark Brnovich (@GeneralBrnovich) April 6, 2022\nBelow is Trump’s statement as he responded to the report:\nAttorney General Brnovich of Arizona was given massive information on the fraud and so-called ‘irregularities’ that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election.",
    "Because of this election, the USA is “going to hell” with inflation, Russia attacking Ukraine, the loss of Energy Independence, 5-dollar gasoline, a wide-open Border and, or course, the incompetence with which our pull-out from Afghanistan was handled.",
    "It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 ballots were transported without a proper chain of custody.”\nI just dropped off our initial review of the 2020 election audit to President Fann.",
    "Former President Donald Trump released a statement Monday and ripped into Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, over a report he released two weeks ago about the 2020 election.",
    "He also admitted, “In multiple instances, Maricopa County failed to follow critical procedures when transporting early ballots from drop locations to the election headquarters.",
    "I felt differently because the numbers and sheer amount of crime committed is so compelling, irrefutable, and determinative – the election result would be entirely different.",
    "Now people are upset with the fact that while he states the problem, he seems to be doing nothing about it – he doesn’t give the answers.",
    "Trump says Brnovich, who is now running for U.S. Senate, waited entirely too long to release the report, and offered no solutions.",
    "Because of the amount of time that it took him to do the report, which was endless, his poll numbers have been rapidly sinking.",
    "The early ballot signature verification system in Maricopa County is insufficient to guard against abuse,” Brnovich wrote.",

    "With an honest election, none of these things would have been a problem, they were all self-inflicted wounds.",
    "Many people said that he would do nothing about it because that just seems to be the way he is.",
    "The good news is Arizona has some very good people running for election to the U.S. Senate.",
    "What a shame for the Great State of Arizona, and for our Country itself!",
    "I will be making an Endorsement in the not too distant future!",
