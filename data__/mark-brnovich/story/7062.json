    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCAVUTO: Now, keep in mind, that was in an interview I had with the Ukrainian ambassador of the United States, Oksana Markarova, blasting the inhumanity of Russian soldiers' attacks on civilians of the country before she even knew of what befell Bucha, where hundreds were executed, mostly women and children and just average civilians, in a way and a method we had never seen before in this war.",
    "CAVUTO: So, if you looked at -- the timing of this struck me as being more than just a little coincidental, where there was a storming of the border in the south part of Mexico, at Guatemala, where a lot of refugees were making their way, maybe sensing that all of this starts going away in May, and they had better odds to come and just sort of break into the United States.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nCAVUTO: What the ambassador was saying -- and I know you have gotten into this before, Dan, in prior conversations we have -- that however this ends in Ukraine -- and we hope it ends soon and with nothing approaching the horror we have just seen -- if Vladimir Putin is still in charge of Russia, those sanctions and punishments will remain in effect.",

    "SCHMITT: Yes, I mean, look, this -- if the Biden administration were to do three things, three things, reinstitute the remain-in-Mexico policy, as the court has ordered, finish the border wall, and keep Title 42, it would go a long way, not only just practically quelling illegal immigration, but sending a strong signal, we don't want you to come here illegally.",
    "NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, we are continuing to monitor Pentagon spokesman John Kirby here, again saying that he's making sure, as is the Pentagon, documenting all clear war crimes, this as much of the European Union and the NATO powers at be have sped up reaction to add sanctions and further punishments to Russia in light of these developments.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nMELUGIN: And, Neil, now that the news is out there that Title 42 will be dropping on May 23, the GOP House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, has announced he is going to be leading a delegation, a trip here to the Southern border later on this month to highlight what he says are the Biden administration's destructive border policies.",
    "And I would hope, to get to your second point, that perhaps the atrocities that have been promulgated by the Russians will get the United States and NATO to stop being deterred by Putin and reverse their current antiseptic posture towards supporting Ukraine with more capable weapons, because that's what they need, more capable weapons.",
    "We have been so focused on the brutality in Bucha, we have lost sight, some have, that Russia just continues going after, in this case, oil depots and oil refineries, the same thing it took great offense to when it charged that Ukrainian soldiers were targeting oil depots that it said in Russia, at least, were not legitimate targets.",
    "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCAVUTO: All right, do not say that our own Bill Melugin didn't warn you months ago, actually over a year ago, telegraphing problems at the border, and now compounded by a growing indication that come, well, next month, things could get a whole lot worse\nBill Melugin in La Joya, Texas, with the latest -- Bill.",
    "I think -- I just want to emphasize we owe a debt of gratitude to our FOX News intrepid journalists and their colleagues from other networks and other media who are out there on the front lines at great personal risk recording all of these crimes, these human rights crimes that Russia is committing.",
    "Well, if you think things are crazy in Ukraine, particularly at the border, with some neighboring states that are taking in all of those Ukrainian refugees, about 4.5 million by less count, you should take a look at what's been happening at our border and what could get worse in the weeks ahead.",
    "Take a look at part of the way that lawsuit reads, in part -- quote -- \"This suit challenges an imminent, manmade, self-induced calamity, the abrupt elimination of the only safety valve preventing this administration's disastrous border policies from devolving into an unmitigated catastrophe.\"",
    "We still believe that, while our president and our brave armed forces are defending our country and all of us will never surrender, but we always would want a diplomatic solution, because we value every life, and we want to save as many lives as possible, as our president said.",
    "I mean, this is something that General Jack Keane has raised with us, that he wonders oftentimes whether the administration might be more concerned with inciting Vladimir Putin's wrath if he loses than just living with maybe a more responsibly acting Vladimir Putin if he wins.",
    "By the way, the fact that Europe might move so quickly to suspend and outright deny Russian energy, oil, natural gas shipments did have the effect you might think it would, lifting up oil and natural gas prices today, on the notion here that that's going to limit supply.",
    "But what I tell you is I think that Putin's military is trying to consolidate territorial gains, where they have made them and where they're not being pushed back, because they're trying to set themselves up for optimizing their conflict-termination negotiating position.",
    "And even just a year ago, when Russia had 70,000 troops on Ukraine's border, total violation of the U.N. Charter, Article Two, threatening Ukraine's sovereignty, their territorial integrity, we gave Vladimir Putin a summit, and we did not prepare for this eventuality.",
    "CAVUTO: Attorney General, keep us posted on this, Eric Schmitt, one of three attorneys general right now who are protesting the administration's move to drop this Title 42 in May, and the implications all of this could have for the U.S., and Mexico, while we're at it.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMARK BRNOVICH (R), ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL: So, we want to stop the Biden administration from rescinding Title 42 because it may be one of the most boneheaded decisions of this administration, and they have done a lot of dumb things.",
    "And Minister Reznikov again thanked the United States for all the things that we're providing, the speed with which we're providing it, and noted that his forces are getting these weapons and systems and are using them very effectively in the field.",
    "Another point I'd like to make, Neil -- and if it didn't come through loud and clear with the reporting of the atrocities, I wish people would stop talking about the Russians making so-called indiscriminate attacks, as they're anything but that.",
    "I want to go to Peter Doocy here, because the administration, in light of these horrors in Bucha, is considering additional sanctions and measures, just when you think we're running out of such punishments, but, Peter, apparently not.",
    "John, you have probably heard that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that no war crimes were committed here, and that a lot of these images -- and we just want to warn our viewers they're particularly graphic and brutal.",
    "Now, while 26 U.S. cities have similar programs, one big critique of UBI is whether guaranteeing a degree of security will shrink the labor force, slow economic output, and potentially fossilize inequality with less incentive to work.",
    "Again, we are continuing to monitor these developments and how widespread the response will be, whether all countries will be in unison on immediate upping of sanctions and punishments against Russia, in light of these Bucha attacks.",
    "There's absolutely no reason, in fact, we can't provide the Ukrainians with MiG- 29s, S-300s, more capable drones, surface-to-surface and anti-ship missiles and even old U.S. fighters that we're retiring, like F-15s and F-16s.",
    "Increasingly, you're going to see not only the Russian economy put more and more at risk in terms of its health, but you're also going to continue to see Russia itself and Mr. Putin continually isolated by the world community.",
    "With respect to Odessa, it's important to remember that any land attack by the Russians, I think, is currently delayed, or suspended, actually, as Ukrainians have pushed the Russian move in that direction, back to Kherson.",
    "And that's why we're going to participate with the international community on making sure that we can document the evidence of these war crimes, so that Russia can be held properly -- properly accountable when it's over.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: We are pulling people off the border for stretches of 200 miles; 200 miles are completely and totally unpatrolled at any given point in time.",
    "Now, this is not the Pentagon's purview, obviously, economic sanctions and the rest, but a lot of people are surprised that there are still more sanctions and punishments that could be meted out for Russia.",
    "After thousands of flights were canceled or delayed because of unusually bad weather in Florida, the spillover continued today with still more flights suffering big delays, if not outright cancellations.",
    "Now, coupled with bad weather close to Florida, you had a lot of spring- breakers Neil trapped in Orlando, Miami, and Fort Lauderdale, and lots of congestion in Vegas on the weekends, as you know, Neil.",
    "So, as a result, I think Putin just pushed up the Russian body count in coming weeks, and any prospect of Ukraine's accepting surrender of their territory as part of any deal just went down the drain.",
    "CAVUTO: John, much has been made -- and you have been asked this multiple times -- from people like General Jack Keane as to whether the administration's heart is really in seeing Ukraine win this.",
    "And the way the Ukrainians are operating now, it may be possible that they even overrun Kherson in the next week or two, and that would cut off supply for the whole Russian southern force package.",
    "And we also should point out that these bodies that are being discovered appear to be civilians, people who are not in military uniforms, who many officials say were executed merely for existing.",
    "But these are their decisions to make, sovereign decisions that they have to make about what a peace settlement is going to look like and what that means for Ukrainian sovereignty going forward.",
    "We live in America today where your ideology is held against you if you're a conservative, and when you're a liberal, we're supposed to embrace everything about you and not ask hard questions.",
    "While some have managed to escape the near-nonstop bombardments to safer cities like Zaporizhzhia, roughly 100,000 people remain trapped and cut off from essential services just to stay alive.",
    "Regardless, I'd be curious what you make of the fact that, from Germany to France to Italy, there's been a call now to sever all of those natural gas and oil shipments, like, now .Don't wait.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nCARLOS ROMAN, OWNER, BREAD & BARLEY: Giving somebody who's inclined to take those positions a universal basic income is probably going to make them want to work less hours.",
    "So you're probably looking at all those thousands of flights canceled and a lot of travelers marooned and thinking, hey, I'm supposed to fly for Easter and the holiday and into the summer.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nO'GRADY: And Carlos shared with me he's already had to hike wages amidst this current labor shortage, something he'd have to do if this program were to become widespread.",
    "Look, we have -- we said even before this invasion that the Russians were going to be very brutal in the way they effect their military operations and conduct themselves inside Ukraine.",
    "Just on Saturday alone, DHS sources telling us the Del Rio Sector had more than 1,600 illegal crossings, including a 45-minute span, where they had more than 200 people cross illegally.",
    "With the Russians now targeting a lot of these ports cities, and upping the ante and the brutality, as they have in Bucha, and maybe hinting of more to come, where are we on this war?",
    "And I did not know that the CDC on health matters sort of had the yea or nay sort of authority to just cancel a policy that many argue at least was working or mitigating the problem.",
    "And that means hundreds of thousands, if not millions of travelers that were affected, a combination, as you mentioned, of bad weather in the Southeast, tech issues, a pilots strike.",
    "He has been very clear that he wants all of Ukraine, and he wants to -- he wants the sovereignty and the territorial integrity that Ukraine should have and had before this invasion.",
    "So the airstrikes on Odessa are -- and some of the other port cities are really the same as elsewhere, where oil fuel storage and, don't forget, civilians are hit to instill fear.",
    "CAVUTO: You have probably heard that President Zelenskyy is showing a tad bit of frustration with a lot of countries in terms of getting aid to him, but getting it there quickly.",
    "And following a development in California that has a whole lot of folks watching on this idea of getting a check actually for doing nothing, $1,000 a month for up to three years.",
    "Three Republican-led states Arizona, Missouri, and Louisiana, announced today they are suing the Biden administration over its decision to drop Title 42 on May 23 of next month.",
    "Dan, this is part of a strategy we have often seen out of the Russians to just terrify civilians and maybe get them so fearful, so anxious that they just want to quit the war.",
    "Of course, it all goes back to these horrific images we're getting out of Bucha, Ukraine, and growing concerns right now that this is a bad situation that it's turning worse.",
    "And that's why I have been saying repeatedly that we have to uphold the sanctions for many years to come, because we are going to live with Mr. Putin for many years to come.",
    "Something else that officials here are talking about today, amid these reports that the Russians might be retreating, they don't think that means that the Russians are done.",
    "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOKSANA MARKAROVA, UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: The Russians are doing unspeakable war crimes on the territory of Ukraine.",
    "KIRBY: Well, I don't want to get inside the Ukrainian decision-making here with respect to peace deals and negotiated settlements that they are pursuing with the Russians.",
    "We are on top of those developments and also on top of what happens next as far as Ukrainian soldiers who are quickly turning around the fight in ways very few people saw.",
    "Participants must be over the age of 18, live in a qualifying community, and make less than, as you said, $56,000 for a single household and $96,000 for a family of four.",
    "Meanwhile, in Washington and the development about the president's choice to become the next associate justice on the Supreme Court, it is and potentially speeding along.",
    "Russia has caused billions of dollars' worth of damage to Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, on top of all of the civilians whom Russia has killed in this barbaric war.",
    "Let's get the latest from Jeff Paul in Lviv, Ukraine, where we're already hearing a number of top experts saying there's no doubt that war crimes are being committed.",
    "CAVUTO: Still, the Russian strategy of taking out some of these port cities, or at least making it very difficult for aid did come in, there's a strategy to that too.",
    "And I think that we have had probably the best Festivus celebration here in this hearing over the last week or so, because there's been a lot of airing of grievances.",
    "And, certainly, the devastating images coming out of Bucha, I think, contributes to that level of disgust and new decision- making by some of our allies and partners.",
    "Again, Mr. Zelenskyy has to determine what he believes is in the best interests for Ukraine and what he wants to negotiate and what he's willing to put on the table.",
    "They say that decision will have catastrophic impacts here on the border, and they're going to do whatever they can to try to hold that decision up in the courts.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nPAUL: Now, along the coast in the city of Mariupol, the mayor there now saying he believes Russian forces have destroyed 90 percent of the city.",
    "According to British intelligence, MI6, Russia's invasion plans included these sorts of summary executions by Russia's military and their intelligence services.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nMELUGIN: In the meantime, Title 42 is still in effect for now and still illegal crossings are nonstop and they are happening in broad daylight.",
    "And one of the things that I was reminded of, Dan -- I want to get your take on this after you listen to this -- is the idea of how long all of this drags out.",
    "CAVUTO: Jeff, the Russian foreign minister, as I'm sure you're aware, has disavowed any responsibility or that Russia has any responsibility for these attacks.",
    "Again, you have the cartels running the show down there, vicious gangs that are sending drugs in -- trafficking human beings into our country every single day.",
    "CAVUTO: So their defense seems a little weird in this sense, Attorney General, that if Title 42 were working, we would not have the surge at the border we are.",
    "But there was this sense that maybe -- and this was raised by our own Bret Baier with President Zelenskyy -- about the possibility of a Vladimir Putin losing.",
    "Russia is repositioning its forces to concentrate its offensive operations in Eastern and parts of Southern Ukraine, rather than target most of the territory.",
    "And scrambling right now to deal with the economic ramifications of severing ties with their main supplier of hydrocarbons, that's an extraordinary challenge.",
    "The Red Cross repeatedly over the last few days has tried to get their buses in that are lined up to deliver aid and to get people out to safer situations.",
    "It makes it that much harder to hire, because I'm already limited by the people I can choose and how many hours they're willing to work in the first place.",
    "Many new nations now -- or nations that weren't willing to make certain steps are now willing to, in light of what they're seeing inside Ukraine.",
    "We want their sovereignty respected, their territorial integrity to be observed by the rest of the international community, particularly Russia.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nPERGRAM: The committee delayed a vote on Jackson, as Democratic California Senator Alex Padilla struggled to get to Washington.",
    "But for the people who lost sons, who have lost daughters, wives, husbands, the heartbreak is very real, and their lives will never be the same.",
    "And one has to begin to question, just why is the United States of America, the world's most powerful nation, being deterred by Vladimir Putin?",
    "So there's frustration with Germany on the part of prominent Ukrainians, all the way up to the president, that they could have done more early.",
    "Something they are not expected to do, though, is side with Volodymyr Zelenskyy about whether or not a genocide is being committed in Ukraine.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): And we're supposed to be like trained seals over here clapping when you appoint a liberal.",
    "And we will see what those new offensive operations that they're trying to conduct in the east, what that means for where this war goes.",
    "And he says Democrats expect Republicans to be fair to liberal nominees, yet Democrats don't return the favor to nominees on the right.",
    "In fact, tomorrow's big event, they're going to host Barack Obama here to celebrate the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act -- Neil.",
    "And this is, unfortunately, the Biden administration's attempt to, again, open up the Southern border in a way we have not seen before.",
    "But as long as Russia exists, Ukraine is going to need a massive infusion of military assistance and security guarantees from the West.",
    "HOFFMAN: Yes, so this is going to be challenging from an economic standpoint, because Europe has to import gas and oil from somewhere.",
    "SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so, Neil, we're talking about 12,000 flights that were either delayed or canceled this weekend.",
    "We have a lot more coming up, including what was a nightmare weekend for travelers, and all because of some nasty weather in Florida.",
    "These are buildings that we have seen had holes blown in them, schools that have been targeted, Mariupol itself 90 percent destroyed.",
    "But there are no details available about exactly where Putin would be tried or how they would get him out of Russia to stand a trial.",
    "A law enforcement agent told us $100 million a week in value of human trafficking, all the fentanyl that's coming across the border.",
    "If there's additional sanctions or economic measures to be applied, that is certainly something that President Biden would speak to.",
    "In the meantime, we have no doubt that what happened in Bucha and those atrocities were the Russians, and that they're responsible.",
    "Now, I spoke with a restaurant owner here, and he said he's already struggling to find people to fill those entry-level positions.",
    "And again to put it in context, the migrant protection protocols, the remain-in-Mexico policy was effective under President Trump.",
    "In the meantime, 1,000 bucks a month for 36 months, a lucky few thousand who could take advantage of that, no strings attached.",
    "But, again, I guess among them, John, is ending these ties to Russian oil and natural gas, not down the road, but immediately.",
    "In fact, just over the last couple of days, we helped facilitate the transfer of six shipments by about six different nations.",
    "And when we talk about these bodies that are being discovered in the Kyiv region, it's important to keep a few things in mind.",
    "Why those states say that decision will lead to a catastrophe here at our Southern border -- coming up right after the break.",
    "Well, I'd like to remind folks that are saying that, during the Vietnam War, we had nuclear weapons, and so did the Russians.",
    "Many point to the pandemic stimulus checks and our current worker shortage is an example of how UBI could damage our economy.",
    "And that's due to briefly pausing our service earlier this morning as we worked to resolve an intermittent technology issue.\"",
    "And that stranded a lot of folks in airports across the country, with social media posts of many makeshift beds and tents.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nMAREK MAGIEROWSKI, POLISH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: We have to be determined to wage a long war.",
    "Stop firing, raining down hell on Ukrainian civilians, and this can end and we can normalize our relationship with Russia.",
    "So, without Padilla, Democrats lacked the votes to even get a tie on the nomination in committee when Padilla was absent.",
    "We -- we're certainly in constant communication with them, providing them advice, counsel and information as best we can.",
    "That only leaves you then saying, all right, well, if the Russians didn't do it, what, do you assume the Ukrainians did?",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nDOOCY: We don't know the next time that we're going to get a reaction from President Biden about this.",
    "We expect a floor vote in the Senate tonight to extract the Jackson nomination from committee and put it on the floor.",
    "CAVUTO: John, you probably heard President Zelenskyy cite Germany as having blocked its push to become a NATO member.",
    "Title 42 has been a very effective means for sending back hundreds of thousands of people who've come here illegally.",
    "And the Russians supplied 100 percent of the North Vietnamese with MiGs and tanks and surface-to-air missile systems.",
    "And we're told by the national security adviser to expect a new announcement about sanctions by the end of this week.",
    "So, reversing what had been a two-day decline, a two-day business day decline in oil prices, now over $103 a barrel.",
    "There's no question about it, because at least it gives the tools to those Border Patrol agents to expel some folks.",
    "And we have said now for a couple of weeks that we had clear evidence that the Russians were committing war crimes.",
    "Three Republican-led states are now suing the Biden administration over their decision to drop Title 42 next month.",
    "Now, the Russian Defense Ministry is trying to tell the world this is all fake, something fabricated as propaganda.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTANYA NEDASHKIVS'KA, BUCHA RESIDENT (through translator): Please, I'm begging you, do something.",
    "As we start to see more and more of these Russian forces pull out, God knows what we're going to discover -- Neil.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We believe that Russia is revising its war aims.",
    "It seemed that President Zelenskyy was even revisiting Crimea and whether that should be back in Ukraine's hands.",
    "ERIC SCHMITT (R), MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, I think, first of all, it's important to put this in context.",
    "Of course, President Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for more aid, more military aid, and the sooner the better.",
    "This is video we shot in Del Rio Sector over the weekend, where we repeatedly witnessed mass illegal crossings.",
    "And now, given these Russian attacks on key port cities like Odessa, isn't that going to be more difficult now?",
    "That means he will also be hiking the cost of a burger and fries, which is certainly not what we want out here.",
    "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCAVUTO: Thousands of flights were canceled or delayed, and many still delayed as of today.",
    "And some people have said, well, the Russians have nuclear weapons, so we have got to be concerned with that.",
    "It's hard to have a sovereign border when the federal government is essentially letting go of the rope here.",
    "These are people, human beings who had lives, who had freedom up until five weeks ago, before this invasion.",
    "So I want to allow them a little time to opt out of seeing this, so, if we can hold off a few seconds, guys.",
    "Now, JetBlue and Southwest both reported nearly 40 percent of their flights were either delayed or canceled.",
    "But I think, look, it's going to be up to President Zelenskyy to determine what victory is, what winning is.",
    "KIRBY: Well, I would tell you, Neil, that we continue to provide a lot of security assistance into Ukraine.",
    "And, as we have said before many, many times, it's not up to Mr. Putin whether a nation joins NATO or not.",
    "And the second and last point I will make is that this is an opportunity for President Biden to emphasize.",
    "And as Ukraine stays in the fight, and wins, we hope, that will have an impact on Vladimir Putin's future.",
    "And they tweeted that: \"We are experiencing flight disruptions,\" they call it, \"across our network today.",
    "They're trying to tear apart all three of those things that were working under the Trump administration.",
    "But Title 42 is another very effective piece under the Trump administration to stop illegal immigration.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): One of the aspects of Festivus is the airing of grievances.",
    "We're going to see a surge in a very, very busy time, in the summertime, like we have not seen before.",
    "But we know that there's nothing on the schedule Ukraine- or Russia-related for the rest of this week.",
    "We're on that and other cities that are under attack, including some crucial coastal ones in Ukraine.",
    "Now, Austria stands out saying, well, wait a minute, let's not do something crazy here that hurts us.",
    "And so what we're arguing is, look, they haven't gone about this the right way in the first place.",
    "There are three attorneys general, as Bill pointed out, who are suing over dropping this Title 42.",
    "Since Joe Biden's been in office, you have seen waves and waves and waves of illegal immigration.",
    "One, the images you're about to watch are very graphic, but this goes beyond just horrific video.",
    "And a lot of it is how he interprets loss and what -- and what he ends up claiming are his goals.",
    "He offered it as sort of like an olive branch or a possible negotiating point to end all of this.",
    "But, clearly -- and I said this just last week -- we obviously want the Ukrainians to win here.",
    "It's me talking, a Ukrainian woman, a Ukrainian woman, a mother of two kids and one grandchild.",
    "General, could I ask you, first of all, the administration is arguing that this is a CDC call.",
    "We are told that Del Rio Sector's numbers have now reached more than 200,000 since October 1.",
    "And that includes these shipments in this material that, again, is arriving every single day.",
    "The floor vote tonight could tell us where GOP Senators Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney stand.",
    "KIRBY: Yes, that's right out of the Russian playbook, Neil, deny, deny, deny, lie, lie, lie.",
    "Alaska was dealing with a pilot strike, which affected tens of thousands of their travelers.",
    "It's -- like I said, it's going to -- you're going to see a tsunami of illegal immigration.",
    "Russia's foreign minister, speaking on behalf of Vladimir Putin, says that simply isn't so.",
    "BIDEN: No, no -- go -- go -- the war crimes -- yes, I'm going to continue to add sanctions.",

    "KIRBY: It doesn't complicate -- complicate our pursuit of helping them defend themselves.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nPERGRAM: GOP Senator Lindsey Graham previously voted to confirm Jackson.",
    "And that is absolutely critical going forward to prosecuting the Russians who deserve it.",
    "DAN HOFFMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Russia is just following their playbook.",
    "CAVUTO: Do you think that could ever happen, Dan, with Vladimir Putin in charge, though?",
    "Others collapsed on the side of the road in nearly the same position after being killed.",
    "To Dan Hoffman right now, the former CIA station chief in Moscow, FOX News contributor.",
    "And the irony of this is that Vladimir Putin's fate is now intertwined with Ukraine's.",
    "And the president of the Border Patrol union says it's going to get a whole lot worse.",
