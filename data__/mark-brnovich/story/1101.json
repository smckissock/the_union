    "The Arizona Legislature ended the use of execution by lethal gas in 1992, but it left in place the use of gas for people who had already been sentenced at that time, leaving 17 people potentially subject to this form of execution.",
    "“What we're asking the court to do is essentially order the defendants to tell us and the court, whether there are any facts or if anything has changed since the protocol that’s been in place since the late 1990s,” said Keenen.",
    "To think that it was done to millions of people during the Holocaust is horrific enough, but to think that 70 to 80 years later we're thinking of using it as a method of capital punishment is mindboggling,” said Friebaum.",
    "“Arizona has acknowledged the horrors of cyanide gas as a method of execution and eliminated it in all but a narrow set of cases – it’s time the court eliminates the use of cyanide gas for execution once and for all.",
