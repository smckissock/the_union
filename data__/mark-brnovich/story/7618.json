    "Last month, the former president went on to demand to know whether Brnovich would do “the right thing.” Soon after, Trump called on the state attorney general to take the matter to “the next level.” He also held a rally in Arizona in which he told supporters, in reference to Brnovich, “I think he’s going to do his job — we’ll find out.”\nSubtle it was not.",
    "Recommended\nInstead, the state attorney general released a report yesterday that was critical of assorted election procedures, while simultaneously conceding that there’s no evidence of widespread fraud that would’ve changed the outcome of the Grand Canyon State’s 2020 results.",
    "On the other hand, he’s also Arizona’s top law enforcement official, who’s faced intense lobbying from the former president to “help” with the party’s crusade against the 2020 election.",
    "“The lackluster Attorney General of Arizona, Mark Brnovich, has to get on the ball and catch up with the great Republican patriots in the Arizona State Senate,” Trump added.",

    "Trump even issued a written statement law year, saying Brnovich was “nowhere to be found” in helping spread ridiculous ideas about the 2020 race.",
    "To be sure, Brnovich couldn’t come right out and say, “The conspiracy theories are baseless,” because then his Senate candidacy would be doomed.",
    "As Politico recently put it, Brnovich is effectively “caught in a vice.”\nWith this in mind, Trump’s pressure campaign has been overt and public.",
    "It’s against this backdrop that NBC News reported on the Arizona Republican’s latest findings related to the 2020 campaign.",
    "He also couldn’t manufacture evidence of election irregularities out of thin air, because that would constitute fraud.",
    "The more Brnovich boosts Trump’s Big Lie, the more it’s likely to help his statewide campaign.",
    "Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich is in a politically tricky position.",
