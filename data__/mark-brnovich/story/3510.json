    "At issue is, “Whether the Constitution allows the government to prohibit law-abiding, responsible citizens from protecting themselves, their families, and their homes with a type of ‘Arms’ that are in common use for lawful purposes?”\nMaryland’s 2013 law, one of the strictest in the country, requires residents to undergo safety training and fingerprinting in order to get a license to legally purchase a pistol.",
    "“Arizona and forty-two other states allow the commonly-used firearms that Maryland has banned outright.”\nJoining Arizona and West Virginia are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.",
    "I’m hopeful that they will.”\nThe Supreme Court’s recent order indicates that at least one justice on the bench wants a response and “likely means that the court will hold this petition pending a decision in NYSRPA v.

    "But after these court cases, “the high court largely went silent on the Second Amendment,” he said, “for the better part of a decade.”\n“We tried repeatedly to persuade them to hear other challenges,” and the latest in that effort is requesting the court to hear the Maryland case, he said.",
    "Such an unconstitutional act cannot stand.”\nIf the Fourth Circuit’s decision isn’t overruled by the Supreme Court, it would set case law governing any similar law passed in West Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, the attorneys general argue.",
    "Kansas AG Derek Schmidt, a strong Second Amendment defender, told The Center Square that he was pleased that the high court recognized the Second Amendment was a fundamental right in Heller and extended that in McDonald v. Chicago (2010).",

    "“We don’t think that political actors, legislatures get to pick and choose which weapons in common use are available to Americans and we’ve asked the Supreme Court to take the case and give us greater definition.",
    "They’re asking the court to ultimately strike down the law, which the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld last September, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court in support of the petitioners.",
    "Just In...\nTwenty-five states, led by Arizona and West Virginia, are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear Bianchi v. Frosh, which challenges Maryland's restrictive Firearms Safety Act of 2013.",
    "“Holding Bianchi would be consistent with the hold that the Court has apparently placed on the petition filed in the New Jersey ‘large-capacity magazine’ case, ANJRPC v. Bruck,” the group adds.",
    "“A decision in Bruen this spring may mean that the court will thereafter vacate the lower court decisions in both Bianchi and ANJRPC and remand for further consideration in light of Bruen.",
    "“Americans bearing these firearms benefit public safety, counterbalance the threat of illegal gun violence, and help make our streets safer,” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said.",

    "The lower court “inappropriately limited the scope of the Second Amendment by taking an earlier Supreme Court ruling out of context,” the AGs argue.",
    "The 2013 law “goes against Supreme Court precedent and steps on the Second Amendment,” West Virginia Attorney General Morrisey argues.",
    "The state of Maryland “has essentially enumerated large specific lists of firearms that are not to be permitted as lawful to posses.",
    "The AGs argue the ruling should be clarified to extend to sporting rifles, including AR-15s, in \"common use.\"",
    "Still, Maryland gun control advocates are pushing for even more gun restrictions to be passed.",
    "We don’t think that approach is permissible under the Second Amendment,” Schmidt said.",
    "“Law-abiding gun owners routinely use these firearms for self-defense or sporting.",
    "That cases’ petition has been pending in the Supreme Court since April 2021.",
    "The Center for American Progress says the law has made Maryland safer.",
    "“All of this is good news,” Maryland Shall Issue says.",
    "At least, we hope that is the outcome.”"
