    "Manchin called the president’s plan “frightening,” reminding everyone that “we are nowhere near prepared to deal with [the] influx.” “Until we have comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform that commits to securing our borders and providing a pathway to citizenship for qualified immigrants,” he argued, “Title 42 must stay in place.”\nSenator Mark Warner (D-Va.) piled on, insisting that he would be “very reluctant to end this Trump policy until we [have] a real plan in place.” “I think we are a generous country, but we have to be a country of [the] rule of law.” Funny, Brnovich pointed out, that’s what Republicans have been saying all along.",
    "And it’s not just the border states who would suffer, he pointed out on “Washington Watch.” “We know that there’s a record amount of fentanyl and methamphetamine flowing into our country… And it’s estimated that if Title 42 is rescinded, more than 500,000 people — in addition to the [ones] already illegally crossing — will cross… That’s literally like the population of Kansas City, Missouri or Baltimore, Maryland coming across in one month.” It’s already overwhelming our social systems, Brnovich warns.",
    "If the Left wants to centralize power in Washington, D.C., then “I think part of that strategy is to overwhelm the system… and essentially make [these people] dependent on a central authority.”\nBut until the Democratic Party succeeds in trampling our entire system of government, they still have to follow the law.",
    "“And what the Biden administration is doing is — quite frankly — undermining it.” Worse, he argues, Biden is incentivizing lawlessness either indirectly by removing the consequences or directly by offering things like welfare benefits.",
    "We’ve gone in 50 years from John F. Kennedy wanting to put a man on the moon to Joe Biden wanting to put a felon in everyone’s neighborhood.”\nAnd, of course, the thing that really gets under Americans’ skin is the outright hypocrisy.",
    "The White House, determined to take sole ownership of the “worst administration ever” mantle, has decided to turn the catastrophe at the border up to doomsday levels by lifting the COVID restrictions that kept some migrants at bay.",
    "And what’s happening now, he explains, “is that people charged with serious crimes [and] convicted of serious crimes are just being released into our community… It is, quite frankly, making our country more dangerous.",
    "If Biden overturns Donald Trump’s Title 42, which allows the U.S. to turn away illegal immigrants because of the “communicable disease threat,” America is facing a nightmare of “cataclysmic” proportions, experts warn.",
    "Under Barack Obama, 1,000 people a day “overwhelm[ed] the system.” Anything over 4,000 was considered a “crisis.” So what does Joe Biden call 7,100 illegal border crossings every 24 hours?",
    "Like everyone else who sees the writing on the wall, they’re desperate to stop the Biden administration from removing the one remaining tool our border patrol has to stem the tide.",
    "According to documents, Homeland Security is preparing for 18,000 illegal encounters a day once the rule is overturned — double the record highs we’re seeing now.",
    "“Have you watched some of the footage of what goes on just on the other side of the border?” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) asked reporters.",
    "And it’s just unfair to hardworking American taxpayers.”\nThat’s what drove Brnovich — along with his counterparts in Missouri and Louisiana — to sue.",
    "Instead, in a pathetic attempt to please his open-borders radicals, Biden threw out every commonsense strategy that kept the problem under control.",
    "To states like Arizona, Texas, and California, “it’s throwing gasoline on a fire,” state Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R-Ariz.) shook his head.",
    "Starting May 23rd, agents warn, a million crossings every six months is going to sound like a dream scenario compared to what’s coming.",
    "And why is Congress considering a $10 billion package in COVID relief for a virus that the White House insists doesn’t exist anymore?",
    "If it goes, America could be staring down a literal stampede at the border, which is yet another storyline Democrats can’t afford.",
    "Moderates like Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) were more blunt about the “human tsunami” that awaits.",
    "But there’s nothing like an election to snap some sense into Biden’s party, who is suddenly desperate to save Title 42.",
    "We need assurances that we have security at the border and that we protect communities on this side of the border.",
    "“He’s not a dictator.” And if taking him to court is the only thing that will drive that point home, so be it.",
    "“This is not the right time,” he argued, “and we have not seen a detailed plan from the administration.",
    "Even extremists like Senator Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) raced to get on the record opposing Biden’s plan.",
    "Based on the best estimates, our agents have invoked Title 42 more than 1.7 million times since 2020.",
    "Americans wouldn’t be having this debate if Democrats had kept the ideas that were working in place.",
    "The borders of Biden’s authority are just as important as the country’s borders he ignores.",
    "If Democrats are declaring an end to the pandemic at the border, why not everywhere?",
    "Why are members of our military still forced to get vaccinated against their will?",
    "Immigrants want to come here because America cares about the rule of law, he said.",

    "EDITORS NOTE: This FRC-Action column is republished with permission.",
    "Obviously, the permanent solution to this crisis isn’t Title 42.",
    "If they want to change a policy, then there are rules for that.",
    "I mean, literally, the Democratic Party has gotten so Left.",
    "Why are passengers still required to wear masks on planes?",
    "“After all, [Biden’s] not a king,” Brnovich points out.",
    "It’s sound immigration policy that secures our border.",
    "But then, Brnovich wonders, maybe that was the point.",
    "Just the beginning, apparently.",
    "“It’s an insane policy.",
