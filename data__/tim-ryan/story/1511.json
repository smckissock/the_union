    "The announcement confirms speculation going back to October that Fisker would make the vehicle in partnership with Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn at the factory it bought from Lordstown Motors Corp.\nFisker CEO Henrik Fisker said at the time, “if Foxconn ends up acquiring Lordstown and if the deal closes, it’s our intent to make the PEAR with Foxconn in Lordstown.”\nThe plant sale for $230 million formally was announced in November.",
    "“This will enable us to both prove and refine the durability, connectivity and maneuverability of our vehicles as well as additional performance criteria for our fleet customers.”\nThe company announced in November it planned to make about 100 preproduction trucks.",
    "“With this partnership, we’re creating good-paying union jobs for Ohio workers, positioning the United States to lead the world in production of electric vehicles and batteries and ensuring that movement happens right here in Voltage Valley,” he said.",
    "“It’s an exciting vehicle and an exciting time for the company as we expand our lineup.”\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan said of Fisker’s announcement: “We are another step closer” to making the Mahoning Valley the nation’s hub for electric-vehicle production.",
    "Fisker also said in October because the PEAR is smaller than Lordstown Motors’ first vehicle, the Endurance truck, is assembled uniquely and will be assembled at a higher volume, it will require its own production line.",
    "In late January, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu told a Japanese news outlet that deliveries of the Endurance, Lordstown Motors’ flagship electric truck, will begin in the second half of 2022.",
    "He was hesitant to say then how much would be invested to retool the facility but did say Fisker’s agreement with Foxconn calls for the two companies to share the investment and profits.",
    "LORDSTOWN — Fisker Inc., the California-based manufacturer of electric vehicles, is accepting reservations for its second auto, the PEAR, which will be made in Lordstown.",
    "“Thanks to our collaboration with Foxconn, our preproduction vehicles are rolling out of assembly and into diverse testing environments,” the post states.",
    "The company will then host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. that can be accessed on the events pages of the Lordstown Motors’ investor relations website.",
    "Within a few days on Jan. 28, Lordstown Motors posted on social media a photo of Endurance trucks being assembled for preproduction.",
    "The PEAR (Personal Electric Automotive Revolution) is a compact, five-passenger urban electric vehicle, according to the company.",
    "Lordstown Motors plans to announce its fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 financial results before the market opens Feb. 28.",
    "“PEAR will feature the very latest technology in a beautifully designed, affordable urban mobility device,” Fisker said.",
    "Consumers can reserve the PEAR for $250 for the first reservation and $100 for the second reservation.",
    "Fisker’s comments came after Lordstown Motors and Foxconn announced they had a deal in principle.",
    "The company has targeted 250,000 units per year minimum for initial production.",
    "It has a base price of $29,900 before taxes and incentives.",
    "Deliveries will begin in 2024."
