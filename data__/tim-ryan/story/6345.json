    "In addition to trips down to Mar-a-Lago, the candidates and their affiliated super PACs have spent millions trying to paint one another as insufficiently loyal to the former president, who remains deeply popular with the GOP base, despite being impeached twice, and won the state in both 2016 and 2020.",

    "In an interview earlier this week, Vance told talk radio host Hugh Hewitt that he wasn’t sure whether Trump would end up endorsing in the race, but thought if he did it would come before Trump returns to the state for a rally on April 23.",

    "On Thursday night, dozens of Republican leaders in Ohio mounted a last-minute effort to urge Trump not to endorse Vance following a news report that said Trump was planning to do just that.",
    "He also wants to endorse a winner.”\nThe winner of the May 3 primary is likely to face Democratic frontrunner Ryan in November for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen.",
    "In a statement, Trump described Vance as “the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November.”\n“We cannot play games.",
    "But Vance has since changed his tune, saying he regrets his past comments.",
    "“He wants to endorse the person he thinks can beat Tim Ryan.",
    "I’m not sure that he will,” said Vance.",
