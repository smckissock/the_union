    "We made that agreement, it was a very hard agreement to make because we didn’t come out on top, but it was long-sighted in saying we’re going to do well.”\nAfter the agreement was announced in February 2021, a spokesman for Howmet said would invest at least $1.8 million in the next two years into the melt shop to add capacity and improve operations to position the plant for the market recovery and $2.4 million more in non-melt operations this year.",
    "“The idea of a 15 percent tariff was to protect American sponge manufacturers of which there aren’t any now, so we are going to continue to push to try to get rid of that tariff to the lower the cost of production for this business,” Ryan, D-Howland, said.",
    "WEATHERSFIELD — Howmet Aerospace has invested millions to upgrade and maintain its mill under an agreement struck with United Steelworkers in 2021 that cost the union jobs and some control over staffing, but saved the titanium melt shop there.",
    "The two-year contract extension allowed for some of the work to move to Canton, but the investment at the Weathersfield plant would make it competitive with the facility in Stark County, Thirion said at the time.",
    "The deal was for the company to make the capital investments at the Warren Avenue plant to drive down the cost to make titanium, making the plants more competitive and cost-effective.",
    "In exchange, USW Local 2155 agreed to management’s request to have more flexibility in contract language that allows Howmet to contract out work and with staffing in the melt shop.",
    "“A lot of that wraps back around to the agreement that we made that if we would have lost melt at our facility, I still believe to this day the Niles plant would have closed.",
    "Thirion was joined by other USW Local 2155 officials and Congressman Tim Ryan at the hall after touring the plant and speaking with operators and union members Monday.",
    "It was November 2020 when the company approached the union about shutting down the melt shop and moving the work to Michigan and Canton.",
    "Afterward, Ryan said an issue presenting the facility is a U.S. tariff on Japanese titanium sponge imports used in production.",
    "That deal is producing results, said Terry Thirion, Local 2155 president, with people returning to work and some expansion.",
    "Last year, the company invested about $4 million into the facility and about $5 million so far this year, he said.",
    "“And we’re trying to gain more investment still,” Thirion said Monday at the Local 2155 union hall in Niles.",
    "It resembles a raw gravel and is called sponge because of its porous texture.",
    "Sponge is the raw material used to start the titanium-making process.",
    "Contract language, however, prevented the move.",
    "The facility has 372 workers."
