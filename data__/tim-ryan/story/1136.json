    "Global rental companies could quickly scoop up a large chunk of inventory once the Pear rolls off the line, so the company decided to open reservations early based on the demand from consumers who expressed interest last year, he said.",
    "The Pear looks nothing like the Ocean, nothing like any vehicle in the world.”\nFisker’s strategy is to command market share in the affordable EV space, that is, electric vehicles priced below $50,000.",
    "Indeed, Fisker anticipates global demand in both the rental and consumer markets to be so strong that volume of the Pear could surpass one million units a year sometime after 2025, he told analysts.",
    "“Some of the features, some of the ways how you store things – it’s never been seen before.”\n“That’s not something we want to give away to the competition anytime soon, quite frankly,” Fisker said.",

    "Fisker plans to manufacture the Pear at Lordstown Motors Corp.’s 6.2 million-square-foot-plant – a massive assembly facility formerly owned by General Motors.",
    "In November, Fisker signed an agreement for the company to supply its EV batteries, while Foxconn is using CATL for its open-source platform.",
    "“Having already received over 1,000 reservations, I think the demand of 250,000 is easily going to be achieved,” Fisker said of the vehicle.",
    "“With Fisker’s announcement that the Pear will be ready for delivery in 2024, we are another step closer to making that a reality,” he said.",
    "Fisker said one advantage is that both Foxconn and Fisker have a working relationship with Chinese lithium-ion battery manufacturer CATL.",
    "“I’ve been fighting for the Mahoning Valley to be the nation’s hub of electric vehicle production for years,” Ryan said in a statement.",

    "At the same time, Fisker said the company had fielded requests for reservations last year when the Pear was first announced.",

    "U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-13, said the news is encouraging for the Mahoning Valley and its workforce.",
    "“Obviously, the Ohio factory gives us higher potential than that,” he told analysts.",
    "“This vehicle is so different in how it looks, how it’s going to function,” he said.",
    "That would mean using multiple factories over multiple continents, he said.",
    "“Over the next two years, this market share will be up for grabs,” he said.",
