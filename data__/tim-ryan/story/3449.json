    "The letter also took issue with the USPS’s environmental assessment process, noting that the agency issued the contract and committed $480 million toward engineering and factory construction before it began its review.",
    "“Electrification of only 10% of the postal service replacement vehicles over the next 10 years falls far short of our national goals for reducing GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions with deliberate speed,” the letter says.",
    "“EPA has determined that the final EIS lacks disclosure of important underlying information, contains serious deficiencies, and the Postal Service should not proceed to a decision,” the letter says.",
    "Cincinnati-based Workhorse Group, an EV manufacturer that once held an interest in Lordstown Motors Corp., was among a handful of companies that lost its bid for the contract last year.",
    "At the time, Ryan has particular questions over 524,000 shares of Oshkosh that were traded during after-hours on Feb. 22, just before the USPS announced the contract award on Feb. 23.",
    "Still, the decision to award the contract to Oshkosh drew the ire of Ohio lawmakers, who took issue with how DeJoy handled the selection process.",
