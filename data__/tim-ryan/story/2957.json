    "Moreno said the decision came after a private meeting with Donald Trump on Thursday which led to the agreement that “this race has too many Trump candidates and could cost the MAGA movement a conservative seat.”\nHe released the following statement:\n“I asked for a private meeting with President Trump this afternoon to discuss the state of the Ohio Senate race.",
    "To whomever wins the Senate race, I hope and pray they take the actions needed to stop illegal immigration, bring our manufacturing base back to America, and shrink the size and scale of the Federal Government.",
    "Joe Biden is the result of socialist policies infiltrating our institutions and the Senate is the stopgap to prevent Washington, DC from spiraling out of control.",
    "We must regain control of the United States Senate and eliminate the possibility of career DC politicians like Tim Ryan from representing Ohio.",
    "After talking to President Trump we both agreed this race has too many Trump candidates and could cost the MAGA movement a conservative seat.",
    "Bridget and I are deeply humbled and honored to have received the support of so many Ohioans including the endorsement from Clermont County.",
    "This race was never about fulfilling a personal ambition, but rather about serving the Country that gave me every opportunity to succeed.",
    "It’s not too much for Americans to expect their government work for them.”\nMoreno was one of nine Republicans running for the nomination.",
    "CLEVELAND — Businessman Bernie Moreno has ended his campaign for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate.",
    "I will focus my efforts on supporting the candidate that wins President Trump’s endorsement.",
    "This decision may surprise some, but it is what I feel gives us the best chance of success.",
    "Therefore, today I am ending my U.S. Senate campaign and will return to the private sector.",
    "Business leaders recognize patterns before they happen.",
    "I am a businessman, not a politician.",
    "The stakes are took high."
