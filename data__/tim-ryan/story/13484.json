    "The Ohio Democrat did not call for a no-fly-zone but instead broke sharply with the Biden administration and the Pentagon on the issue of supplying Ukraine’s air force with MiG-29 jets, which Mr Zelensky has requested as a concession if his request to close the airspace is not well-received.",

    "One establishment-aligned member of the GOP, Rep Tom Cole, talked to The Independent and described the scene as a “Churchillian” moment for Mr Zelensky, who has been transformed into a wartime leader after getting his start as a comedian and actor.",
    "Characterising the mood among other members, the Democrat described a feeling of “pride for what the United States has already provided” to Ukraine while noting that there was little political will for action that could “provoke World War Three”.",
    "“[What] we need to do is establish control of the air, which can be better done apparently by anti-aircraft missiles from the ground,” said Mr Nadler, referring to discussions he had engaged in with Ukrainian officials and their US counterparts.",
    "Mr Ryan flatly rejected arguments that the Pentagon have floated in recent days for advising against the sale of Polish jets to Ukraine, which US defence officials have claimed would not significantly boost Ukraine’s capabilities.",
    "One of the Democrats who appeared most affected by the speech was Rep Tim Ryan, a centrist Democrat and Senate candidate in Ohio who previously challenged Speaker Nancy Pelosi for leadership of the Democratic House caucus.",
    "Even some Republicans, who have watched conservative commentators and some members of their own caucus openly insult Mr Zelensky and his government, seemed impressed by the Ukrainian leader and the speech on Wednesday.",
    "There was little talk of acquiescing to Mr Zelensky’s main request for a no-fly-zone, but Democrats and Republicans alike who spoke to reporters after his speech clearly appeared to have been affected by his words.",

    "The lone exception was that of Rep Madison Cawthorn, a far-right purveyor of conspiracies who arrived extremely late to the event and only witnessed a minute or two of the president’s remarks.",
    "Members of the House praised the president’s speech and reacted to the shocking images of war displayed by Mr Zelensky’s team in a pre-produced media package that accompanied his address.",
    "Mr Ryan spoke to The Independent as his colleagues filed out of the early-morning gathering and called the images displayed to Congress by Mr Zelensky’s team “heartwrenching”.",
    "Of a no-fly-zone in particular, which experts have said could lead to a major US-Russia conflict, Ms Jayapal said that Mr Zelensky’s remarks had done little to move the dial.",
    "In general, the main effect of Wednesday’s address by Mr Zelensky appeared to be an emotional appeal to spur the next stage of US action in response to the invasion.",
