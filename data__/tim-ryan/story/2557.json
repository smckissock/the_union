    "It also speaks to this serious issue of double standards in our Department of Justice where if you are on the left and you engage in riotous behavior like what happened in the months leading up to the 2020 election, where the White House was under attack, monuments, statues, a federal courthouse was under nightly siege for months, businesses were looted, burned, many lives taken.",

    "And I think it also goes to the broader issue, Bret, that you are speaking about here, which is that crime is not only and issue that is touching a lot of people's lives, whether it's -- regardless of whether they're Republicans or Democrats, but from a political point of view.",
    "And I think it does complicate their narrative a little bit because there is an element of their party that remains extremely influential, especially in some of these cities that they still have to reckon with, and that's part of this conversation whether they like it or not.",
    "Let's bring in our panel to talk about this and other topics, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio, Mollie Hemingway, editor in chief of \"The Federalist,\" and Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters.",
    "Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Calhoun-Lopez's presentence filing said that Lee was in Minneapolis not to loot or destroy property but was in the streets to protest unlawful police violence against black men, and there is no basis to disbelieve his statement.\"",
    "HEMINGWAY: Well, we just keep hearing Biden administration officials saying that the science has changed, that they used to think that forced masking of children was scientifically great, and now the science has changed.",
    "And I think that we will probably hear him and others at the White House talk about the issue more going forward, because it will continue to be a potent political issue that Republicans will use against them.",
    "BAIER: Yes, and Jeff, there is this, from the Democratic point of view, even some moderates like Tim Ryan talking about the gun issue, and that seems to be where the White House ends up on the issue of crime.",
    "But do you think as we get closer to the election that the Biden administration seeing numbers go down, and hopefully they continue to, will use this liberty from mandates as a political issue?",
    "BAIER: I will give you a second here, Guy, but I think what Guy was pointing to was specific studies about schools and kids and threats to kids, and then other studies in recent months.",
    "JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"REUTERS\": Yes, and I don't presume that the DOJ hasn't responded to Senator Cotton's letter, or you no doubt would have played that response.",
    "BAIER: We have seen that in different states, including New Mexico where Biden won, where people are just saying that crime is one of the top issues that they are concerned about.",
    "You compare that to the riot on January 6th where they are not just throwing the book at the people who went into the Capitol, they are throwing every book at them.",
    "And when the Biden administration began, they put prominent defenders of the defund the police movement in the Department of Justice, Ms. Gupta and Ms. Clarke.",
    "But it does seem to solidify their argument about different places, distinct attorneys, and how the Department of Justice is dealing with different crimes.",
    "So as much as the White House would like to say yes, it's time to live normal lives, they are not going to say that when this many people continue to die.",
    "All right, tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, I will speak with South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about the Russia-Ukraine situation and China.",
    "And I do also think that the White House is sensitive to it, and that's one reason why President Biden went to New York last week to talk about crime.",
    "SEN. JONI ERNST, (R-IA): We see it with liberal district attorneys, progressive policies out there, that actually make it a crime to punish the crime.",
    "They eventually charged him with lighting that federal building on fire that led to the death, the killing, as Senator Cotton mentioned, of one man.",
    "Big win, though, today in Virginia where Glenn Youngkin's position actually came up for a vote, for parental choice on masking in the state Senate.",
    "BAIER: I want to just talk, Guy, for a second about the two standards on mask mandates and what we are seeing around the country already happening.",
    "I think they would be smart to draw some of those contrasts with their State of the Union Address response, for example, at the beginning of March.",
    "And so people see that difference, and they look at that and they know that the country can't withstand two standards of justice like we have now.",
    "And that's something that the Biden administration continues to push because the science shows that wearing mask does prevent the spread of COVID.",
    "In a nearly evenly divided chamber, that's not just a win for Youngkin politically, who seems to have, perhaps, read the room better than others.",
    "But back in the campaign, you'll that anti-law enforcement sentiments was all the rage literally on the left and within the Democratic Party.",
    "First, we have DANP who asks, \"What will be the U.S. reaction if China sends troops to support Russia under the guise of military exercises?\"",
    "But they are clinging on to these insane CDC standards that are anti-science, frankly, on this issue, and certainly harmful to children.",
    "MASON: I think, number one, I would just like to push back a little bit on what Guy said, which is that it's anti-science to wear mask.",
    "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Criminal justice reform has had some broad bipartisan appeal in recent years.",
    "And it wasn't that long ago, a few days ago, that Jen Psaki was expressing bafflement about, what does soft on crime really mean?",
    "And I'm not putting words in your mouth, Guy, but the deleterious effects of socializing and education on kids from masks, fair?",
    "I do think Democrats, I think you were right to say, will come back by saying a big part of the issue here has to do with guns.",
    "And they get indignant in the administration when there is any suggestion that perhaps they themselves are also soft on crime.",
    "We mentioned this the other night, but there are now four or five Democratic run states that are changing their mask mandates.",
    "BAIER: Jeff, obviously COVID has killed a lot of people around our country, and it has been horrific over the past two years.",
    "And they have had this long campaign of installing district attorneys who do not prosecute, in some cases, violent crimes.",
    "The Biden administration would love to move on from this pandemic just as all of us would love to move on from pandemic.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBAIER: But this specific case obviously deals with the DOJ and what it's choosing to do, Jeff.",
    "It's also a win for children, and I think we might see similar bills introduced, we ought to, in other states.",
    "But that's not where the White House is right now, and that disparity is creating the political wedge as well.",
    "BAIER: Crime is a big issue across the country, big cities, really in different places throughout our country.",
    "And parents are rising up and saying you have got to stop forcing the masking of children against our wishes.",
    "As we head towards the November elections, does this change yet again, or is this a powerful political issue?",
    "Mike asks, \"Bret, it's my understanding you played in the recent AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament.",
    "\"The judge goes below guidelines, gives 10-year term to man who set deadly Lake Street fire during unrest.",
    "My point is about the evidence of masking children in schools preventing the transmission among students.",
    "They haven't seemed very interested in prosecuting any of these things or really investigating them.",
    "And I get it, because Joe Biden, of course, was the author of a very harsh crime bill in the 90s.",
    "BAIER: All right, and we will cover that, State of the Union March 1st right here in Washington.",
    "Kamala Harris tweeted out support for a fund to bail violent rioters and others out of jail.",

    "I go back to gray and blue, which is why I get a little crazy on the golf pants outside.",
    "The best shows are changed about six times, which are most shows, right before the show.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nREP. TIM RYAN, (D-OH): My God, all the things going on in the cities.",
    "But that's a good question and one that foreign policy experts don't have an answer to.",
    "And Biden and Harris felt the need to keep the base on side and pander to those folks.",
    "And, jeff, to your point, the Biden administration doesn't want to get ahead of that.",
    "They are going to come around to the political necessity of their party soon enough.",

    "BAIER: OK, Mollie, thoughts on all of this and kind of where we stand.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nBAIER: Left of the tree, which is a great experience.",
    "That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.",
    "That would be a big problem, and it would throw a wrench into things.",
    "It's also one where Republicans see weakness on the Democratic side.",
    "Biden, for example, endorsed redirecting funds away from the police.",
    "The Democrats took that and went extremely far, as Guy pointed out.",
    "So Republicans, I think they sense some wind at their back on this.",
    "As Guy references, we haven't seen much difference in recent weeks.",
    "Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.",
    "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nBAIER: It's Tuesday, time for \"Tuesday Tweets.\"",

    "The science is not -- it's not anti-science to wear mask.",
    "The pants are a little much, as I look back at the video.",
    "If this doesn't change, the whole thing could come back.",
    "There is no strong scientific evidence to support that.",
    "But of course, this case that you referred to does not.",
    "This case, obviously Republicans are commenting on it.",
    "And this is not something that people find appealing.",
    "The Department of Justice has gone very easy on that.",
    "GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Right.",
    "What are they even talking about over on FOX News?",

    "That is something that she put on personal feed.",
    "Take a listen to this blame game back and forth.",

    "What are those consequences?",
    "That's a form of defunding.",
    "Guy, let me start with you.",
    "It evolves through the day.",
    "It's an amazing tournament.",
    "Here is teeing off on 18.",
    "That's not actually true.",
    "And it was a lot of fun.",
