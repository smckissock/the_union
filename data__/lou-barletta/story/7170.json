    "\"McCormick has a strong base of support across most demographics that increases when undecided voters are asked who they lean toward, compared to Oz who seems to lack a clear base, and sees less growth than McCormick, Bartos, or Barnette,\" wrote Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, in a statement Thursday.",
    "While Dr. Mehmet Oz is within the margin of error for the lead in Emerson College's Pennsylvania Senate GOP primary poll, the very likely undecided voters are siding heavily with David McCormick.",

    "\"Barletta also leads all age groups except those aged 50-64, where Mastriano holds 29% of this age bloc's support.\"",
