    "Oz, a 61-year-old Ohio native who attended medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, announced his senate run in November and has used his medical credentials to largely campaign on a platform criticizing COVID-19 mandates.",
    "In 2014, Oz testified before the U.S. Congress over allegations that he promoted sham \"miracle\" diet products while a British Medical Journal study found half of his medical advice was false or incorrect.",
    "In his endorsement, Trump noted that Oz is \"pro-life\" and \"very strong on crime\" and other issues of concern to the former president including the border and false claims of widespread election fraud.",

    "Trump had initially endorsed Sean Parnell for the seat but Parnell dropped out of the race after claims he abused his estranged wife, Politico noted.",
    "The former president said in the statement that his endorsement of Oz was \"about winning elections in order to stop the Radical Left maniacs.\"",
    "\"He even said that I was in extraordinary health, which made me like him even more (although he also said I should lose a couple of pounds!).\"",
    "Oz also has ties to Trump, who appointed him to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition in 2018 and 2020.",
    "Trump's endorsement was revealed Saturday night in a statement by his spokeswoman Liz Harrington in a post made to Twitter.",
    "\"I have known Dr. Oz for many years, as have many others, even if only through his very successful television show.",
