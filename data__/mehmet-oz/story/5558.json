    "“The first growl in that clip is like hearing the sound of a cranky lawnmower you know is about to sexually harass you.”\nOliver has been critical of both Oz’s medical advice and political campaign in the past, and Sunday turned his attention to the “daytime snake-oil carnival,” calling it “a shit show” and mocking Oz’s attempts to relate to the everyman by posting TikToks of himself at the gas pump and produce aisle, bemoaning high prices and blaming current President Joe Biden.",
    "He ran through recent Oz videos and critiqued them, saying, “For a man who’s made a career out of talking into a camera, it is amazing how bad he’s been at doing that during this campaign.”\nThe Last Week Tonight offices are across the hall from the former offices for Oz’s daytime talk show, which he shuttered to run for Senate.",
    "The staff of Oliver’s show set up a large inflatable alligator genteelly presenting a middle finger to the office suite, which they recently updated with a message in case any of Oz’s staff stopped by to pick up their belongings this week: “I’m sorry, he seems like a fucking nightmare.”",
    "“That means people like you.” He called Oz “a great guy.”\nJohn Oliver disagreed with that assessment on Sunday night’s Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, ripping into the endorsement and Oz’s overall campaign in an energetic rant on the streaming late night talk show.",
    "Oliver pointed out Oz’s $100 million-plus personal fortune and theorized that he was posting the videos to push older clips, like one of him wakesurfing in Italy to a soundtrack of “My Life Be Like,” further down his page.",
    "The former president and longtime reality TV personality stepped in recently to endorse Dr. Mehmet Oz, another erstwhile reality personality, in his Republican bid for a Pennsylvania Senate seat.",
    "Benjamin Franklin said that the only certainties in life are death and taxes, but recent election cycles may have added another item to that list: Donald Trump commenting on things.",
    "In short, Oliver said, Oz is “fucking rich,” making his attempts to connect with voters over inflation laughable, according to Oliver.",
    "“What he doesn’t get to do is stand in front of gas pumps and pretend he’s personally affected by those numbers,” Oliver said.",
    "“I haven’t heard [Trump’s] voice in a while and to be honest, I haven’t really missed it,” he said.",
    "“When you’re on television for 18 years, that’s like a poll,” Trump said."
