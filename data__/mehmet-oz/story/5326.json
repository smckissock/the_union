    "A New York Supreme Court judge ruled that New York City cannot void the golf course contract with Trump Organization, saying former mayor Bill de Blasio was interpreting the contract in a way not as written.",
    "But de Blasio officials changed course and stated that the city was canceling the contract because Trump Organization was incapable of attracting professional tournament quality events to the Ferry",
    "The de Blasio administration notified Trump Organization on Jan. 15, 2021, that they were terminating the company’s license for a golf course in Throgs Neck of the Bronx borough.",
    "The city initially claimed that the Jan. 6 event at the Capitol was the reason behind this decision."
