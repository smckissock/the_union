    "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think the most damning information is contained on page 30 of this 108 page lawsuit which is very well-crafted legally, and that is that on a very specific date, July 26, 2016, Hillary Clinton approved a plan presented to her by one of her foreign policy advisers to falsely accuse Donald Trump and frame him of conspiring or colluding with the Russians to influence the election, all the while knowing that it was a lie.",
    "I think this can -- this holds people accountable because we've not gotten the answers as to how a dirty Russian disinformation dossier purchased by Hillary Clinton and money she used with the DNC as well, was used -- it is a document that can never be verified, four phony FISA applications approved, Christopher Steele and the sub- source admitting it was all bunk and yet they continued to spy on the president through Carter Page.",
    "HANNITY: And when you see entire cities like Mariupol decimated, hospitals bombed out, maternity hospitals, schools bombed out, indiscriminate bombing of innocent men, women and children, and you see women and children shot dead, bombed out in the streets, and the cities of Ukraine, does America at least have a moral obligation to assist a country that's willing to fight for itself to defend their natural rights?",
    "GABBARD: So am I, so am I.\nHANNITY: But what you see with your own eyes -- what you see with your own eyes, and what we're showing every night, is there a moral obligation and is it wise and strategically beneficial to the world and including the United States to stop this, this megalomaniac, murdering thug right here right now with the Ukrainians willing to fight if they only have the weapons?",
    "Tonight, we are more than one month into Putin's bloody invasion into Ukraine and yet Russia's murdering thug has almost nothing to show for his efforts, except a lot of dead soldiers, faltering economy, blood all over his hands because of the brutal, indiscriminate bombings that have destroyed hospitals, and schools, entire cities and neighborhoods, almost the entire city of Mariupol.",

    "So I was happy to see Alina and her co-counsel file a racketeering case against Hillary Clinton and her cronies and more than a dozen other people who were involved, including government officials like James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page because this was and she presents all the necessary predicates for a racketeering case.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I had no intention of running for president again and until I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Virginia carrying torches and carrying Nazi banners and literally singing the same vile rhyme that they used in Germany in the early `20s or `30s I should say.",
    "That's why our country is in the mess that we're in because people who run for office, they look at it as a job or as a business, instead of as a calling, as something that they know that they are wired to do, they're passionate about and they're willing to do whatever it takes to get in there and do the right thing.",
    "GABBARD: I think that -- I think the most responsible thing that our leaders, the United States, leaders of NATO, Ukraine and Russia need to do right now is look at what the reality is, that we are facing on the ground and the reality the world is facing and competitive being able to negotiate an outcome to this.",
    "I would imagine, there are some Democrats who are very concerned about her giving a three-month sentence to a convicted child sex predator who had dozens of graphic images on his computer and then six years later, he comes back in front of her again and she gives him six months in a halfway house.",

    "Have you gathered specific intelligence that suggests that President Putin is deploying these weapons, moving into position or considering their use, and would the U.S. or NATO respond with military action if he did use chemical weapons?",
    "Very few people, including myself, thought that they would be able to hold out for more than a few days and now there is a distinct possibility if they get the proper support, they could actually win this war against Russia and Putin.",
