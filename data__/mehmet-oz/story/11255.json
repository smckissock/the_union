    "Senators to keep his dual citizenship with Turkey.https://t.co/AGbzpLEmmP pic.twitter.com/GOtnANUC8b\n— Sy Snyder (@PoliticsPA) March 16, 2022\nHere's a story about his candidacy from November of last year:\nDr. Oz's prospective campaign for an open Senate seat in Pennsylvania remains a hush-hush affair — no one so far has admitted to working on it and the consultants thought to be involved are remaining tight-lipped https://t.co/r3QG04Ajvn\n— POLITICO (@politico) November 19, 2021\nOne commenter on Twitter said\nDr. Oz is buying a house in Pennsylvania.",
    "Apparently he's planning on carrying his Turkish dual citizenship into the Senate, even if it means that he won't have a Senator's security clearance:\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz said today that he would forego certain security clearances that are provided to all U.S.",
    "When you swear your oath of allegiance in the US—and I've done it—you swear to “abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen.” But it's a joke.",
    "As a child, Oz not only spent summers in Turkey, but kept up his Turkish citizenship by doing by doing his obligatory (for Turkish citizens) military service: he spent two years in the Turkish army after college.",
    "When he was in Parris Island, we got a call, which is unheard of—you usually never hear from them from the moment they get there until they get out, you see them at the graduation ceremony.",
    "Here's something Peter Brimelow said in a speech to the John Randolph Club in Cleveland in 2015:\nAnother aspect of reorganizing the nation: the redefinition of the political community.",
    "Here he is being funny on Craig Ferguson's program in TKYEAR\nHe's also a Republican primary candidate for United States Senator from Pennsylvania...and Turkish dual citizen.",
    "Well, whether the Senate should also be an \"unusual section of American society\" it should definitely be a section of American society, not Turkish society.",
    "Oz was born in 1960 in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of a Turkish doctor who was a resident at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.",
    "Not as a political statement, by the way—I don’t have any compunction about him getting the passports, because I don't make these laws.",
    "Whether Oz is a good guy or a bad guy, he's obviously not a loyal American, and not, it doesn't matter if Turkey is in NATO or not.",
    "It's not enforced, because of a Supreme Court decision to accommodate some Israeli who wanted to retain his American passport.",
    "He said: \"Sir, until recently, having a foreign parent would have disqualified him from going into intelligence.\"",
    "His full name is Mehmet Cengiz Öz, which means that he's named after the Prophet Mohammed and Genghis Khan.",
    "Well, that's how Hillary Clinton became Senator from New York, and I doubt if it's the only such case.",
    "He said: if he has a British or Canadian passport, he's not eligible to serve in Marine intelligence.",
    "[Afroyim v. Rusk, 1967]\nThat could also, of course, be halted by statute, and it should be halted.",
    "by Peter Brimelow\nDr. Mehmet Oz, \"Dr. Oz\" for short is a real doctor, and TV doctor as well.",
    "He was also looking for a Canadian passport, because Alexander’s late mother was Canadian.",
    "22 years earlier: INSIGHT Debate: Does Dual Citizenship Erode American National Identity?",
    "But the Marines are a somewhat unusual section of American society [Laughter].",
    "But Alexander’s MOS [Military Occupation Specialty] was intelligence.",
    "Well, as a matter of fact, Alexander didn't have these passports.",
    "And the sergeant wanted to know: did he have a British passport?",
    "My son, as some of you know, was, until very recently, a Marine.",
    "Rich people parachuting in to states they don't live in.",
    "Definitely how our political process is meant to work.",
    "But I just hadn't gotten around to organizing it.",
    "Something has to be done about dual citizenship.",
    "I said: \"Well, they are NATO allies, you know.\"",
    "He went straight in after high school.",
    "Now, some Americans are aware of this.",
    "So the sergeant said that was fine.",
    "So there is some awareness.",
    "Yes!"
