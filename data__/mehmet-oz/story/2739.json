    "On Monday, Oz tweeted a link to a news article about his recent visit to northwestern Pennsylvania, where he said at a campaign stop that “China is coming after us.” McCormick tweeted a link the same day to a Breitbart story that trumpeted “Exclusive — Republican Candidate David McCormick Calls for ‘Whole Nation Strategy’ to Combat Chinese Influence.”\nA pro-Oz super PAC, American Leadership Action, has aired a TV ad that said McCormick “led a hedge fund with a billion-dollar Chinese investment program,” “called China our ally” and “criticized President Trump’s China policy.” A spot by Oz’s campaign said that “Wall Street outsourced your jobs to China” and called for “leaders with the courage to fight.”\nThe attack ad by Oz bashing McCormick, which is airing in the Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Wilkes-Barre and Johnstown media markets, said “China sent us Covid, then David McCormick’s hedge fund gave Chinese companies billions — we got sick, China got investments, and David McCormick got rich.”\nSam Sutton contributed to this report.",
    "“This should be a model for other U.S. companies, unlike David McCormick’s track record of exporting jobs to China and India from the dark corners of Wall Street.”\nIn reference to Oz’s connections to China, McCormick campaign spokesperson Jess Szymanski told POLITICO: “Mehmet Oz — citizen of Turkey, creature of Hollywood — has spent the last 20 years making his fortune from syndicating his show in China, enriching itself through censorship and CCP propaganda,” and that “while Mehmet has been silent on China until he needed to knock down Dave’s credentials, Dave was serving our country and standing up to the [Chinese Communist Party].”\nIn its 2020 annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Usana said that China was its “largest market and single largest source of revenue,” making up around 41 percent of net sales and about 38 percent of its active customers.",
    "While McCormick warned of China’s rise back in 2006, he also previously made sympathetic comments about the country, saying in a 2007 speech at Peking University, “When China succeeds, the United States succeeds.”\nHe talked about the “admiration” America had about what China had achieved as well, praising the “remarkable success of China’s economic development over the last three decades.” And in an ironic twist, Bridgewater, while McCormick was still at the firm, owned $3.2 million worth of shares of Usana as of last September, although as a hedge fund, it was not a direct investor in the company but has exposure through indexes to many stocks around the world.",
    "He kicked off his campaign with an op-ed in Fox Business titled “Time for America’s leaders to confront China’s Communist Party head on,” in which he said he was so aggressive during his time as a Treasury official that “top Chinese leaders appealed to the president of the United States to soften the technology controls I put in place.” He also distanced himself from his former business partner Ray Dalio’s controversial comments about the country, which appeared to minimize China’s human rights record.",
    "In a 2021 promotional video for his book called “Yin Yang You: Biohacking with Ancient Codes,” Oz talked about how he has “teamed up with Usana for over a decade to journey around the world seeking out the very best science to help you live better and longer.” In the video, Oz lavishly praises Usana and said its “global efforts to seek out health solutions knows no bounds” and that he had a chance to study with “world-renowned” traditional Chinese medicine doctors.",
    "Empowering people is much different than McCormick raising money to benefit the Chinese Communist Party.”\nUsana, a publicly traded company, was investigated by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission several years ago over whether its operations in China complied with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from paying bribes overseas.",

    "The revelations about Oz’s China connections come after he hit McCormick with a new attack ad last week calling his opponent “China’s friend, not ours.” Oz is the first candidate in Pennsylvania’s GOP primary, one of the most expensive and important Senate contests in the country, to go negative on TV, though super PACs have been slinging mud in the race for months.",

    "A 2018 annual report by Usana filed with the SEC stated that the company’s partnership with Oz’s TV show “has focused on our North America region historically” but “now focuses on China” as well.",
    "Last November, when McCormick was CEO of Bridgewater, the hedge fund raised a new Chinese investment fund, its third, making the firm one of the top foreign managers of private money in China.",

    "Dr. Oz is a highly respected physician, and we enjoyed our collaboration with both him and The Dr Oz Show over the last several years.”\nAsked about the CCTV interviews, Yanick said, “Dr.",
    "Oz’s negative spot against McCormick is a reference to his former company, Bridgewater Associates, which manages $5 billion for China, including money for China’s sovereign wealth fund.",
    "The fact that Oz has exposure on his own relationship with China could give McCormick an opportunity to muddy the waters and make it more difficult for Oz to land a blow on his rival.",
    "“Usana is a publicly traded American company that manufactures products in the U.S. for American consumers and manufactures products in China for that market,” Yanick said.",
    "Oz, however, has performed poorly in straw polls of members of Pennsylvania’s Republican Party, which will determine this weekend whether to endorse in the Senate contest.",
