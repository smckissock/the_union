    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \"wasn't taking advice from doctors\" during the pandemic, so it made little sense to take its advice on schools from the teachers' unions, television's Dr. Mehmet Oz, a GOP candidate for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, said Thursday on Newsmax.",
    "She's been a target of many Republicans after taking office because of statements she's made about the COVID-19 virus and the importance of vaccinations after she said in an interview a year ago that people who get shots won't transmit COVID-19.",
    "Oz also commented on the growing number of major media companies now covering the Hunter Biden laptop scandal and said that he thinks many of them should retract what they said about former President Donald Trump in connection with the matter.",
    "I think one of the reasons the White House finally, after three efforts, three different explanations, fired me yesterday from the President's Council of Sports, Fitness and Nutrition that President Trump had put me on.\"",
    "Oz also said the pharmaceutical companies are pushing for vaccinations for children under the age of 6, and while he doesn't want to talk parents out of their decision, \"my grandchildren are not getting vaccinated.\"",
    "CDC Director Rochelle Walensky is under fire after reports that teachers' unions and the CDC coordinated policies to determine school closing requirements, with several Republicans calling for her resignation.",
    "And when it comes to getting a second booster shot, Oz said it's up to the individual, but he won't be getting his second shot.",
    "\"It turns out that getting vaccinated does reduce severe disease but it does not appear to reduce the spread that much.\"",
    "\"We know that schools were kept closed far beyond what made scientific sense, Oz said on Newsmax's \"John Bachman Now.\"",
    "\"It doesn't make sense for most people,\" he said, as they don't have comorbidities or major risk factors involved.",
    "\"Twitter and major media outlets literally blocked this Hunter Biden story,\" said Oz.",
    "It also reflects the left's desire not to allow other opinions to be played out.",
    "\"It was wrong, and it was predictably going to be wrong,\" said the doctor.",
    "\"But again, when you mix science with medicine, you know what you get?",
    "\"I actually know the shop where that computer was left.",
    "You mix science with politics, you get politics.",
    "You get great medicine.",
    "That's what they got.\"",
    "It's stunning to me.",
