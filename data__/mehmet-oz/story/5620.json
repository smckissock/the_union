    "Rest assured, the top performer will be taking the snaps on opening day.”\nThis sounds hauntingly like a dreaded “public vote of confidence,” the always half-hearted false assurance of job security that most athletes not named Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers receive from coaches at the opening of training camp a half a year after the completion of the previous mediocre season where the team missed the playoffs -- again.",
    "It's a formal way of saying, “you’re no more valuable to us than a piece of cordwood and you’re getting the boot unless you step it up and produce.”\nA similar phenomenon could be taking place in today’s Republican party where prospects look especially bright for a takeover of the majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives after this year’s midterm elections.",
    "The Oz thing along with some other questionable endorsements have some people scratching their heads and wondering whether Trump has lost some of his mojo since he rode down the escalator at Trump Tower (in June, 2015) and immediately launched his stunning assault on the Washington establishment, a salvo of truth that still resounds to this day.",
    "A perfect storm of inflation, vexing foreign policy dilemmas, a catastrophe-in-the-making at the southern border, an overdose of “woke” cultural serum, the confirmation of a pedophile protecting Supreme Court nominee and the ongoing overhyped saga of COVID-19 have all combined to leave American voters in a historically bad mood.",
    "Trump is not exactly akin to the faltering starting quarterback described above who’s about to be traded or dumped onto the waiver wire, but with things having gotten pretty bad in the country since he left office, voters are no longer willing to settle for a leader who can’t proverbially win games for them.",
    "There’s a growing sentiment that it might not be the greatest outlook for Trump to run again in 2024, or at the very minimum, to ensure he’s tested in the GOP primaries by a slate of Republican candidates who will force him to bring his best “game” to every opportunity to demonstrate his abilities.",
    "As of now, Donald Trump is our “starting presidential candidate” but there should be a competition for what amounts to the most consequential election in our lifetimes, and rest assured, the top performer -- and vote getter -- will have his or her name on the ballot on Election Day.",
    "It typically involves a highly paid quarterback who everyone was formerly excited about but hasn’t panned out the way he was expected to do and the team’s exasperated front office is ready to overtly concede that if the signal caller doesn’t cut it this year, he’s history.",
    "But it almost seems like the unabashed Trump of those times has been influenced and changed by his years in the swamp, to the point where he’s lending his name and endorsement to a TV doctor hack who’s spoken up for gun control, abortion “rights” and transgender causes.",
    "I’m not personally familiar with the intricate details of the Keystone State’s candidates, but Oz himself has articulated a number of weak-kneed liberal issue positions on his show over the years, lending the impression that he harbors latent big government biases.",
    "Trump does appear to be seeking a “coronation” in the primaries by suggesting that all of his potential competitors will -- or should -- clear the field once he gives the official word that he’s all-in for his Trump campaign barnstorming tour, part three.",
    "Schlichter was quick to highlight how much he admires Trump and would enthusiastically back him in the general election (Kurt didn’t say who he would vote for in the primary) if the New York outsider successfully runs the gauntlet like he did in 2016.",
    "Joe Biden economy\nDemocrat welfare bill\nBuild Back Better\n13 House Republicans Infrastructure bill\nKyrsten Sinema\nJoe Manchin\nRINOs\nMarjorie Taylor Green\nKevin McCarthy\nMitch McConnell\n2022 elections\nDonald Trump\n2024 presidential election",
    "Through forces not entirely related to the party itself, GOPers are enjoying a wave of positive feelings towards them so they may act as potential saviors from the ravages of senile president Joe Biden’s awful administration.",
    "Schlichter mentioned former Trump secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Texas senator (and 2016 runner-up to Trump) Ted Cruz as individuals he’d like to see engage in a battle of policies and gravitas with Trump himself.",
    "Many, many conservatives have commented on this particular race since it’s considered vital to the GOP’s prospects for both retaining a critically important seat and also gaining a majority in the upper chamber.",
    "In a piece titled, “If You Like Donald Trump Then You Want a Real Primary,” The always inimitable conservative bomb thrower Kurt Schlichter wrote at Townhall:\n“You can't be a kingmaker if you can't make kings.",
    "Schlichter was correct in asserting that it would make Trump produce “on the field” but would also provide a forum for others to “show what they’ve got” when the nomination is on the line.",
    "Polls show they have almost no confidence in the present regime to make things better, either, so naturally a great deal of attention is shifting towards who might come after senile Joe.",
    "The California conservative was particularly put off by Trump’s recent decision to endorse TV doctor Mehmet Oz in the upcoming (May 17) Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senate primary.",
    "But one also senses conservatives are edgy about the notion of placing all of their eggs in one basket for a controversy-magnet who will be 78 years old on Election Day in 2024.",
    "It's often said that a day is like a lifetime in politics, and there are a lot of sunrises and sunsets between now and whenever the GOP primary season unofficially kicks off.",
    "This is a nice wish -- that the Republican Party is now so united behind him that it wouldn’t even consider picking someone else -- but is it realistic?",
    "He'll win some, but at this rate, he'll lose a bunch – PA conservatives are not going to vote for a lib in cons clothing just because Trump says to.",
    "You may recall there were a couple non-serious contenders (Mark Sanford and Bill Weld) challenging him in 2020, but neither of them got very far.",
    "Not only would such a display be wildly entertaining, it would help everyone in the party sharpen their understanding and articulation of issues.",
    "DeSantis is getting arguably more publicity than Trump these days, and it’s almost all positive from a Republican primary voter’s standpoint.",
    "At the very least, Oz appears to be a Johnny-come-lately to the cause of liberty on firearms, abortion, government dictates on COVID, etc.",
    "Leaving aside that none of them defended him in print or fought for election integrity, they are simply enabling Trump's worst instincts.",
    "At least a few of them, such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have demonstrated that they deserve a chance to compete for the position.",
    "Winning a senate majority would theoretically stall or halt all of senile Joe’s leftist ideologue court and administration nominees.",
    "Maybe Ted Cruz will hit Trump as hard as he's been hitting the libs lately (Cruz's speech on the pedo-tolerating KBJ was legendary).",
    "It’s hard to recall now, but Trump’s had lots of head-scratching political statements in his time and evolved quite a bit himself.",
    "It’s one that Schlichter has made before -- several times -- and was just as well-reasoned the last time as he was in this one.",
    "This kind of error squanders his mystique and makes him look weak and vulnerable...\n“A primary will sharpen him and test him.",
    "“As of now, he’s our starting quarterback, but I want everyone to know that there will be fierce competition for the job.",
    "If Trump was convinced that Oz was on the level, one is tempted to give the former president the benefit of the doubt.",
    "Who knows, perhaps Oz has experienced a Trump-like epiphany and genuinely supports what he claims to believe in 2022.",
    "By the looks of it, Trump likely was cheated out of legitimate legal recourse if not the election result itself.",
    "Maybe Ron DeSantis, his wife thankfully cancer-free, steps up and takes it...\n“If you dig Trump, do him a favor.",
    "and folks like Schlichter maintain he can’t be trusted to hold firm on the Make America Great Again agenda.",
    "The “competition” will do Trump good, even if he might see challengers as a blow to his stature and ego.",
    "Hopefully we’ll find out if Republicans regain control of Congress and delve deeply into the mystery.",
    "It could be said that he learned everything he knows from Trump, but that’s a good thing, isn’t it?",
    "In other words, it’s a big prize and will have a tangible impact on everyone’s daily lives.",
    "There were more than enough serious irregularities to merit a thorough investigation.",
    "The young Floridian has become “the” rising star in conservative Republican politics.",
    "2024 should not be a coronation for Trump -- or any other candidate, for that matter.",
    "Besides, Trump met with the man before issuing his endorsement.",
    "A lot of his endorsements are easy, with obvious, sure winners.",
    "And he needs a war to be his best.”\nA convincing argument, no?",
    "Now, plenty of Trump fans will be furious about this column.",
    "Maybe we will see Pompeomania ignite the base's imagination.",
    "Much of that focus shines on former president Donald Trump.",
    "Demand he earns what he seeks instead of handing it to him.",
    "In total, did they add up to a reversal of the result?",
    "But he's not cutting it with the harder endorsements.",
    "But Schlichter’s greater point is also well taken.",
    "Regardless, Trump should face a primary test.",
    "His bad decisions risk devaluing his brand.",
    "DeSantis’s popularity is only rising.",
    "But what happened, happened in 2020.",
    "There are others as well.",
    "It’s that important.",
    "Trump is a fighter.",
    "And maybe he fails.",
    "Demand excellence.",
    "Don't coddle him.",
    "He is a warrior.",
    "Time will tell."
