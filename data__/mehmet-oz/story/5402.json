    "The Motion Picture Academy’s decision to ban Will Smith from Oscar ceremonies and events for 10 years as discipline for slapping Chris Rock is little more than an extended time out for a playground bully.",
    "He needs to come to grips with the gravity of the offense he committed: slapping Rock, live on March 27 in front of millions on the Academy Awards stage.",
    "Smith needs to express-mail his golden trophy back to the Academy and publicly state something to the effect of: “Out of respect",
    "At this point, the only person who can redeem the integrity of the Oscars is Smith himself.",
    "It’s a toothless penalty that lays bare the shallowness of Hollywood morals."
