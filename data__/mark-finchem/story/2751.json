Bret Roberts of Maricopa, Rep. Kevin Payne of Peoria, Rep. Mark Finchem of Oro Valley, Sen. David Farnsworth of Mesa, Sen. Sonny Borrelli of Lake Havasu City, Rep. Leo Biasiucci, of Lake Havasu City, Rep. Anthony Kern of Glendale, Rep. David Cook of Globe, Sen. Sylvia Allen of Snowflake, Rep. John Fillmore of Apache Junction, Sen. Nancy Barto of Phoenix, Rep.

    "An unconstitutional opportunity for Democrats to get “the personal telephone numbers, IP addresses, file names of attachments, and contact details of the party members most in communication with the state chair of the party at a time when the legitimacy of the last presidential election was in dispute.”\n“As such,” the Wards' lawsuit contends, “the Subpoena provides the Committee with the means to chill the First Amendment associational rights not just of the Plaintiffs but of the entire Republican Party in Arizona.”\nThat’s something she and her fellow Republicans might have wanted to think about before they tried to steal an election.",
    "Meanwhile, 29 Republican state legislators – including several just elected but not yet seated – would sign a three-page “Joint Resolution of the 54th Legislature” asking Congress to accept the 11 “alternate” electoral votes for Trump or “to have all electoral votes nullified completely until a full forensic audit can be conducted.”\nThe document, dated Dec. 14 and written on letterhead with the official state seal, was circulated by Sen. Kelly Townsend, now a candidate for Congress and addressed to Vice President Mike Pence.",
    "“The disclosure required by the Subpoena,” her attorney writes, “does not relate to a sufficiently important government interest because there has been no link, alleged or otherwise, between the events of the January 6th attack on the Capitol the Committee was formed to investigate, and the Plaintiffs.”\nDoes not relate to a sufficiently important government interest?",
    "Also concurring: Sen. David Gowan of Sierra Vista, outgoing Rep. Bob Thorpe of Flagstaff, Reps. Jacqueline Parker of Mesa, Brenda Barton of Payson, Beverly Pingerelli of Peoria, Joseph Chaplik of Scottsdale, Jake Hoffman of Queen Creek, Judy Burges of Skull Valley, Quang Nguyen of Prescott Valley and Sen. Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff.",
    "So now, it’s all coming out and suddenly Ward – the woman who a year ago thought it was akin to sacrilege for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to question a state Senate subpoena for ballots – is running to court to quash a subpoena issued by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.",
    "The Wards, Senate candidate Jim Lamon and eight other Trump supporters – people who would have been empowered to cast Arizona’s electoral votes had their candidate won – were to meet on Dec. 14, 2020, the same day the state's actual electors were meeting.",
    "Arizona Republican Party Kelli Ward is fighting a subpoena aimed at getting to the bottom of what increasingly appears to be a conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 election so that Donald Trump could serve a second term.",
    "Ward and her husband Michael list all manner of reasons why the House committee looking into the events leading up to the Jan. 6 attack on the nation’s Capitol has no business looking at their phone records.",
    "It’s all there, by the way, laid out beautifully in a two-page memo written by attorney John Eastman, who was working with Trump’s legal team, and presented to Pence in an Oval Office meeting on Jan. 4.",
    "Arizona judge rules that 'law enforcement' is NOT a profession If the Constitution means anything, kick Rep. Gosar off the ballot Does Ducey really think cops in Alaska can help secure our border?",
    "2 on Eastman’s six-point plan: \"When he (Pence) gets to Arizona, he announces that he has multiple slates of electors, and so is going to defer decision on that until finishing the other States.",
    "The plan was uncovered by the Washington Post’s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book “Peril,” but the actual memo outlining the step-by-step scheme was made public in September by CNN.",
    "“And on Jan. 6, Vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose.”\nIt was all laid out in a two-page memo\nAh, Jan. 6, the day Congress was to tally the votes.",
    "This would be the first break with the procedure set out in the (Electoral College) Act.”\nIncreasingly, it appears the Constitution really was one heartbeat away from dying that day.",
    "“So, both those slates of electors went to the Capitol,” then state Rep. Anthony Kern, another of the fake Trump electors, explained in a Dec. 15, 2020, interview with Epoch Times.",
    "They would sign and send to Congress a document avowing that they had been duly elected by Arizona voters to cast the state’s 11 electoral votes for Donald Trump.",
    "Pence, faced with two sets of electoral votes from Arizona and six other states, was then to accept the fake electoral votes and declare Donald Trump the winner.",
    "On that fateful day, Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs would take to the House floor, asking that the certified results of Arizona's election be thrown out.",
    "There, each states’ congressional delegation would cast one vote for president, and given that Republicans at that time controlled 26 states …\nVoila.",
    "Except, of course, for the fact that day by day, it is becomes increasingly clear that absolutely nobody should be laughing.",
    "(Rep. David Schweikert voted to accept Arizona’s election results, though he voted to reject Pennsylvania’s vote.)",
    "When Democrats howled, he would toss the election into the House of Representatives.",
    "It was a masterful plan to thwart the election\nReally, it was a masterful plan.",
    "Fortunately, Pence stood on principle and refused to become a co-conspirator.",
    "America becomes great once again … by putting an end to democracy.",

    "Ward pushed a subpoena for them, but not for her\nNo.",
    "Rep. Debbie Lesko would join them in the vote.",
    "A violation of their First Amendment rights.",

    "Really, it’s hard not to laugh."
