    "After the 2020 election, two groups of Arizona Republicans falsely declared themselves presidential electors, signed fake electoral certificates, and sent them to Washington, D.C., hoping to subvert the constitutional work of the Electoral College, overturn the outcome of a duly certified election and, in essence, stage a coup that would have kept Donald Trump in office.",
    "The other group of fake electors, headed by Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, has also avoided any real trouble, although Ward, Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem and a few others have been subpoenaed by the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.",
    "We learned from an article by The Arizona Republic’s Richard Ruelas that Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office contacted the Office of the Federal Register about paperwork one group of fake electors sent to Washington that used the official state seal.",
    "It's not 'patriot'\nSo far, the only people who have paid a price for the post-election coup attempts and the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection are the taxpayers footing the bills for all of the investigations and court cases.",
    "The sham election audit conducted in Arizona by the Cyber Ninjas, at the behest of Republican state Senate President Karen Fann, has been thoroughly debunked and disproven, another enormous waste of money.",
    "Then again, should we expect Brnovich – currently running for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate – to go after fellow Republicans while simultaneously trying to win the GOP’s primary election?",
    "Arizona judge rules that 'law enforcement' is NOT a profession If the Constitution means anything, kick Rep. Gosar off the ballot Does Ducey really think cops in Alaska can help secure our border?",
    "Unless the oath he swore about upholding the constitution when he became the state’s top law enforcement officer didn’t mean anything.",
    "The Arizonans who aspired to undemocratically keep Donald Trump in office also attempted to stage a coup on the English language.",
    "The post-election legal challenges that made outrageous, unproven claims about voter fraud were tossed by judges again and again.",
    "There is a word for someone who tries overturn the outcome of a duly certified election, but it is not “patriot.”\nIt’s traitor.",
    "But you can’t claim to be a patriot and then act in a way that contradicts the entire notion of what that means.",
    "No sign that fake electors will be prosecuted\nYet, so far, none of the phony electors has paid any price.",
    "We either learn something from the dark days surrounding Jan. 6 or we’ll repeat them.",
    "Even the way we talk about the fake electors’ underhanded power play matters.",
    "And there should be a steep price to pay for those who try to do so.",
    "These disgruntled Republicans call themselves patriots.",
    "Otherwise, we are not the country we say we are.",

    "It should not be easy to stage a coup.",
