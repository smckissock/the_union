    "And when that wasn’t good enough, the Senate auditors produced the most convincing evidence of all that there was no funny business afoot by hackers or nefarious state actors seeking to rob Trump of a second term:\nA hand count of the paper ballots showed that Biden got more votes.",
    "Read about what happened in AZ here: https://amzn.to/3gvllz5.”\nSen. Kelly Townsend’s response was to promptly dismiss the report, repeating a statement she made in September when the Senate and county agreed on hiring Shadegg to conduct a review of the routers.",
    "“I am sorry but too little, too late.”\nTownsend, by the way, slapped yet another election subpoena on Maricopa County this week, based upon a new, questionable analysis from one of the so-called experts whose work on the Senate audit was downright laughable.",
    "For 16 months, Donald Trump and his conspiracy crew have been screaming about Maricopa County’s routers, convinced that these computer networking devices were used in a nefarious plot to hack the county’s tabulation equipment and steal Arizona's election.",
    "“What is going on in Arizona is beyond words.”\nSpeaking of beyond words, Rogers took to Twitter to outright lie about the findings of the router investigation – a tall tale that earned her a “like” from none other than the Trump-endorsed Kari Lake.",
    "A trio of technology experts overseen by former Republican Rep. John Shadegg – the $500-an-hour special master agreed upon by the county and the Senate – found no evidence of an internet connection to the ballot tabulation equipment.",
    "“If Maricopa County cannot bother to answer the questions of @andybiggs4az from a congressional hearing regarding deleted/archived files, why am I supposed to trust or believe any other report they submit?” Townsend tweeted.",
    "Ward, Townsend were quick to dismiss that\nAfter Wednesday’s release of the special master’s report, Rep. Mark Finchem – after more than a year of spouting conspiracy theories about the routers – was curiously radio silent.",
    "Then Rogers jumped in with her own 'truth'\nFinally, let’s hear from the state Sen. Wendy Rogers, who has spent the last year raising money and her own political profile by insisting that Arizona’s vote was stolen.",
    "Their conclusions, of course, were not at all shocking, given that the Republican-run Maricopa County early on assured us the tabulation equipment wasn’t connected to the internet.",
    "“We get the point,” she tweeted, in response to a series of tweets from Maricopa County, announcing the time and the fact that the routers still weren’t connected to the internet.",
    "Why are these commissioners fighting not to give the routers?”\nRouters weren't hooked to the internet\nWell, the audit of those routers is in – the latest one, that is.",
    "And when that wasn’t good enough, a pair of independent experts hired by the county to audit the tabulation equipment assured us it wasn’t connected to the internet.",
    "“The machines were connected to the internet and the elections workers tampered with the machines,” Rogers said, in a post that was retweeted thousands of times.",
    "They also found no evidence that any election data was deleted, purged, overwritten or destroyed, or that there was any attempt to obstruct the Senate’s audit.",
    "In fact, she was in fine form after the release of the router audit, launching into her usual fact-free social media spiel.",
    "State GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward didn’t seem convinced by the router report but used it as an opportunity to hawk her book.",
    "During his Phoenix rally in July, Trump mentioned Maricopa County’s routers no fewer than 11 times in 60 seconds.",
    "Opinion: The latest election audit shows (once again) that Maricopa County's tabulation equipment wasn't hacked.",
    "So was Sen. Sonny Borrelli and many other Stop the Stealers who have been howling to the heavens.",
    "“But if you got those routers, what that will show – and they don’t want to give up the routers.",
    "“The county has, for whatever reason, also refused to produce the network routers,” he said.",
    "And yet the grifting continues from opportunists who have hitched themselves to a lie.",
    "We’re so beyond the routers, there’s so many fraudulent votes without the routers.",
    "#AmericasAudit”\n“‘No proof’ is the cheaters’ rally cry to do it again,” she added.",
    "The Great Arizona Hunt for Election Fraud has, at long last concluded, right?",
    "When, I wonder, are decent Republicans going to wake up and smell the grift?",
    "“The covering up of election crimes is a criminal offense,” she declared.",
    "#AmericasAudit,” Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward tweeted.",
    "Sonny (Borrelli), Wendy (Rogers), we got to get those routers, please!",
    "“I want the routers,” state Sen. Wendy Rogers demanded, ad nauseam.",
    "(By week’s end, expect to see it in yet another plea for funds.)",
    "I will never believe anything whoever runs this account tweets.",
    "Support local journalism: Subscribe to azcentral.com today.",
    "And neither will millions of other truth seekers.",
    "Come on, Kelli (Ward), we can get those routers.",
    "“One of you lies and the next one swears to it.",
    "“The truth is the truth.”\nIndeed, it is.",
    "Oh, a few of them had something to say.",
    "“They think they got away with it.",
    "BTW: there’s overwhelming proof.",
    "They don’t want to give them.",
    "They are fighting like hell.",
    "So now, it’s over, right?",
    "She was far from silent.",
    "“We want the routers.",
    "We want the routers.",
    "Give us the routers.",
    "($19.99 on Amazon).",
    "“Get the routers.",
    "Those routers.",
    "You know what?",
    "So was Trump.",
    "“The routers.",
    "Riiiiight.",
    "Got it.",
    "Yep."
