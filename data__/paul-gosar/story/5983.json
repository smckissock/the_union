    "In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, Greene said, “I have to go to court on Friday and actually be questioned about something I’ve never been charged with and something I was completely against.”\nIn a separate interview with ABC News affiliate WTVC, Greene called the legal challenge a “scam.” According to Greene, “All I did was what I’m legally and allowed to do by the Constitution as a member of Congress, and that was I objected to Joe Biden’s Electoral College votes from a few states.”\nIn addition to Greene, other Republicans are in the crosshairs.",
    "Just recently, a federal judge appointed by Barack Obama allowed a case brought against Greene by several Georgia voters to proceed, saying that the case “involves a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import.”\nAs a result, Greene will now have to testify in front of a state administrative law judge in Atlanta about the events surrounding the Jan. 6 attack.",
    "According to Axios, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Richard Myers blocked a similar case brought against Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C.\nAdditionally, as reported by ABC News:\n“Similar challenges are being brought against GOP Reps.

    "But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.”\nRelying on this provision, specific individuals and groups have sued various Republicans, including GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, based on their alleged involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol.",
    "As of now, nine challenges have been filed against candidates across the country and more are expected to be filed in the coming months.”\nIn an article in The Hill, published early this year, Jonathan Turley correctly warned that Democrats’ loose talk of disqualification was dangerous.",
    "In essence, Democrats are trying to disqualify Republicans for allegedly supporting or encouraging the Jan. 6 “insurrection” because they face the very strong possibility of losing control of one or both chambers of Congress come November.",
    "Knowing this, Democrats are doing their best to prevent various Republicans from running or appearing on the ballot by using an obscure provision in the Constitution.",
    "His articles have been published in The Washington Examiner, The Daily Caller, The Federalist, American Thinker, and other online publications.",
    "He is also a regular guest on OANN’s Tipping Point, and has appeared on Newsmax, The Dave Weinbaum Show, and Real America’s Voice.",
    "The hearing will take place on Friday and will be covered by Right Side Broadcasting Network.",
    "Photo: Alamy\nWith the midterms rapidly approaching, Republicans are poised to do very well.",
