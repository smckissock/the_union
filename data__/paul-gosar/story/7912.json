    "“I denounce anyone who planned to subvert my permitted event and the other permitted events of that day on Capitol grounds to stage any counterproductive activities.”\nDespite his disavowal of other extremist groups that participated in the Jan. 6 attack, CNN previously unearthed video of Alexander saying he intended to reach out to the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers about doing security for his event.",
    "In his statement, Alexander sought to separate himself from the substance of the investigation, saying he did not coordinate with the Proud Boys and suggesting his contact with the Oath Keepers was limited to accepting an offer for them to act as ushers at an event that never took place: his own permitted event near the Capitol, which didn’t occur because of the mob attack on the Capitol.",
    "That event was run by “Women for America First.”\nAlexander’s confirmation of a grand jury subpoena is the first public acknowledgment that the Justice Department’s probe of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has expanded to include organizers of the events that preceded the attack, including some figures adjacent to Trump himself.",
    "| Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\nBy Kyle Cheney\n 04/08/2022 09:15 PM EDT\nAli Alexander, the founder of the Stop the Steal organization that helped promote Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud, said Friday he received a grand jury subpoena from the Justice Department and intends to cooperate with the investigation.",
    "Alexander said in a since-deleted video that he worked with GOP Reps. Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks to attempt to use Congress’ Jan. 6 session certifying Joe Biden’s victory as a chance to pressure lawmakers to overturn the electoral results.",
    "In his lawsuit to block the subpoena, Alexander revealed he had contact on the morning of Jan. 6 with Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancée of Donald Trump Jr. who played a role in securing financing for the ellipse rally.",
    "In a lengthy statement, Alexander denied any wrongdoing and said he is not a target of the investigation, which he said was more clearly aimed at organizers of a Jan. 6 rally near the White House.",
    "Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander returns to a conference room for a deposition meeting on Capitol Hill with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on December 9, 2021.",
    "Lastly, I’m not willing to presume anyone’s guilt.”\n“I did nothing wrong and I am not in possession of evidence that anyone else had plans to commit unlawful acts,” Alexander said.",
    "The Select Committee seemed satisfied with Alexander’s explanation of that short call.”\nGuilfoyle is still in talks with the select committee about potential testimony.",
    "Guilfoyle thanked Mr. Alexander for being a leader on voting rights and creating the ‘Stop the Steal’ movement,” Alexander’s lawyers revealed in the filing.",
    "Alexander has previously testified to the Jan. 6 select committee, where he talked about his contacts with Republican members of Congress.",
    "I wasn’t in communication with any of the aforementioned groups while I was near the Capitol working to get people away from the building.",
    "The issuance of a grand jury subpoena suggests prosecutors believe crimes may have been committed in connection with those events.",
    "“We four schemed up to put maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting,” Alexander said in the video.",
    "Any militia working security at the Ellipse belonged to “Women for America First,” not us,” Alexander said.",
    "I did take Oath Keepers offer to act as ushers for the Area 8 event but all of that was lost in the chaos.",
    "The Oath Keepers are the subject of conspiracy charges for their roles in breaching the Capitol that day.",

    "“The two spoke about the ongoing Georgia election and the GOP primaries that would take place in 2022.",

    "“I did not coordinate any movements with the Proud Boys or even see them that day.",
