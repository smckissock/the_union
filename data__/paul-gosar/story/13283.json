    "Our heroic servicemen and women deserve so much better.”\nRomney went on to call the outbursts “wrong.” He said Republicans and Democrats on the House floor responded with a “quiet boo.”\n“Sometimes people in our own party do things that embarrass me,” he said.",
    "Romney said the challenges facing the country, not just with China and Russia but with inflation, rising crime and illegal immigration, merit people who are willing to solve issues rather than just talk about things that they know will never be passed.",

    "“And I have to think that anybody that would sit down with white nationalists and speak at the conference was certainly missing a few IQ points,” Romney added.",

    "We are not the English House of Commons,” Romney said when asked about the incident during a video press call with Utah reporters Wednesday.",
    "Honor attaches to Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for seeking truth even when doing so comes at great personal cost,” Romney said in a tweet.",
