    "“Preferably, the Department of Justice would lead this effort,” using “the lower civil standard of proof.” If the DOJ does not act, “Congress and private litigants will need to step in” and prevent the American people from voting for the candidates of their choice “[i]f we are to remain a democracy.” Similarly, Noah Bookbinder, the president of the left-wing “ethics” organization CREW, wrote that Americans must prevent “white-collar insurrectionists” who allegedly “inspired the violent insurrectionists” on January 6 from running for office in 2022.",

    "Bush’s bill states that during the 2020 election, “over 140 Members of Congress” took “unprecedented steps to defy the will of the American people who overwhelmingly voted for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris by voting against the certification of the votes of the Electoral College.” Bush falsely asserts that this move is “unprecedented,” as Republicans’ decision not to certify the electoral vote followed the precedent set by Democratic lawmakers in 2000, 2004, and 2016.",
    "Her bill states bizarrely that “refusing to concede the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election … suggests racial animus,” and insists that “efforts by Republican Members of Congress to denounce the votes of millions of Americans is a continuation of Jim-Crow era measures.”\nFinally, Bush’s legislation intimates that all sitting Republicans in the House should be expelled, because they did not vote for Democratic legislation to nationalize elections.",
    "To put that number in perspective, only 20 people have been expelled from Congress in U.S. history — 18 of whom were removed for disloyalty to the government (17 related to the Civil War and one in 1797 for a senator who intended to enrich himself by inducing “Indians and frontiersmen to attack Spanish Florida and Louisiana, in order to transfer those territories to Great Britain”).",

    "Some argue Congress could bar someone from running from office by a simple majority vote — the kind congressional Democrats have already used twice to strip House Republicans of their committee assignments — or that Congress should pass a law enabling judges to determine a candidate’s ability to seek office, giving judges a veto over voters’ preferences.",
    "In May 2019, Rep. Al Green (D-TX) admittedon MSNBC that he believed Democrats must impeach Donald Trump, because “I’m concerned that if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”\nNo party that so brazenly abuses the democratic process can be trusted to protect voters from politicians seeking to overturn elections.",
