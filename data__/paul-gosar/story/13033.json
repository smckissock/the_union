    "CNN host Dana Bash asked the Utah Senator a leading question, asking him to comment on the “pro-Putin sentiment that you are seeing from some corners of your party.”\nRomney said that any Republicans who have spoken positively about the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin are “disgusting” and “almost treasonous”.",
    "“Well, a lot of those people are changing their stripes as they’re seeing the response of the world and the political response here in the U.S.,” said Romney, adding “But how anybody in this country which loves freedom can side with Vladimir Putin — who is an oppressor, a dictator, he kills people.",
    "Anything less than that, in my opinion, is unworthy of American support.”\nThe topic was brought up by Bash in response to a tweet published by another outspoken, anti-Trump RINO, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Republican from Wyoming.",
    "Yesterday, Cheney tweeted “As Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep Paul Gosar speak at this white supremacist , anti-Semitic, pro-Putin event, silence by Republican Party leaders is deafening and enabling.",
    "All Americans should renounce this garbage and reject the Putin wing of the GOP now.”\nCheney was referring to Reps Greene and Gosar speaking at the America First Political Action Committee’s conference.",
    "I’m hopeful you’re seeing some of those people recognize just how wrong they were.”\nCNN’s Bash retorted, “Treasonous is a big word, so I just have to quickly follow up.",
    "The infamous Republican-In-Name-Only Mitt Romney sat down with far-left CNN this morning to bash “white supremacist, anti-Semitic, pro-Putin” Republicans.",
    "But of course, they do it because it’s shock value, and it will get them more eyeballs and make a little more money for them and their network.",
    "The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.",
    "The conference was organized by Nick Fuentes, who has been labeled a “white supremacist” by Joe Biden’s Justice Department.",
    "Would that include the former president?”\nRomney replied, “Well, I said it’s nearly treasonous.",
    "It’s almost treasonous, and it just makes me ill to see some of these people do that.",
    "This piece originally appeared in Objectivist.co and is used by permission.",
    "Standing up for freedom is the right thing to do in America.",
    "He’s been an adversary of America at every chance he’s had.",
    "He imprisons his political opponents.",
    "It’s unthinkable to me.",
    "It’s disgusting."
