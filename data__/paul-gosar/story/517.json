    "The event in Orlando, Florida, on Friday night was organised by the far-right extremist Nick Fuentes, who told attendees: “Now they’re going on about Russia and Vladimir Putin is Hitler – they say that’s not a good thing.”\nHe burst into laughter as he added: “I shouldn’t have said that!”\nFuentes, recently subpoenaed for his involvement in the January 6 insurrection, proudly introduced Taylor Greene at the third annual America First Political Action Conference, or AFPAC.",
    "He’s killing people over and over so I’m staunchly against it and I’m staunchly against Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.”\nAsked if she endorses Fuentes’s views, Taylor Greene claimed: “I don’t know what his views are.”\nTold that he is a white nationalist, she said: “I do not endorse those views.”\nGreene gave the interview on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a separate event in Orlando.",

    "“It is appalling and outrageous that a member of Congress would share a platform with an individual who has actively spread antisemitic bile, mocked the Holocaust and promoted dangerous anti-Israel conspiracy theories,” the group said in a statement.",
    "“Quite simply, the longer Kevin McCarthy gives Marjorie Taylor Greene an unfettered platform and promises to elevate her, the more complicit he is.”\nOn Saturday, Greene sought to defend her appearance at AFPAC.",
    "The Georgia congresswoman told the gathering they were “canceled Americans” who had a responsibility to “stop the Democrats who are the communist party of the United States of America”, HuffPost reported.",
    "Republican leaders are facing fresh demands to expel the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, after she spoke at a conference of white nationalists and sympathisers with Vladimir Putin.",
    "Her patronage of AFPAC, where the Arizona congressman Paul Gosar also appeared via pre-recorded video, provoked sharp condemnation of party leaders for failing to discipline her.",

    "“Now, in regards to Russia, Putin is a murderer and he should never have invaded Ukraine.",
    "She appeared on a panel hours before former president Donald Trump was due to speak.",
    "Lock them all up!”\nWith that she laughed, as the audience burst into applause.",
    "You know they burned crosses in Martin Luther King’s yard just 62 years ago.",
    "But the timing of her AFPAC speech could hardly have been more provocative.",
    "I stand with our Nato member allies and I’m completely against this war.",
    "“This has absolutely no place in the Republican Party.”",
    "We’ve got to investigate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.",
    "“We have to hold Democrats accountable, everybody.",
