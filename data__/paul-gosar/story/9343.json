    "Standing before a bank of cameras, Little also worked in a lighthearted reference to his aggressive deregulation efforts, saying anyone who didn’t know his record was “living on a foreign planet.”\nFor her part, McGeachin, 59, was a mainstream conservative during a decade in the Legislature before transforming herself — like many seeking opportunity and advancement in the Trump era — into an acolyte of the man she calls “the greatest president of our lifetime.”\nHer campaign has consisted largely of attention-seeking stunts, with COVID-19 the wedge she’s used to break from Little.",
    "She has been defending her decision to address a white supremacist gathering in Florida — which put her in the company of extremist GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar — and gone on the attack against authorities over a mistreated 10-month-old being taken from his family and put in protective custody.",

    "In a separate measure, a Quinnipiac Poll last month showed, by a 52%-36% margin, that Republicans sided with Mike Pence over Trump on the question of whether the former vice president could have overturned the 2020 presidential election, as Trump urged.",
    "McGeachin called the action “medical tyranny.”)\nFor years, Idaho has been one of the fastest-growing states in the country, experiencing a boom that’s not only carpeted the landscape with new subdivisions but also changed the tenor of its politics.",
    "On Tuesday, Little appeared in the governor’s ceremonial office — marble columns, gold drapery, big Western oil paintings — to announce “a new online, one-stop shop” to find public meeting information for the state’s executive branch agencies.",
    "A January survey by NBC News found that more than half — 56% — of Republicans interviewed described themselves as more supportive of the GOP than Trump personally, while 36% saw themselves as more supportive of Trump than the Republican Party.",
    "As governor, he’s cut taxes and regulations and kept a light hand during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed businesses to stay open during the worst outbreaks but pitched the health care system into crisis for several months.",
    "That’s a near-total reversal from 2020, when 54% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they considered themselves more supportive of Trump than the party and 38% were more supportive of the GOP than Trump.",
    "Little, 68, an affable third-generation rancher and former head of the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry, is a living embodiment of the business-oriented pragmatic conservatism that has long held sway in his state.",
    "“A president’s endorsement is going to carry more weight than an ex-president’s endorsement,” said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a GOP strategist with extensive experience in congressional and gubernatorial races nationwide.",
    "“Competence matters, and dignity and behavior matter.”\nDuring Trump’s presidency, it was common to hear supporters say they liked his policies even if they didn’t much care for his personality or provocations.",
    "On two occasions when the governor left the state, McGeachin used her temporary authority to issue executive orders prohibiting localities from enforcing mask mandates, and testing and vaccine requirements.",
    "Trump coaxed former Georgia Sen. David Perdue into the Republican primary against Brian Kemp after the governor committed the heresy of refusing to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the state.",
    "But if Idaho — a state Trump won by nearly 2-to-1 over Biden — is any indication, it will take more than a blessing from the former president to boost his preferred candidates into office.",
    "Some of the new arrivals are conservative refugees from blue states like California, who thrill to the pugnacious style of politics that Trump personifies and others emulate.",
    "All of which suggests that Trump’s sway over Republican voters — and, by extension, the Republican Party — is diminishing the further he gets from the White House.",
    "Running for Idaho governor as a disciple of Donald Trump, Janice McGeachin has done almost everything short of surgically attach herself to the former president.",
    "(The child is the grandson of a campaign consultant for Ammon Bundy, the militant right-wing activist who is running for Idaho governor as an independent.",
    "But Perdue is also struggling ahead of the May 24 GOP primary, as are candidates Trump endorsed in Senate primaries in North Carolina and Alabama.",
    "“Especially an ex-president without access to Twitter and (some other) social media (platforms).”\nPolls reflect the waning of Trump’s influence.",
    "Brad Little, a fellow Republican, in the upcoming primary and, as lieutenant governor, acting to overturn his policies when he left the state.",
    "Less than two months before the May 17 primary, McGeachin is fighting for credibility and traction in a race that polls show her losing badly.",
    "“There’s still an old-fashioned sense of propriety,” said Shea Andersen, a Boise communications strategist who’s backing Little’s reelection.",
    "A primary victory by Little would suggest that given the chance to have one without the other, a majority of Republican voters will take it.",
    "Little immediately reversed her actions and secured an opinion from the state attorney general limiting McGeachin’s powers in his absence.",
    "But there remains a significant portion of the Republican Party that prefers a more practical and achievement-oriented approach.",

    "Issues matter and so, most especially, does the quality of each candidate.",
    "She’s also modeled Trump’s flamboyantly defiant behavior, challenging Gov.",
    "Of course, much could change before Republicans vote in May.",
    "(The two were elected separately, not as running mates.)",
    "Lately, McGeachin’s candidacy has further degenerated.",
    "Mark Barabak is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.",
    "Not that the endorsement seems to be doing much good.",
    "She is not alone in facing those difficult straits."
