    "“The story of Ivermectin shows that we as a public have misplaced our trust in the authorities and have underestimated the extent to which money and power corrupts.”\nLawrie said that had Ivermectin being fully deployed in 2020 “when medical colleagues around the world first alerted the authorities to its efficacy, millions of lives could have been saved, and the pandemic with all its associated suffering and loss brought to a rapid and timely end.”\nReferring to the COVID-19 vaccines, Lawrie charged that “hundreds of millions of people have been involved in the largest medical experiment in human history.”\n“Mass vaccination was an unproven novel therapy.",
    "(TeaParty.org Exclusive) – Back in January of 2021, Dr. Andrew Hill of the University of Liverpool published a highly influential pre-print paper and in it stated this conclusion, “Ivermectin should be validated in larger appropriately controlled randomized trials before the results are sufficient for review by regulatory authorities.”\nThe only problem was that in his meta-analysis for the World Health Organization and other leading health agencies in regards to the effectiveness of the repurposed drug in treating COVID, he actually found that Ivermectin reduced hospitalizations by 80%.",
    "Anything less than total transparency cannot be trusted.”\nLawrie said the story of Ivermectin “has highlighted that we are at a remarkable juncture in medical history.”\n“The tools that we use to heal and our connection with our patients are being systematically undermined by relentless disinformation stemming from corporate greed,” she said.",
    "Just sayin'\n— Pierre Kory, MD MPA (@PierreKory) October 8, 2021\nTo all the comments asking for sources/names for the below:\n1) This came from a highly credible source inside Congress who has asked to remain anonymous\n2) I would never divulge the medical treatments of individual members, nor do I know them myself\nI fully stand by this tweet.",
    "“With politicians and other nonmedical individuals dictating to us what we are allowed to prescribe to the ill, we as doctors, have been put in a position such that our ability to uphold the Hippocratic oath is under attack.”\nLawrie proposed that physicians form a new World Health Organization that represents the interests of the people.",
    "https://t.co/be2kBXAjHj\n— Aaron Kheriaty, MD (@akheriaty) November 18, 2021\nIt will change, they know it will change, but they want to turn the tyranny temperature up slowly so the frogs don’t know they’re boiling until it’s too late\n— Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) October 22, 2021\nJaw dropping report just dropped by Project Veritas.",
    "“But, I mean, this is very difficult, because I’m, you know, I’ve got this role where I’m supposed to produce this paper and we’re in a very difficult, delicate balance,” he said.”… Yeah, it’s a very strong lobby.”\nHill promised he would need about six weeks to resolve the stalemate and get Ivermectin approved.",
    "“Never before has our role as doctors been so important,” she concluded, “because never before have we become complicit in causing so much harm.”\nWe need more doctors and medical scientists like Lawrie who are not afraid to stand up for the truth and who are not bought, paid for, and corrupted by Big Pharma.",
    "pic.twitter.com/w7gRzk1PCa\n— L. Louise Lucas (@SenLouiseLucas) January 20, 2022\nI submitted this FOIA request to the FDA: they now claim it will take them 55 years to release the data on which Pfizer's vaccine approval was based, though it only took them 108 days to review this data for the approval process.",
    "She noted that every other country was getting Ivermectin, except for the U.K. and the United States, “because the U.K. and the USA and Europe are owned by the vaccine lobby.”\n“My goal is to get the drug approved and to do everything I can to get it approved so that it reaches the maximum,” Hill vowed.",
    "What is the timeline you’ve allowed for this, then?”\nHill explained that the study needs to go to the WHO, NIH, the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, adding, “And they’ve got to decide when they think enough is enough.”\nHill dropped the truth of the entire pandemic right there in a nutshell.",
    "He says it’s about saving lives: https://t.co/VDd6dAwxE0 @WTKR3 pic.twitter.com/10wf1cbj8I\n— Erin Miller (@Emiller_reports) November 18, 2021\nI testified in the SC Committee on Medical Affairs and gave the evidence base for these medications in the early treatment of the illness.",
    "She replied, “Lots of people are in sensitive positions; they’re in hospital, in ICUs dying, and they need this medicine.”\nAs it turns out, the University of Liverpool received $40 million from UNITAID just four days before Hill was set to publish his study.",
    "Lawrie, the director of the Evidence-Based Medicine Consultancy at the University of the Witwatersrand in Bath, England, was able to get Hill to admit to changing his conclusion on Ivermectin because of pressure from his non-profit sponsors, UNITAID.",
    "We could prevent the elderly from dying.”\nShe said that as a doctor, she is “going to save as many lives as I can.”\n“And I’m going to do that through getting the message [out] on Ivermectin.”\nBut “your work is going to impair that,” Lawrie told Hill.",
    "Fun fact: Between 100-200 United States Congress Members (plus many of their staffers & family members) with COVID.. were treated by a colleague over the past 15 months with ivermectin & the I-MASK+ protocol at https://t.co/OvU8SLfLJq.",
    "UNITAID professes to be a “global health agency” and is funded by vaccine promoters such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which promised $120 million to a Merck drug called molnupiravir, an expensive alternative to Ivermectin.",
    "This is fantastic: pic.twitter.com/PEgJqIXhSD\n— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 14, 2021\nThis is even more impressive when you learn the IVM users were older on average, with 30% >50 yo versus 20% for non-IVM users.",
    "Lawrie is cofounder of the BIRD panel, an international group of actual experts (not the so-called experts the left would have to “follow”) dedicated to the transparent and accurate scientific research of Ivermectin.",

    "https://t.co/Vt6UJ2K7sT\n— Pierre Kory, MD MPA (@PierreKory) October 8, 2021\nJoe Rogan asks Sanjay Gupta if it bothers him that CNN outright lied about Rogan taking horse dewormer to recover from covid.",
    "“Could you please give me a name of someone in UNITAID I could speak to, so that I can share my evidence and hope to try and persuade them to understand it?”\nHill said he would have to think about it.",
    "In conclusion, Lawrie slammed Hill, saying, “You’re not doing everything you can, because everything you can would involve saying to those people who are paying you: ‘I can see this prevents deaths.",
    "So, 80% of those people who are dying today don’t need to die because there’s Ivermectin.”\nHill argued that the National Institutes of Health would not agree to recommend Ivermectin.",
    "On April 24, 2021, she convened the International Ivermectin for COVID Conference, the Desert Review reported, during which she called for reform of the drug approval process.",
    "The FDA could better use its resources to, I don’t know, publicly release the docs submitted by Pfizer to license its mandated liability-free V earlier than 75 years from now!",
