    "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican leaders in Congress are torn over what to do with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene after the congresswoman spoke at a weekend event organized by a white nationalist who marveled over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the crowd erupted in chants of “Putin!”\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy called the congresswoman’s speech on the same stage “unacceptable.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said “there’s no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists.”\nYet it’s unclear whether Greene will face any further reprimand or rebuke for what is now an ongoing pattern of startling behavior.",
    "McConnell offered no public comments, but said in a statement from his office: ‘There’s no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism.”\nGreene defended her appearance at the America First Political Action Committee event, saying she will continue sharing her message to “every corner” of the U.S. She has said she did not personally know the organizer or his beliefs, and participated so she could speak to the large crowd.",
