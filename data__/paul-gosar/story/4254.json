    "Kicking sand in people’s faces is an amusing pastime for Fox News hosts but it’s not in fact “comedy gold.”\nLast year, Weekend Update anchor Michael Che did skewer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: \"Oh please, the only way Nancy Pelosi has a socialist agenda is if Socialist is the name of a restaurant in Napa Valley.” That was probably a joke.",
    "This was McKinnon's 800th “Saturday Night Live” sketch (suitable for framing) but Ingraham didn’t feel honored, judging by her wackadoodle response during Monday’s \"Ingraham Angle.” Describing the impersonation as “cringey,” which was arguably the point, Ingraham proceeded to imitate McKinnon imitating her.",
    "But I think conservatives recognize “Saturday Night Live” as a cultural institution and feel entitled to equal time, even though their hero Ronald Reagan helped abolish the “Fairness Doctrine.”\nAfter her awkward audition, Ingraham offered to appear on “SNL” herself and play Nancy Pelosi.",

    "Select an amount (USD)\n$2$25$5$50$10$100$15$500$20$1000\nStephen Robinson\nStephen Robinson is a writer and social kibbitzer based in Portland, Oregon.",
    "Republicans love to point out that she’s old and maybe had a face lift (Carlson “joked” that she resembled Dr. Zaius-era Michael Jackson).",
    "As John Steed would say, it has \"a certain humorous shape.”\nMichael Che is hardly “woke.” His has no partisan agenda.",
    "It’s unfair somehow if McKinnon performs less flattering impersonations of conservatives than she does of liberals.",
    "Oh, during the Ingraham sketch, cast member Ego Nwodim played Candace Owens, who is unfortunately a real person.",
    "It’s true that “SNL” rarely sends up the so-called Squad, but Fox certainly fills in that demand.",
    "That way the skit will actually be funny and America might even tune in to the show again!",
    "#SaturdayNightLive\nCandace Owens is so delusional she thinks she’s an actual ratings draw.",
    "Here’s the McKinnon sketch from the cold open of the Will Forte-hosted episode.",

    "(Ingraham’s own 2007 attempt at comedy is a painful memory.)",
    "She mocks liberals and so-called RINOs almost exclusively.",
    "He's also on the board of the Portland Playhouse theatre.",
    "I mean, I think this is kind of comedy gold, don’t you?",
