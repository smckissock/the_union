    "“It is irresponsible to effectively confirm the congressional map for this election cycle seven days before voting begins,” he wrote, “especially in the Seventh Congressional District, where almost 90 percent of the electorate is new and nearly two-thirds is an area primarily from another district, foreign to any expectations or connection to the current Seventh District.”\nGibbs district changed from one Trump by 33 points in 2020 to one he would have won by 10 points — but it was unlikely to change party hands this election.",
    "This was a difficult decision, one which I did not make lightly.”\nIn a statement declaring his retirement, Gibbs slammed the Ohio Supreme Court for dragging its feet on deciding legal challenges to the congressional map and leaving the delegation in limbo.",
    "But any votes for Gibbs will not be counted, and the state will notify voters at polling places or via absentee ballot mailing packages that Gibbs is no longer a candidate.",
    "He previously served in the state Senate and the state House, and he was once president of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation.",
    "First elected in 2010, Gibbs handily beat Democratic Rep. Zack Space, helping Republicans reclaim the majority.",
    "“To that end, after considerable deliberation, I have decided to not seek re-election this year.",
    "“This circus has provided me the opportunity to assess my future,” Gibbs said in a statement.",
    "The incumbent’s name will remain on the ballot, according to the Ohio Secretary of State.",
    "He trailed Miller in cash-on-hand at the end of 2021 by about $435,000.",
    "He noted that his 7th Congressional District changed substantially.",
    "There are three other Republican candidates running.",
    "Still, the congressman faced peril in the primary."
