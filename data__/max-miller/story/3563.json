    "He then, though, on his first post-White House weekend, turned one threat into another, having a top political aide talk privately to Republican senators to make sure they knew the defeated and disgraced former president was not going to start a third party but also was not going to step back, was not going to fade away — that he was in fact intent on continuing to be a heavy and consistent presence in the GOP, and that they, in other words, should take that into account when weighing whether to convict or acquit in his upcoming impeachment trial.",
    "On the morning of his last day in office, in the hours before the inauguration of Joe Biden, Trump left the White House and Washington, becoming the first president in 152 years to shun the swearing in of his successor, opting instead at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland for a militaristic send-off that included a 21-gun salute and a poke-in-the-eye playing of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way.” He made it clear in his remarks to a few hundred people from a stage on the wind-whipped tarmac that this was no goodbye for good.",
    "He quit the Screen Actors Guild after the union said he faced a disciplinary hearing for his role in Jan. 6 and “reckless campaign of misinformation.”\n“While I’m not familiar with your work, I’m very proud of my work on movies such as Home Alone 2, Zoolander and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps; and television shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Saturday Night Live, and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, The Apprentice — to name just a few!” Trump responded.",
    "And in these past 365 days, in ways that were totally predictable and in ways that were also absolutely unforeseeable, and in ways that have run the gamut from the gravely serious to the thoroughly absurd, a one-term, twice-impeached president who two weeks before the end of his tenure instigated a deadly insurrection at the citadel of American democracy has obliterated the long-agreed-upon parameters of the post-presidency just as he did with the presidency itself.",
    "He launched what would become a yearlong barrage of criticism of Mitch McConnell, blasting in a more-than-600-word statement the most powerful Republican in the Senate, blaming him for the two lost Senate seats in Georgia (when most everybody blamed Trump himself), taking credit for his reelection (when McConnell certainly would’ve won and perhaps by more than he did without Trump on the ticket) and calling him a bad leader and worse.",
    "“Trump appeared via taped video at a conference at the Unification Church, better known as the ‘Moonies cult,’ and made a visit to a fire and police station in New York, where he began his opening remarks by criticizing Joe Biden for ‘fleeing’ Afghanistan, repeating the lie that the election was ‘rigged,’ and suggesting very strongly that he will run for president in 2024,” as my colleague Ruby Cramer wrote.",
    "Gonzalez in making his announcement had called Trump “a cancer for the country.”\n“RINO Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, who has poorly represented his district in the Great State of Ohio, has decided to quit after enduring a tremendous loss of popularity, of which he had little, since his ill-informed and otherwise very stupid impeachment vote against the sitting President of the United States, me,” Trump said.",
    "And he endorsed a raft of more people for the state legislature and other down-ballot races in Michigan who were in line with him on “voter fraud,” “Election Integrity,” “stop the steal” and “the theft of the 2020 Presidential Election” — Rachelle Smit, Mike Detmer, Mick Bricker, Kevin Rathbun, Jon Rocha, Jacky Eubanks, Angela Rigas and Mike Hoadley.",
    "And in the House, Tom Rice, South Carolina, Adam Kinzinger, Dan Newhouse, Anthony Gonzalez — that’s another beauty — Fred Upton, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Peter Meijer, John Katko, David Valadao — and, of course, the warmonger, a person that loves seeing our troops fighting: Liz Cheney,” he said in what sounded like the reading of a hit list.",
    "In a response to the response of corporate behemoths to Georgia’s new voting restrictions — including Major League Baseball’s decision to pull its All-Star Game from Atlanta — Trump decried “CANCEL CULTURE.” “Boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS, and Merck,” he said.",
    "It was the first of an ongoing litany of Trump’s endorsements as a former president — fueled by his monomaniacal insistence that he won an election that he lost, fixated on the five most important states that he lost that made him lose, furious at anybody who didn’t subvert democracy by overturning those results.",
    "On the last day of February at CPAC in Orlando, in his first speech as an ex- in which he teased a comeback of a presidential run in 2024, Trump issued what amounted to a call-to-arms for 2021 and 2022 against the seven Senate Republicans and the 10 House Republicans who voted for his impeachment.",
    "He reopened his online merchandise store — which had been dormant since Shopify shut it down over Trump’s role in triggering the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — a quiet but important mile marker in his mounting efforts to solidify his influence on the elections of 2022 and potentially 2024.",
    "He lashed out at two of the more known faces of public health guidance — Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci — accusing them of being “self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations, which I fortunately almost always overturned.”\n22.",
    "To reengage with the reams of news coverage of Trump from the course of the last 12 months, to read and reread his statements in chronological order, is to get a visceral, dizzying reminder of the persistence, of the manic relentlessness with which he has done this and is doing it.",
    "He hasn’t written a standard memoir, but he has spent nearly every day rewriting the history of his administration, perpetuating the destabilizing fiction that he won when he lost and pile-driving a path through this year’s midterms to the possibility of a comeback run in 2024.",
    "He reasserted a constrictor’s grip on the GOP — literally attempting to engineer the face of the party by publicly picking candidates in scores of races, from swing-state senators to state ag commissioners, a New York borough president, a smaller-city mayor and a county judge.",
    "He summoned into a backroom at Mar-a-Lago four of the candidates in that Ohio Senate primary for a 15-minute “backbiting” meeting that some likened to “The Apprentice” and one person familiar compared to “The Hunger Games,” the contenders desperately vying for his endorsement.",
    "He sent cease-and-desist letters to the three largest fundraising operations for the Republican Party — the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee — for using his name and his likeness in money-making appeals.",
    "“Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack,” Trump said in a statement released in an email from his Save America PAC, a conduit he was turning into sort of his new Twitter feed, “and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again.",
    "Biden, the man who beat him, has ushered through Congress trillions of dollars of legislation, and might manage to persuade lawmakers to spend trillions more, no small record of accomplishment in spite of setbacks and stalemates in a historically challenging time.",
    "“There was this pregnant pause around the impeachment and the January 6 riot that was ‘Trump was toxic and Trump doesn’t want us to use his name.’ But we’ve now reverted back to the past five years, where Trump is the biggest name in Republican politics.",
    "He gave his first speech since CPAC in late February in Orlando, at the North Carolina GOP convention in Greenville, speaking for 85 minutes in a preview of a summer return to the kinds of rallies he’s used for years to stoke his political rise and rule.",
    "“He’s way behind schedule,” he said, “and people are refusing to take the Vaccine because they don’t trust his Administration, they don’t trust the Election results, and they certainly don’t trust the Fake news, which is refusing to tell the Truth.”\n91.",
    "“In the last hundred years,” said Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian whose books include one specifically on former presidents called Second Acts, “there is nobody more politically consequential as a former president than Donald Trump.”\nJANUARY\n1.",
    "“Even Andrew Jackson in 1825, when he lost under shady circumstances in the House, did not pretend he was actually president,” Jen Mercieca, a professor of political rhetoric and the author of a book about “the rhetorical genius” of Trump, told me.",
    "Weeks after the House GOP leader stated that Trump bore some responsibility for the events of Jan. 6 and even entertained the notion of a censure, Trump permitted the man he once called “my Kevin” to come to Mar-a-Lago to essentially say sorry.",
    "Through his super PAC — “Make America Great Again, Again!” — he polled for his looming 2024 comeback run, the results of which showed him leading Biden in all five states he lost in 2020 — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",
    "He co-opted the language used to describe his fiction of a “stolen election” — the same way he did in early 2017 with “fake news.” “The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE,” he said.",
    "Hardening the divide in the country between those who are for him and those who are not, he demanded fealty and vowed revenge, raised and hoarded money, targeted people who want to hold him to account and touted those who don’t or won’t.",
    "“New United States COVID cases, because of the record-breaking development of the vaccine and its early purchase and distribution by the Trump Administration has hit its lowest level in more than one year, and falling fast,” he said.",
    "“Send your donation to Save America PAC at DonaldJTrump.com.” “I fully support the Republican Party and important GOP Committees, but I do not support RINOs and fools,” he said in a walk-back that wasn’t really a walk-back.",
    "He did not speak at Shanksville, Pennsylvania, like a fourth former president, George W. Bush, who cited the “unity of America” in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of 20 years back and lamented the lack of that now.",
    "“What happened on Jan. 6 was a protest against a rigged election — that’s what it was,” he said in one of four (sometimes patchily attended) “History Tour” conversations with Bill O’Reilly in arenas in Florida and Texas.",
    "“One of the biggest stories in the Lamestream Media yesterday was the very important Congressional race in Ohio and whether or not Trump-backed candidate, Mike Carey, would lose,” he said in another statement.",
    "“And I would recommend it to a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me, frankly,” he told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo — stopping short, though, of supporting any mandates.",
    "Responding to news that the New York attorney general was assisting the Manhattan district attorney in a criminal investigation into the affairs of the Trump Organization, he recycled by now familiar rhetoric.",
