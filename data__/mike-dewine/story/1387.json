    "Mike DeWine, a Republican who sits on the redistricting commission, said of the Democratic proposal: “Upon initial review, the Democrats’ new map looks nearly identical to their map presented three weeks ago, which raised many questions in the commission hearing about whether it violated the anti-gerrymandering provisions of the Ohio Constitution.”\nRepublicans also have shared concerns with how the Democratic proposal would handle House incumbents, with the proposal pairing zero Democratic incumbents in the same district while pairing an uncertain number of House Republicans.",
    "By Andrew J. Tobias - cleveland.com\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — The two Democrats on the Ohio Redistricting Commission said Friday, less than a week before the latest court-imposed deadline and amid talks rescheduling the May primary election, they still had not seen a new state legislative map proposal from their Republican counterparts, and also didn’t know when the redistricting commission might even meet.",
    "“Republicans who say otherwise simply refuse to work with Democrats to craft fair maps.”\nAlthough they are unlikely to be approved by Republicans, Democrats said they are publicly sharing their maps in an effort to be transparent and demonstrate to the court that it’s possible to draw politically proportionate maps that follow the state constitution.",
    "But elections officials, who are unable to complete crucial preparatory work while the districts remain in flux, say the process already has dragged on long enough to pose complications, leading Huffman earlier this week to float the idea of scheduling a separate primary for races for which the maps remain in flux.",
    "Meanwhile, a spokesman for a top Republican on the redistricting commission mocked the map proposal Democrats presented to the public on Friday while also taking a shot at the wisdom of the Ohio Supreme Court majority that has rejected two sets of Republican-drawn maps as illegal gerrymanders for good measure.",
    "At the news conference, the Democrats went over their latest state legislative map plan, which would favor Republicans to win 54 House seats and 18 Senate seats, or 54% of Ohio’s state legislative seats, with Democrats favored to win the remaining 46%, designed around the statewide vote share number.",
    "“Of the different options that present themselves for conducting a primary election this year, holding two separate primaries is the worst one available to the legislature,” Aaron Ockerman, executive director of the Ohio Elections Officials Association, wrote to Huffman and other legislative leaders.",
    "A 4-3 majority, with Republican Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor joining the court’s three Democrats, said they violated Ohio’s redistricting rules by not favoring each party to win seats more closely proportional to the 54% Republican, 46% Democratic share of the recent statewide vote each party got.",
    "“I’m sure at this point, Democrats believe they could draw house and senate maps in crayon and watercolor, and the same four members of the court would approve their unconstitutional maps,” John Fortney, a spokesman for Senate President Matt Huffman, said in a statement.",
    "“But the thing for me that’s more appalling is that 360,000 people would be thrown aside and forced to wait six years between senatorial elections.”\nAaron Mulvey, a spokesman for House Speaker Bob Cupp, a Republican, also criticized the latest Democratic map.",
    "Special interests from Washington, D.C. are.”\nIn other words, it appears Ohio’s interminable redistricting process, the first time it’s being done under a new set of anti-gerrymandering rules approved by voters in 2015, is headed down a familiar road.",
    "However, upon cursory review, it seems pretty clear that the map does not meet the requirements of the Constitution or the standard set forth by the Ohio Supreme Court,” Mulvey said, while not specifying what the specific constitutional issues were.",
    "On Monday, the court rejected those too, saying the maps’ number of Democratic districts was inflated with slightly Democratic toss-up districts, with few corresponding Republican-leaning districts that conceivably could be won by either party.",
    "“They have purposely delayed work on these maps at each stage along the way, waiting until virtually the last minute of each deadline before finally acting in a clear attempt to run out the clock,” Russo said in a Friday news conference.",
    "A set of maps Republicans approved the following month, following a process marked by secrecy and frustration even by some Republicans on the commission, favored the GOP to win nearly two-thirds of state legislative seats.",
    "County elections officials sharply criticized the move, saying it would cost taxpayers millions of dollars and strain elections officials while likely leading to a sharp drop-off in voter turnout for the second election.",
    "Despite the time crunch, House Minority Leader Allison Russo and Sen. Vernon Sykes, the two Democrats on the redistricting commission, said Friday they still hadn’t seen any map ideas from Republicans.",
    "Democrats said they went over their map the day before with staff for Secretary of State Frank LaRose and state Auditor Keith Faber, two Republicans on the seven-member Ohio Redistricting Commission.",
    "“The majority party can’t blame anybody but themselves when they created this redistricting mess by disregarding the will of Ohioans by twice voting for unconstitutional state maps,” she said.",
    "That’s why he said he floated scheduling a second primary for those races, leaving in place plans to hold elections for local and statewide races, like the governor and U.S. Senate in May.",
    "In an interview, McColley said the Democratic plan would split his current Senate district into two others whose representatives wouldn’t be up for re-election until 2024.",
    "With the maps in flux, Huffman earlier this week said he increasingly doubts that Ohio will be able to hold elections in May for state legislative and congressional races.",
    "Chris Glassburn, Democrats’ Cleveland-based mapping consultant, said the new one fixes geographic and other technical errors Republicans highlighted by Republicans.",
    "And on Friday, Fortney, the Senate GOP spokesman, blasted the new plan, including criticizing how Democrats handled a Senate district in Northwest Ohio held by Sen.",
    "Ohio’s new redistricting rules are meant to encourage bipartisanship by requiring minority-party votes for new state legislative maps to last the typical 10 years.",
    "The Ohio Redistricting Commission, a panel of five Republican elected officials and two Democratic ones, first met to approve state legislative maps last August.",
    "But he also said voters who live in the district now would go six years — from 2018, when McColley was elected, until 2024 — without voting for a state senator.",
    "The plan is a tweaked version of that which Democrats introduced last month before Republicans went forward with their plan that the court later rejected.",
    "They also said they didn’t know when the commission might meet publicly since Republicans and Democrats must both agree for a meeting to be held.",
    "Republican commission members have panned Democrats’ past maps, describing them as contorted to maximize the number of Democratic seats.",
    "Democrats said Friday they lack a list of addresses for Republican caucus members needed to check how their maps might affect them.",
    "The court’s latest order gave the commission until next Thursday to approve new maps, which must be in place for the May primary.",
    "“I have not drawn with House district members in mind, and I am not instructed by the constitution to do that,” Glassburn said.",
    "So Republicans passed a new set of maps late last month, with those favoring the GOP to win 58% of state legislative seats.",
    "But the Ohio Supreme Court last month rejected those maps, calling them unconstitutionally slanted in favor of Republicans.",
    "Russo said Friday that Democrats’ preference is that Republicans propose maps that Democrats will support next week.",
    "And the commission also must draw new congressional maps by mid-March, after the court rejected a previous set.",
    "The effect would be that McColley couldn’t run for re-election when his term expires at the end of the year.",
    "But they said they still haven’t seen any map proposals or even regional concepts from Republicans.",
    "“While we have not yet completed a thorough analysis of the map presented by the Democrats today.",
    "Republicans have said a meeting is likely to be held early next week, but no date has been set.",
    "Republicans still can pass maps on their own, but they expire after four years instead.",
    "Republicans have said they plan to take up congressional maps later this month.",
    "But if they don’t, she said they might agree to move the entire election.",
    "“Our map is just one of many options that can achieve this,” Russo said.",
    "Meanwhile, Russo said Republicans are to blame for where things stand.",
    "“Clearly, the legislative Democrats aren’t calling the shots.",
    "I would like the opportunity to run in 2022,” McColley said.",
    "Rob McColley, a member of GOP leadership.",
    "Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Gov.",
