    "Andrew J. Tobias - cleveland.com (TNS)\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — On Friday, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose praised Ohio House Republicans’ still preliminary threats to impeach Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor over her role in rejecting several sets of Republican-drawn political maps in the ongoing redistricting process, making him the highest-profile state Republican to do so.",
    "The Ohio Supreme Court initially faulted Republicans for passing maps in September that disproportionately favored their party, saying the maps violated constitutional language that directs the maps to contain districts that Republicans and Democrats are likely to win in close proportion to the parties’ share of the statewide vote.",

    "In an interview, Clark, a councilwoman from Forest Park in suburban Cincinnati, said LaRose’s comments contradict his public posturing as an elections official who tries to seek bipartisan compromise.",
    "I certainly wouldn’t oppose it.”\nBut LaRose went on to take issue with the political tactics of impeaching O’Connor, since it wouldn’t be completed in time to make a difference in redistricting.",
    "LaRose and other Republicans approved a fourth set of maps on Monday, tweaking the most recent set the court rejected and abandoning a map drawn by a bipartisan set of outside mapmakers.",
    "Maps likely will have to be drawn and approved by the court by April 20 for them to be used sometime this year, and if they’re not, a federal court is likely to take over the process.",
    "In a concurring opinion, O’Connor took the extraordinary step of urging voters to consider abolishing the redistricting commission and replacing it with an independent panel.",
    "All were judges in the early 1800s, and all were acquitted, meaning the Senate didn’t vote to finalize their removal, except for one judge who was absent without leave.",
