    "The Montana Board of Investments - which oversees nearly $25 billion in assets held by the state’s pension funds, workers’ compensation funds and money held by schools, universities and local governments - has identified about $15 million in assets that are “tied to Russian interests,” and is reviewing ways to exit from them, Dan Villa, the board’s executive director, said Tuesday.",

    "“The pension systems invest billions of dollars of assets that belong to public employee retirees,” Yost said.",
    "The request is nonbinding, but he said the funds have a fiduciary responsibility to their members.",
