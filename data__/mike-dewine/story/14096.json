    "The plan also adopted the federal guidance levels for PFAS and instructed the Ohio EPA to set up protocols for when those levels are exceeded, including “public notification and issuance of drinking water advisories.”\nOther water quality legislation in Ohio\nHouse Bill 349 would prohibit new concentrated animal feeding operations from being built in the Maumee River watershed unless certain water quality goals are met.",
    "“These are Ohio-specific standards based on the evidence for drinking water based on a review of the best scientific evidence, nor is there a cost to companies or manufacturers.”\nStill, some committee members were concerned about the potential added cost for water treatment facilities to test for and treat water if PFAS is found, particularly in communities that are already struggling with older public water systems.",
    "Russo also emphasized in her sponsor testimony that the legislation would provide “clear guidance to Ohio’s companies on how to maintain a healthy environment while continuing to participate in a thriving economy.”\nThe lack of a federal standard for PFAS “creates regulatory whiplash” and uncertainty for businesses that operate in multiple states, Frech told Farm and Dairy.",

    "“It seems to me that safe drinking water is a right and that we have every obligation to do everything we can to not only identify where there are problems, but then to mitigate them when they occur.”\n(Reporter Rachel Wagoner can be contacted at 800-837-3419 or rachel@farmanddairy.com.)",
    "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2016 recommended a non-enforceable health advisory of 70 parts per trillion for PFAS in drinking water and promised to set stricter national standards for two types of PFAS — PFOA and PFOS — by 2023.",
