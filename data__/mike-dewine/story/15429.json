    "Governor DeWine Announces New H2Ohio Program to Help Remove and Replace Lead Pipes\n(COLUMBUS, Ohio)— As part of his comprehensive strategy to address lead hazards and prevent lead poisoning in Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine announced Monday that his H2Ohio initiative is investing $4 million to locate, remove, and replace toxic lead pipes in various communities throughout the state.",
    "This funding includes $1.4 million for mini-grants of up to $50,000 for individual public water systems and $600,000 for the Rural Community Assistance Program (RCAP) and the Ohio Rural Water Association (ORWA) to provide direct identification and mapping assistance to small public water systems.",
    "“My focus every day is on the health and safety of all of our citizens, and I won’t be satisfied until lead pipes are truly a thing of the past.”\nToday, most water service lines are copper or galvanized iron, but an estimated 6.1 million lead water lines remain across the nation.",
    "“Addressing lead service lines is not only a key goal under the H2Ohio initiative, but it’s also part of the Governor’s overall commitment to the health and well-being in communities,” said Ohio EPA Director Laurie A. Stevenson, whose office is administering the grant program.",
    "The remaining $2 million in grant funds will be awarded to help identify, inventory, and map lead service lines in public water systems that do not have the financial means to properly assess where their lead service lines are located.",
    "“We want all of our residents, no matter where they live, to be confident that their drinking water is clean and not contaminated by decomposing lead pipes that should have long ago been replaced,” said Governor DeWine.",
    "Of the $4 million to be awarded through the H2Ohio Lead Service Line Replacement Grant Program, approximately $2 million will go to six communities whose lead pipes are mapped and ready for replacement.",
    "“By giving communities this help to create true and accurate maps of lead lines in their communities, they’ll be better prepared to launch replacement projects of their own.”",
    "Lead primarily enters drinking water when materials containing lead in water distribution systems and household plumbing corrode.",
    "The removal and replacement projects in these communities will eliminate a total of nearly 500 lead service lines.",
    "In our region, The City of Delphos, in Allen and Van Wert Counties, will receive $500,000."
