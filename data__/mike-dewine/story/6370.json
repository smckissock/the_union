    "Mike DeWine, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Auditor Keith Faber – all Republican members of the redistricting commission who voted for the map – told the judges that the Ohio Supreme Court is still looking at that second congressional map, though a decision won’t come out till May, after the primary is over.",

    "A panel of three federal judges is considering a request not to certify the results of the May 3 congressional primary.",
