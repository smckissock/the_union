    "The current constitutional language for state legislative lines refers to political proportionality, meaning the districts should favor each party to win seats in close proportion to their share of the statewide vote, while both state legislative and congressional lines have language that says the maps shouldn’t be drawn to benefit either party.",
    "DeWine said as the Ohio Redistricting Commission has tried to meet political proportionality — which the Ohio Supreme Court ruled means trying to create districts that lean 54% Republican and 46% Democratic, in line with each party’s share of the recent statewide vote — they’ve done so at the expense of making the districts competitive.",
    "None of the various maps DeWine and other Republicans have approved — including the first state legislative map in September, a time when Republicans were arguing the political standards were optional — have scored high marks for competitiveness, according to modeling from Dave’s Redistricting App, a widely used redistricting website.",
    "DeWine told reporters Thursday the ongoing redistricting process — which has bogged down into dysfunction as state Republicans have failed to get Ohio Supreme Court approval so far for any of the various maps they’ve passed — hasn’t played out how he envisioned when he voted for the redistricting reforms in 2015 and 2018.",
    "The nonpartisan group, which has sued the state over its state legislative and congressional maps, is looking at pursuing a reform to replace the Ohio Redistricting Commission, a panel of elected officials that includes DeWine that’s tasked with drawing the lines, with a nonpartisan commission instead, Miller said.",
    "Meanwhile, Republicans’ most recent state legislative map proposal, a slight tweak from a previous version the Ohio Supreme Court rejected, has 17 toss-up House and Senate districts, all of which lean slightly Democratic, with no corresponding Republican-leaning toss-up districts.",
    "The Ohio Supreme Court, with Republican Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor joining the three Democratic justices, cited the imbalance in how competitive districts were drawn for each party as one of the central reasons they struck down the last state legislative map.",
    "It seems to me that in the state constitution, if we do this again, we need to have one of the stated goals to be competitive districts.”\nAny change to the rules would require a constitutional amendment, which ultimately would require voter approval.",
    "Asked about the redistricting process during a media availability on Thursday, Liz Walters, chair of the Ohio Democratic Party, said Republicans deserve the blame for how redistricting has gone, not the way the system itself was designed.",
    "He suggested that competitiveness should be among the criteria that lay out how the lines must be drawn, once other rules are met, like those limiting how communities can be split.",
    "Mike DeWine thinks Ohio should add district competitiveness to the language in the state constitution laying out the political standards legislative district lines must meet.",
    "Jen Miller, executive director of the League of Women Voters, said DeWine and other politicians who run the redistricting process are the problem, not the process itself.",
    "“I think the problem with the current process is that elected officials are given too much power to rig maps in their favor,” Miller said.",
    "“It’s hard to say the process has failed when you have one party that’s refusing to participate at all,” she said.",
    "“I don’t think it mattes what the criteria is if elected officials aren’t willing to put voters first.”\nPrevious",
    "“Let’s see how this plays out, let’s get the election behind us,” DeWine said.",
    "Andrew J. Tobias - cleveland.com (TNS)\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — Gov.",
    "“But I think we need to take a hard look at this."
