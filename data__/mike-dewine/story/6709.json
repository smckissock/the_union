    "Employers won’t have to pay for small periods of time beyond the employee’s scheduled working hours, unless the employer requests those activities.",
    "\"Employees will have a clear indication of what directives employers have regarding overtime work, and they must be explicit,\" said Brenner.",
    "This is earned money,\" Smith said, noting that a study showed 67% of all Ohio jobs pay less than $40,000 a year.",
    "\"And employers will know what they will have to do regarding overtime payments for work that is not requested.\"",
    "But Democrats including Rep. Kent Smith said it opens the door to wage theft.",
    "Mike DeWine, after the Senate agreed to changes made by the House last week.",
    "To see more, visit The Statehouse News Bureau.",
    "“Overtime pay protections are not a handout.",
