    "In the resolution that urges the Ohio General Assembly to repeal the law, council noted that the bill \"was passed and signed over objections from law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio, county sheriffs, Ohio Mayors Alliance, and Democrats, emphasizing the danger that taking away licensing and training requirements poses to law enforcement officers and communities.\"",
    "The resolution also adds that “while Cleveland works to reduce the number of guns that lead to violent crime, the State of Ohio’s deregulation of handguns will increase gun ownership and proliferation of unregulated guns in our community.”\nThe new law goes into effect in June.",
    "Mike DeWine signed the bill that will make a concealed weapons permit optional for anyone legally allowed to carry a gun and eliminate the requirement that individuals “promptly” notify police officers that they are carrying a concealed weapon.",
    "CLEVELAND — Cleveland City Council passed a resolution on Monday strongly opposing the new state law that allows Ohioans 21 years and older to carry concealed handguns without a license and safety training.",
