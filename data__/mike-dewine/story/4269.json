    "And they were offering money and plane tickets to people on the ground who were getting petitions signed.”\nTo take it a step further, Householder’s team paid over $23 million for an advertising campaign warning that “the Chinese government is quietly invading our American electrical grid” and “coming for our energy jobs.” They followed up with a mailer telling residents that if they signed the petition, they’d be giving their “personal information to the Chinese government.” Of course, China had nothing to do with the effort to stop House Bill 6: The editorial board of the Cleveland Plain Dealer noted that the claims were spurious and called it “the sleaziest scare ad in recent memory.”\nFederal investigators claim that Householder and his team went so far as to try to infiltrate the citizen campaign seeking to overturn House Bill 6 by bribing one of its employees, Tyler Fehrman.",
    "In a recording made by an FBI informant wearing a wire at a dinner party with Householder, Clark describes the plan: “We have to go out on the corners and buy out their people every day … If we knock off 25 people collecting signatures, it virtually wipes them out in the next 20 days; this ends the whole fucking thing.”\n“Really the dirtiest thing was the effort to kill the petition drive,” said David DeVillers, the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio who oversaw the case for the FBI.",
    "Nobody knows the money goes into the speaker’s account — it is controlled by his people, one of his people, and it’s not recorded.”\nIn the lead-up to the 2018 elections, FirstEnergy wired about $2 million to Householder’s dark money accounts, which then went to pay anywhere from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars for approximately 21 campaigns around the state.",
    "Even if Householder had been on the level and planning on publicly reporting the money as a gift, he asked: “How do you justify to the people in this room, to people on this committee, and to your constituents back home, accepting a gift of that magnitude for your personal expenses?”\nBefore Householder could speak, his attorney, Mark Marein, slipped up behind him.",
    "Howard Learner, president of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, suggested that the utility was telling at least a partial truth about the plants: When it filed for bankruptcy in 2018, the plants were unprofitable, but it was the bankruptcy process of restructuring debt and renegotiating union contracts that led to their profitability, not a bailout.",
    "One ad, featuring a power station worker, aired so frequently that even Householder complained in a text message that he was getting tired of seeing “that poor sumbitch drive that pickup truck down the road and cry about losing his job.” Less than two months after Householder introduced the bill, HB6 cleared in the Ohio House in late May.",
    "In a statement, a representative of FirstEnergy wrote that it has paused all political contributions and is taking “decisive actions to address recent challenges, rebuild trust with its stakeholders, and position the Company for long-term success.”\nHouse Bill 6 remains in effect, but it has shed the facade of being a nuclear bailout.",
    "When House Bill 6 passed, FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones, sent Randazzo a picture of Mount Rushmore with their heads, along with the faces of Wayne Boich — a coal scion who contributed money Householder’s dark money groups — and another utility executive, photoshopped over Washington, Lincoln, and the other dead presidents.",
    "“Utilities are rolling back climate policy, and they are charging ratepayers to do it.”\nIn 2008, Ohio passed its first renewable energy law, mandating the construction of wind turbines and solar panels while creating programs to help residents and businesses insulate their homes and upgrade their appliances.",
    "“It’s really just all about the money and driving as much profit as they can for their shareholders.”\nAs it becomes clear that clean energy poses an existential threat to fossil fuels, utilities that bet on the insignificance of renewables are launching counterattacks to maintain their dwindling turf.",
    "Their investigation suggested the politician had orchestrated a grand conspiracy in which three electric utilities — FirstEnergy, its former subsidiary Energy Harbor, and American Electric Power — gave Householder a $60 million slush fund to help get like-minded politicians into the Ohio legislature.",
    "But nothing came of those charges, and in October 2016 he and his aide, Jeff Longstreth, mapped out an ambitious strategy: Not only would Householder run for office again, but he would also recruit candidates all over the state and provide the money to help them win their campaigns.",
    "“For regulated utilities, profits are determined by how much political influence you wield,” said Dave Anderson, communications and policy manager of the nonprofit watchdog organization Energy and Policy Institute, which has been digging up the details of this case for years.",
    "What I will never ever concede is that I was asking him for information that he was not allowed to give me.” Borges also said the check he handed Fehrman was to organize a party for former Ohio Supreme Court Justice Judi French — not for information on the repeal movement.",
    "The utility’s power plant-owning subsidiary — FirstEnergy Solutions (later renamed Energy Harbor) — was deep in debt, and its old coal and nuclear plants were no longer providing reliable profits as renewables and cheap natural gas brought down the price of electricity.",
    "The caption in capital letters: “HB 6 FUCK ANYBODY WHO AINT US.”\nIn a legal agreement with federal prosecutors, FirstEnergy admitted it had paid a bribe of over $4 million to Randazzo shortly before his appointment as head of the Public Utility Commission.",
    "The growth in renewable energy is utterly transforming the power industry, he explained, and it only makes sense that some companies might fail to adapt, in the same way that the once mighty Blockbuster failed to adapt to the innovation of streaming video.",
    "But it also presents an unusually vivid picture of the larger trend of fossil fuel companies using every trick they can to keep milking money from their investments in dirty energy — tiptoeing right up to legal boundaries and sometimes stepping over them.",
    "It also paved the way for the passage of a law in 2019, House Bill 6, “widely recognized as the worst energy policy in the country,” according to Leah Stokes, an environmental political scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
    "House Bill 6 nearly halved the renewable power that utilities were required to buy, eliminated energy efficiency laws, handed a billion dollars to the state’s two nuclear power plants, and spent even more money to keep coal plants burning.",
    "Other states were starting to pay nuclear plants extra for producing carbon-free electricity, and if Ohio failed to do the same, or provide some other sort of “legislative solution,” the company warned, the plants would close.",
    "“We are trying to go from the hammer of the mandates, do away with the mandates, and instead provide a carrot,” Householder told reporters in a government conference room as he gestured at a whiteboard full of talking points.",
    "To opponents, it was a “nuclear bailout.” To backers, it was a sort of state-level “Clean Air Act,” meant to keep Ohio’s two nuclear plants from closing, thereby preserving the state’s largest source of zero-emissions energy.",
    "After a federal investigation in Illinois, the utility Commonwealth Edison admitted in 2020 that it had bribed the state’s Speaker of the House, arranging jobs, subcontracts, and monetary payments for the politician.",
    "Along with interviews and accounts published by Ohio newspapers, we’ve used this information ahead of the start of Householder’s trial to build out a narrative of the brazen attempt by utilities to buy legislation.",
    "He was known as a talker, when knocking on doors in a camouflage hat and bulky sweatshirt while campaigning, or presiding in a tailored blue suit from the speaker’s thronelike marble dais in the Ohio House Chamber.",
    "A recent report from Gabel Associates, an energy consulting firm, suggests the law will cost Ohioans $2 billion in excess utility bills and $7 billion in health care costs stemming from pollution over nine years.",

    "A majority of House Democrats backed him after he offered them a big increase in public transit funding, a say in the budget process, and a promise that he would protect union rights and health care for the poor.",
    "“I have never experienced such pressure for any other bill,” one member of the Ohio House of Representatives wrote to another in a text that the FBI turned over to journalists after a public records request.",
    "In an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Fehrman said he asked his friend Matt Borges, a former state chairman of the Republican Party who had begun helping Householder with House Bill 6, for advice.",
    "Now, there’s more temptation than ever: State legislatures are increasing regulation of dirty fuels in the interest of taking on climate change, while falling prices for wind and solar undercut their market.",
    "A decade earlier, Householder had stepped down from his position as Ohio Speaker of the House and left politics after the media reported that the FBI was investigating corruption allegations against him.",
    "The bill that Housholder shepherded into law three years ago forces Ohioans to fork over $200,000 a day to buoy ailing coal plants — Stokes estimates the total coal subsidies could come to $1.7 billion.",
    "But every bailout they’d tried to engineer had died in the legislature, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had shot down an agreement that would have subsidized its nuclear and coal plants.",
    "Generation Now and the other dark money groups spent over $16 million on mailers and television ads urging Ohioans to call their senators and representatives and ask them to vote for House Bill 6.",
    "“None of the arguments for House Bill 6 hold water except that this is policy driven entirely by a single larger donor,” Kent Smith, a Democratic state representative from east Cleveland, said.",
    "Earlier that year, Ohio Governor DeWine had picked Randazzo, a lawyer who had earned millions as a consultant to FirstEnergy since 2010, to be the head of the state’s Public Utility Commission.",
    "Near the end of the hearing, however, Rick Carfagna, a Republican representative from central Ohio, asked a question that snapped the enormity of charges against Householder into focus.",
    "“The sad reality is that utility incumbents hold off competition and technological innovation through corruption of the legislative process when their merit case is weak,” Learner said.",
    "But he defended himself at length last June, when Ohio state legislators finally decided the evidence of wrongdoing was overwhelming and expelled him from the House of Representatives.",
    "And many other states have passed coal bailouts under pressure from utilities and dark money groups, though in most cases there’s not solid evidence that lobbying crossed legal lines.",
    "“If we want clean renewable energy, we need clean government.”\nThe reality, however, is that these scandals are likely to continue, Learner said, until people start going to jail.",
    "Clark, the self-styled “Prince of Darkness” lobbyist, warned lawmakers that Householder had gone “to war” for the utilities with House Bill 6, twisting arms and calling in favors.",
    "As Householder left the courthouse, his head bowed, the yellow straps of an N95 mask cutting into the back of his neck, a gaggle of reporters thrust microphones toward his face.",
    "“And if Blockbuster had decided it’s going to mount a battle in the Ohio legislature to stop streaming services from coming to market, it would have had to spend its own money.",
    "A few months later, FirstEnergy began wiring hundreds of thousands of dollars to a “dark money” organization called Generation Now that Householder’s team set up in Delaware.",
    "“House Bill 6 was really a coal bailout wrapped in a clean energy and nuclear argument,” said Stokes, who wrote about the episode in her book, Short Circuiting Energy Policy.",
    "If petitioners gathered enough signatures to allow the public to vote on it, Householder and his team knew there was a solid chance that residents would reject House Bill 6.",
    "The technical term for a dark money group is a 501(c)(4), a form of nonprofit that can spend money in politics without revealing anything about where that money comes from.",
    "Ohioans risked losing their $10 billion investment in nuclear power, the utility argued, along with thousands of jobs and 15 percent of the state’s electricity generation.",
    "In his memoir, published posthumously, Clark wrote of the pain his family endured because his father was a mafia gunslinger who spent most of Clark’s childhood in prison.",
    "“There’s been a pretty sweeping blizzard of subpoenas in Ohio, which suggests that a lot of people could go to jail before this is over,” said Anderson of Energy Policy.",
    "There’s evidence they were right: As lawsuits loomed, Energy Harbor opted to decline the nuclear bailout and announced that its plants would not need to close after all.",
    "The story has all the details of a potboiler — hidden recorders, damning conversations, a suicide, bribes, dirty politicians, and corrupt companies that financed it all.",
    "Ever since the 1870s, when Standard Oil monopolized the petroleum industry, big companies dealing in fossil fuels have tried to bend the political process to their will.",
    "Two years later, the utility FirstEnergy, one of the largest investor-owned utilities in America, took it a step further, emboldened by its recent legislative victory.",
    "(Though he hasn’t been charged, DeWine himself received more than $1.2 million dollars from utilities and their dark money groups for his election campaign in 2017.)",
    "And things went upside down fast, and that’s what propelled me into politics in the first place.”\n“They got a lot of faith in us,” he swallowed and nodded stiffly.",
    "But nuclear power was mostly a red herring that utilities used to distract from the real thrust of the law: keeping obsolete coal plants and coal mines profitable.",
    "It threw red tape at wind energy projects, with a budget rider requiring bigger buffer zones around turbines than the state requires for fracking or coal mining.",
    "An executive from the former SCANA Corporation pled guilty to defrauding ratepayers in an attempt to get an expensive new nuclear plant built in South Carolina.",
    "At the same time, it would provide funding for a few token solar farms while handing over a billion dollars to energy companies, ostensibly for nuclear power.",
    "So Ohio’s fossil fuel industry, represented by utilities like Akron-based FirstEnergy and coal giant Murray Energy, began flooding the statehouse with money.",
    "His name was Larry Householder, insurance man, gentleman farmer, and the powerful leader of a Republican supermajority in the Ohio House of Representatives.",
    "On a warm morning in July of 2020, FBI agents and local sheriff’s deputies converged on a farmhouse just outside the tiny town of Glenford in central Ohio.",
    "Few saw any reason to oppose the measure — it came after a parade of states passed their own renewable electricity standards, beginning in the late 1990s.",

    "Over the course of four years, FBI investigators tapped phones, recruited informants, and traced the movement of money between Householder and utilities.",
