    "LONDON, Ohio (WCMH) — An award of $9.2 million to the Attorney General’s office and $1.3 million to the Ohio State Highway Patrol will give access to ballistics testing machines for every law enforcement department in Ohio.",
    "My hope is that we will see law enforcement across the state flooding BCI and highway patrol with tests.”\nTo begin the tests, the seized weapon is fired and the casing compared against a database, the video explained.",
    "Two will go to the OSHP, which currently outsources its ballistics testing to other Ohio labs, and two others will be transportable units to test on-site evidence in rural parts of the state, according to DeWine.",
    "The National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) uses machines which compare cartridge cases from firearms and crime scenes, as explained by a video shown at a Thursday news conference in London.",
    "But the two police departments don’t know they exist.”\nNIBIN matches them up, and now those two separate files can be combined and that information is getting you closer to the bad guy.",
    "“I expect the match rates to go up dramatically with the increased capacity and the increased submissions from law enforcement and easier access from the mobile units,” Yost said.",
    "The machines are expected arrive in Ohio at least six months from now, after the state makes its formal submission to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
    "The $10.5 million in funding will be used to place five of the new machines at the BCI’s state crime labs in London, Bowling Green and Richfield, DeWine said.",
    "Then the data is sent to the police department to let them know whether there is a match between the cartridge submitted, firearm, and other cases.",
    "Now in Cincinnati, where they had hundreds of thousands of shots fired according to ShotSpotter… somewhere over there you have a match.",
    "Attorney General Yost gave an example at the end of the press conference about how this will close the net around criminals.",
    "“We hope that because of this initiative, it will become standard practice for law enforcement to have these run,” Gov.",
    "The first person searches for marks and firing pin impressions, and the second person verifies the test.",
    "Many agencies in Ohio haven’t been able to test the guns or shell casings they’ve seized.",
    "“But say that same guy is bringing [drugs] down into Cincinnati and across the river.",
    "Every law enforcement agency in Ohio will have access to a machine, free of charge.",
    "The grants will more than double the number of NIBIN machines, from seven to 16.",
    "He said that there might be shots fired in Portsmouth, but nobody gets killed.",
    "“We will take another look at it in six months and see how it’s working.",
    "The NIBIN machine requires two pairs of human eyes on the casing data.",
    "The NIBIN database will allow them to do that, the governor explained.",
    "“You might have attempted assault, but nothing else, no evidence.",
    "Two machines will also be put to use in rural Ohio.",
    "“That’s why this tool is so powerful,” Yost said.",
    "“Police respond, collect the brass,” Yost said.",
    "Are you going to send that up to Columbus?",
    "Mike DeWine said."
