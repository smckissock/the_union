    "Brad Little also being primaried by the state’s lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin.”\n“Little has not publicly drawn Trump’s ire as Kemp has,” Montellaro explains, “but the former president nevertheless backed McGeachin, an early supporter of his with ties to the far right — including a virtual appearance at the America First Political Action Conference in February, which was hosted by a White nationalist.”\nThe white nationalist Montellaro is referring to is Nick Fuentes, a Holocaust denier.",
    "“Both allies and opponents of Trump see the May primaries as a test of his staying power, believing the outcome will offer signs of how powerful he remains two years out from the next presidential election.”\nMontellaro points out that “many Republican candidates” have been “clamoring for Trump’s endorsement.” One candidate Trump has endorsed is former Sen. David Perdue, who is challenging incumbent Georgia Gov.",
    "Sanders — who was being floated as a potential gubernatorial candidate while she was still working at the White House, including by Trump publicly — eventually cleared the field of prominent challengers in the state, including the sitting lieutenant governor and attorney general.”\nMontellaro adds, “The second open race comes in Nebraska and pits Trump against outgoing incumbent Gov.",

    "Journalist Zach Montellaro, in an article published by Politico on April 6, stresses that GOP gubernatorial primaries in “more than half a dozen states” in May have “turned into mini-referendums on the former president” — and it remains to be seen how the candidates Trump has endorsed will perform compared the ones he hasn’t endorsed.",
    "“A Fox News poll released last month had Kemp leading Perdue by 11 points among Republican primary voters, even with Trump being overwhelmingly popular among Georgia Republicans.”\nKemp, Montellaro notes, is “one of two incumbent Republican governors facing a Trump-endorsed primary challenge in May, with Idaho Gov.",
    "Between President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election, the January 6, 2021 insurrection, Donald Trump’s second impeachment and Democrats regaining control of the U.S. Senate, Republicans have had plenty of reasons to distance themselves from the United States’ former president.",

    "Mike DeWine is facing GOP primary challenges from Trumpistas Joe Blyston and Jim Renacci (a former congressman).",
    "So far, Trump hasn’t endorsed either Blystone or Renacci, and polls are showing DeWine as the frontrunner.",
    "“A recent Fox News poll had DeWine at 50%, with Blystone at 21% and Renacci at 18%,” Montellaro observes.",
    "“Renacci, in particular, has tried to lean into his Trump connections during the race.”",
    "Pete Ricketts — who is also the co-chair of the (Republican Governors Association).",
