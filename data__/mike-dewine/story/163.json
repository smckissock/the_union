    "The response added: “A new plan could be approved in the coming days,” and requested the court “either withhold judgment on contempt for the time being or find that neither the commission nor any of its members should be held in contempt.”\nThe court last Friday ordered the commission to respond by Wednesday as to why it shouldn’t be held in contempt after the five Republicans on the seven-member commission declared an impasse Feb. 17 in approving state legislative district maps that comply with the Ohio Constitution and the rulings of the high court.",

    "“The court should reserve judgment on any contempt filing for the time being because despite the commission’s inability to meet the Feb. 17 deadline — which some members noted was difficult, if not impossible, to meet as a matter of timing — the commission is presently continuing its efforts to pass a compliant map,” commission attorneys wrote in a Wednesday response.",
    "The court has twice rejected state legislative maps approved by the commission’s Republican members in 4-3 decisions declaring both unconstitutional over gerrymandering issues and because they didn’t comply with the 54 percent Republican to 46 percent Democratic voting trends in statewide elections over the past decade.",
    "This would raise serious separation of power issues.”\nBut the filing from Russo and Sykes stated: “The judiciary is a co-equal, not subordinate, branch of government and, important here, it is the branch of government charged with enforcing constitutional mandates.",
    "The separate Republican responses all stated there were no grounds for contempt of court charges, the individual members couldn’t be held responsible for how the others voted and the threat of contempt would violate the state constitution’s separation of powers.",
    "In response to an order from the Ohio Supreme Court as to why it shouldn’t be held in contempt of court for failing to have constitutional state legislative maps by an imposed deadline, the Ohio Redistricting Commission asked for more time.",
    "The two Democratic members — Ohio House Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, and state Sen. Vernon Sykes, D-Akron — voted Feb. 17 in favor of a Democratic-drawn map that the Republican members said was unconstitutional.",
    "Nor do they believe that the commission would have been unable to pass a constitutional map if given more time.”\nThe response from Russo and Sykes said: “The commission failed to comply with the court’s Feb. 7 order.",
    "If it could, it could simply order every commission member to vote in a certain way, even if it violated the conscience of the member and render the commission itself — a constitutionally created body — a nullity.",
    "Despite Republican commission members declaring an impasse last week, LaRose and Faber wrote in their response that they did “not believe that the Ohio Redistricting (Commission) is at an impasse.",
    "Cupp and Huffman wrote they “have immunity regarding their actions and votes regarding the commission’s work.”\nThey added the two “cannot be coerced in the performance of these duties.",
    "We apologize to the court for the commission’s failures.”\nThe Republican members in responses said the court can’t find them in contempt because of the separation of powers.",
    "Mike DeWine; one from Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Auditor Keith Faber; and one from House Speaker Bob Cupp and Senate President Matt Huffman, both Lima Republicans.",
    "The commission’s majority members seem to have forgotten that.”\nThe court will consider the responses and make a decision, though it isn’t known when.",
    "In addition to the commission’s court filing Wednesday, four other responses came from commission members: one from Russo and Sykes; one from Gov.",
    "The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that a congressional map adopted by the Republican-controlled state Legislature was unconstitutional.",
    "If contempt hearings occur, Justice Pat DeWine, a son of the governor, said he would recuse himself from those proceedings.",
    "Those found to be in contempt of court for the first time face up to 30 days in jail and a $250 fine.",
    "Meanwhile, the commission also is working on a U.S. House of Representatives map.",
    "Nor can the court do so through a threat of contempt."
