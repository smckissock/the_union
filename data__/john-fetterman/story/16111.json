    "The jockeying for his support has already led to massive spending -- especially in Pennsylvania, where the GOP primary has attracted $18 million, mostly in December and January alone, according to a CNN analysis of AdImpact data.",
    "But it remains a question, as is the case in several other races, how much embracing former President Donald Trump in the primary comes back to haunt the eventual GOP nominee in the general election in a state Biden won in 2020.",
    "\"Now we have Nancy Pelosi's gazpacho police spying on members of Congress, spying on the legislative work that we do, spying on our staff and spying on American citizens that want to come to talk with their representatives.\"",
    "It's less clear, however, whether the voters who will decide control of the Senate nine months from now are attuned to that conversation, especially since the ideological makeup of the court is not in the balance.",
    "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., leader of the progressive Squad in Congress, said the screw-up shows Greene, who also favors banning books that expose racial injustice, needs to go back to school.",
    "The right-wing firebrand laughed off comments made during an interview with One American Network (OAN) complaining House Speaker Pelosi was secretly investigating members of Congress and constituents.",
    "Last year, the conservative agitator was forced to apologize for affronting people with recent comments comparing the required wearing of safety masks in the House to the horrors of the Holocaust.",

    "As he resumes his campaign-style rallies, with a heavy focus on his 2020 election lies, Trump is signaling that he won't be sitting 2022 out quietly, even if he's not on the ballot.",
    "\"I'm truly sorry for offending people with remarks about the Holocaust,\" the Georgia Republican told reporters outside the Capitol, saying she had visited Washington's U.S.",
    "Mark Kelly, Catherine Cortez Masto, Maggie Hassan and Raphael Warnock -- all voted in favor of eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation.",
    "Even though Greene laughed off her own verbal slip-up, this is not her first flawed reference comparing American politics to Nazis and the Holocaust.",
    "Still, the seat most likely to flip partisan control is the place where Democrats see the Supreme Court vacancy as having perhaps the biggest impact.",
