    "“And frankly, I don’t know how anyone can look at today’s disaster and think we can afford to wait any longer on investing in our infrastructure.”\nA total of 80 Allegheny County bridges owned by the City of Pittsburgh and other municipalities are also listed as being in poor condition, as are 96 bridges owned by the state.",
    "Tom Wolf said it was “a miracle” that no one died in the collapse, and John Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, called the sight of the crumbled bridge “surreal.”\n“I just want these bridges fixed as a dude who drives his kids over them almost every day,” he wrote in a Jan. 29 blog post on Medium.",

    "Days after the collapse of the Fern Hollow bridge in the East End, a massive crane carefully lifted a Port Authority bus high into the air and back onto solid ground late Monday afternoon.",
    "Over the weekend, the bus routes were detoured along South Dallas Avenue to Penn Avenue and through Wilkinsburg before emerging on South Braddock Avenue to rejoin the original route.",
    "Even as the injured continue to recover, it’s a number that could’ve been higher if it hadn’t happened so early on a morning when many schools had announced two-hour weather delays.",
    "We’re going to look at the entire history of this bridge … up until the day of the collapse.”\nHomendy also said a preliminary report from the NTSB will be ready in about 10 days.",
    "Pittsburgh Public Safety announced Monday afternoon that a public observation area for the Fern Hollow collapse site will be established on the Squirrel Hill side of the bridge.",
    "Regional traffic should use the Parkway East instead of Penn Avenue, and local drivers and residents are instructed to follow South Dallas to Penn Avenue to South Braddock.",
    "It isn’t yet clear what exactly caused the bridge in Frick Park to fall, and experts say it could be months or even a year before a definitive cause is released.",
    "“With the support of our county, state and federal partners, we will build back better.”\nBut building a permanent replacement for the bridge could take years.",
    "It was the main thoroughfare for public transit, too; two Port Authority bus routes — the 61A and 61B — cross it more than 200 times per day combined.",
    "It will be open from dawn to dusk, with officers in the area at all times, and it can be accessed by walking down Forbes Avenue from South Dallas.",
    "While 10 victims sustained injuries — including two who suffered fractured vertebrae — there were no deaths, and only four total hospitalizations.",
    "The bus was removed a few hours after most of Frick Park was reopened except for the areas closest to the scene of Friday’s bridge collapse.",
    "More than 7% of all bridges in the U.S. have been given a poor rating, according to National Transportation Board’s Chair Jennifer Homendy.",
    "At least 100 feet of street parking has also been temporarily eliminated next to the Forbes/Braddock playground to improve traffic flow.",
    "“We hope to conclude everything and have a final report out [in] between 12 to 18 months, and we hope it’s less,” she said.",
    "Without salt, the icy surface of a frozen bridge could cause drivers to veer off into the guard rails, or into each other.",
    "Folks are still reminded to avoid the closed-off perimeter of the collapse site because of an array of potential hazards.",
    "The downed bridge has also led to considerable disruptions for those who rely on it as part of their daily commute.",

    "“We’re looking for things like signs of corrosion, signs of fatigue cracking,” she said.",
    "“As the City of Bridges, we know how critical our infrastructure is to working families.",
    "Harries also said that bridges aren’t necessarily more likely to collapse in the winter.",
    "On Sunday, Mayor Ed Gainey signed a Declaration of Disaster Emergency for the city.",
