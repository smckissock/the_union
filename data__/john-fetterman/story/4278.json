    "“The COO of the company has taken away the scheduling powers of some managers and refuses to schedule these baristas their usual hours, interfering with income they depend on.”\nThe union campaign also says that management has promised unspecified benefits if baristas vote against a union, recalling, “One of the union busters has been at several locations posing as the new ‘Employee Relations Manager,’ stating that he had a lot of new benefits in the works, but it was all up in the air now, because of our union effort.",
    "Additionally, baristas are being told that they had raises coming in the near future, but they can’t get them because of this campaign.”\nWorkers also say management offered modest raises to the Shadyside store and demanded they not tell workers at other stores and have abruptly begun writing up employees “excessively.”\nCoffee Tree management did not respond to a request for comment.",
    "They accuse management of trying to intimidate workers via surveillance, writing, “on Sun., Jan. 2, the owner’s sister visited the Shadyside location with a man and they proceeded to film three vocal union supporters that were working behind the bar as an intimidation tactic.”\nWorkers say the hours of many pro-union baristas have been cut.",
