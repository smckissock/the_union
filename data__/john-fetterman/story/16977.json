    "He’s also neutralized an issue that has caused problems for other progressive candidates with pro-Israel groups: Jewish Insider obtained a letter he wrote to a local rabbi confirming that he does not support the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, though he does back “restricting aid from being used in a manner that violates basic rights.”\nThat announcement led the Austin chapter of Democratic Socialists of America to withdraw their endorsement of Casar.",
    "“While the Texas primaries haven’t engaged the full force of the far-left versus the center-left, there are lots of races on the horizon where that will be true, and they will be far more telling tests,” said Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, which invested more than $2 million in Ohio to block Sanders-backed Nina Turner from winning a special primary there against now-Rep. Shontel Brown.",
    "Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, argued that some centrist groups are staying out of Texas primaries because “they don’t want a loss on their record by getting involved in primaries where progressives are doing better than their hawks.”\nPlenty more primaries after Tuesday will continue to pit the left against moderate or establishment-aligned Democrats, including a rematch between Turner and Brown.",
    "“Come November, expanding the size of the Senate [caucus] and picking up the Pennsylvania and Wisconsin seats would create the conditions where we won’t be subject to the Manchin or the Sinema veto.”\nThe left’s gambit starts in south Texas, where Cisneros is challenging Cuellar, a conservative Democrat who opposes abortion rights, in a rematch after losing to him by only 4 percentage points in 2020.",
    "Cuellar’s TV ads have hammered Cisneros for “attacking Henry Cuellar to distract from her agenda” because it “won’t fly here,” flashing graphics that say she’s “backed by the defund the police movement.”\n“I think it’s going to be close, closer than it was two years ago,” said Hector Nieto, a Texas-based Democratic strategist who is not working on the primary and hails from Laredo.",
    "And in some ways, I think it might be a message that the administration and Democrats haven’t done enough.”\nDespite the stakes, the Texas primaries haven’t drawn blockbuster spending in the same way that a 2021 Ohio special election became a magnet for national groups and donors — nor has this group of Texas candidates triggered as many objections from moderate organizations.",
    "A trio of progressive-backed candidates in Texas — Jessica Cisneros, Greg Casar and Jasmine Crockett — could offer up early clues on messaging, too, like whether the left can successfully cast centrists as impediments to President Joe Biden’s agenda, or whether Democratic voters worry progressives have gone too far on issues like the “Defund the Police” movement.",
    "“Progressive victories here in the beginning of the year in Texas can show a path that if we don’t back away from progressive issues and really talk about progressives being the folks willing to deliver, then that might help chart a path for Democrats and make this a better year for us all,” Casar said in an interview with POLITICO.",
    "“These three candidates showing a strong finish and winning will send the president and the rest of the Democratic Party a very clear message: Progressive policies are popular and the voters don’t want moderation and centrism in this moment,” said Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of Our Revolution.",
    "Some members, like Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Dina Titus (D-Nev.), are facing primary challenges from Sanders-style candidates, while redistricting in Illinois and Michigan drew Democratic incumbents into primaries against each other, which could prompt progressive and moderate outside spending.",
    "Instead, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who faces Cisneros, has forged ahead alone after the FBI raided his home earlier this year, and the other two open primaries haven’t drawn much attention from big-spending centrist Democratic groups like Democratic Majority for Israel or Third Way.",
    "Over the last year, he attracted even more fury from liberals when he joined Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and other centrist Democrats in threatening to block the party’s budget unless the House first passed bipartisan infrastructure legislation.",
    "And after a wave of retirements and new maps in a redistricting year, progressives have an unusually large number of opportunities to muscle their preferred candidates through primaries and could fundamentally change the Democratic caucus.",
    "Now, Texas is kicking off a primary season that could reshape the contours of the Democratic Party in Congress, which is staring down a brutal midterm environment that will potentially lead to a smaller caucus in 2023.",
    "Cisneros and allied outside groups have zeroed in on the FBI raid, while also taking a page from progressive insurgents such as Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and painting Cuellar as out-of-touch.",
    "“Adding three progressives to the House caucus would be a boon to creating a more coherent and more pro-Biden-agenda caucus in the House,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party.",
    "Progressives are on the hunt to grow their numbers in Congress, after a year of legislative showdowns and intense infighting that pitted them against the more centrist Democratic lawmakers such as Sens.",
    "But unlike in 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer did not stump for Cuellar, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is not currently spending any money on it.",
    "Though it is less of a focus, some progressives have also thrown their weight behind Crockett, a state representative and Our Revolution member running to replace retiring Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson.",

    "Casar is squaring off against longtime state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, who picked up an endorsement from the New Democrat Coalition Action Fund, a group that backs moderate congressional candidates.",
    "Casar spearheaded liberal priorities in Austin, cutting funding to the city’s police department and loosening rules for the unhoused population, allowing tent encampments to pop up in the city.",
    "I’m a solutions-based legislator.”\nBut Casar has marshaled a powerful campaign, leading the primary in fundraising and drawing big stars to stump on his behalf.",
    "Some moderate groups said the relative lack of spending means Tuesday’s elections won’t be a genuine measure of centrist versus liberal power in the party.",
    "The left is hoping to make a show of force that will provide a jolt of momentum, attention and money for candidates in other states in the coming months.",
    "Several of the eight other Democrats are putting in strong pushes, including Jane Hope Hamilton, who served as Biden’s 2020 state director in Texas.",
    "Both Casar and Rodriguez call themselves progressive, but the differences are “about tone and style,” Rodriguez said in an interview with POLITICO.",
    "A Justice Democrats super PAC spent more than $500,000 combined on TV, mail and digital ads in the Cisneros and Casar races, the organization said.",
    "Progressives spent 2021 getting rolled in election after election, losing congressional races and high-profile mayoral contests across the map.",

    "In the Senate, Pennsylvania’s Democratic primary also features a battle between the left wing of the party, represented by Lt. Gov.",
    "“A lot of people say ‘Manchin, Manchin, Manchin,’” Ocasio-Cortez said at a rally for Cisneros at a San Antonio rally this month.",
    "Sanders isn’t on the ballot like he was in 2020 to energize the progressive base, and Cuellar is more prepared this time around.",
    "Progressive groups are targeting House races in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Colorado, North Carolina and Oregon as well.",
    "Left-wing heavyweights are rallying around a slate of candidates running in congressional primaries from Dallas to Laredo.",
    "Still, liberals believe that this is the most difficult of the three congressional races they’ve targeted in Texas.",
    "Henry Cuellar.”\nProgressives were handed a gift when the FBI raided Cuellar’s home and campaign office in January.",
    "“A good showing on election night is going to send a message that people want fighters in positions of power.",
