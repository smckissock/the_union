    "[Sen. Heidi Heitkamp] said Democrats are hurting themselves by not speaking out more forcefully against far-left positions that alienate rural voters, such as the push to “defund the police.”\nWhile only a handful of Democrats in Congress support stripping such money from police departments, for example, conservative media popular in rural communities — particularly Fox News — amplifies such positions.",
    "“I just don’t know how Republicans will be able to offset the losses in suburban and exurban communities with increasing tallies from rural voters.”\nThe LA Times: “In California, Trump’s political poison spreads from top of the ticket to City Hall”\nThere was a time, not even a decade ago, when Republicans held roughly half the 2,500 mayoral and city council seats in California.",
    "Yesterday Jazz wrote about an Associated Press story headlined “‘The brand is so toxic’: Dems fear extinction in rural US.” The gist of the story is that some Democrats worry their party could be wiped out in rural areas in states like Pennsylvania because the party has become so associated with far left views.",
    "… Now, the brand is so toxic that people who are Democrats, the ones left, aren’t fighting for the party.”\nIn response to this article, a left-leaning blogger named David Roberts wrote a Twitter thread which has been hailed as a work of staggering genius by quite a few aggrieved Democrats.",
    "The former small-town mayor drove his black Dodge Ram pickup truck across five rural counties last weekend to face voters who almost never see statewide Democratic candidates…\n“These are the kind of places that matter just as much as any other place,” Fetterman said as the crowd cheered.",
    "“I just couldn’t deal with it.”\nHere’s another from the New Yorker: “Trump Is Poison for Suburban Republicans—So Why Won’t They Turn on Him?”\nThe shift from red to blue in places like Fairfax County started well before Trump arrived on the scene, of course.",
    "Before you say I’m cherry-picking by pointing to the Squad as if they are representative of all Democrats, consider that there are currently 226 Democrats in the House and 97 of them are members of the progressive caucus chaired by Pramila Jayapal.",
    "“There continues to be bloodletting and further erosion of suburban voters from the GOP,” Charlie Dent, a veteran Pennsylvania Republican who retired from a U.S. House seat in Lehigh Valley last year, told the Philadelphia Inquirer.",
    "In Pennsylvania, which is crucial to Trump’s reëlection hopes, the Democrats took control of local governments in three leafy but populous counties north and west of Philadelphia: Bucks County, Chester County, and Delaware County.",
    "— David Roberts (@drvolts) February 17, 2022\nHis argument here is that rural voters are reacting to lies and conspiracies and definitely not to “real-life Dems.” Are Rep. Ocasio Cortez and Rep. Cori Bush real-life Dems?",
    "Roberts says (top tweets above) this effort is pointless because these voters will only hear lies about politicians like Fetterman, but the story actually says people cheered for him when he made the effort to show up.",
    "Then Trump Came Along.”\nRepublicans are now outnumbered by Democrats in Manhattan by nearly eight to one, and some prominent New Yorkers like Joseph Lhota, the 2013 Republican candidate for mayor, have left the party.",
    "But the takeaway from Tuesday’s election confirms what we saw in last year’s midterms: Trump is accelerating these long-term trends and spreading poison for Republican candidates in the suburbs.",
    "Problem is, we've let that practical need to over-value rural votes bleed into a kind of mythology that rural votes are somehow more important, more authentic, more *American* than urban votes.",
    "The GOP decline is “happening everywhere,” said Robb Korinke, who crunched the numbers for GrassrootsLab, a firm that conducts nonpartisan research on local government throughout the state.",
    "If all of those groups had utterly written off the GOP then Democrats would have a nice supermajority in Congress and wouldn’t be facing a historic shellacking later this year.",
    "Most of the commentary comes from concerned Democrats who are warning that their party is ignoring rural voters rather than making an effort to connect with them, i.e.",
    "Granted they aren’t all Democratic Socialists like AOC but there are quite a lot of real-Dems who self-identify as being part of the left flank of the party.",
    "The only votes that matter, the ones that vouchsafe your candidate & party as Truly American, are the ones that are objectively the most ignorant & deluded.",
    "Those are statistical facts, but merely to state them is to invite a landslide of accusations: arrogant elites, looking down the hicks in flyover country!",
    "Just look at coverage of the Rittenhouse trial or the Michael Brown shooting or ask Democrats how many unarmed black men are shot each year by the police.",
    "Consider: have you ever, in your life, a single time, seen a piece in mainstream media framing it as a problem that the GOP has completely lost cities?",
    "It is largely driven by demographic factors, including an influx of new voters who tend to be younger, highly educated, and more ethnically diverse.",
    "Also, sorry to bring this up, but mockery of the constitution is probably one of those things that rural voters don’t care for very much.",
    "Of course that’s not how the House works which is why some states lost representatives after the 2020 census and others gained them.",
    "It doesn't matter what Fetterman or any other ostentatiously in-touch-with-working-people candidate says — they'll never hear it!",
    "“We’re letting Republicans use the language of the far left to define the Democratic Party, and we can’t do that,” Heitkamp said.",
    "— David Roberts (@drvolts) February 17, 2022\nHe’s referring to the Senate which gives equal power to states regardless of size.",
    "If you go back to the original piece, it’s not faux populism written by people who are ignoring the diverse, urban population.",
    "John Fetterman, a leading candidate in the Senate contest, insists his party can no longer afford to ignore rural voters.",
    "These accusations are ubiquitous, not only from the right but from lefties keen to burnish their populist bona fides.",
    "— David Roberts (@drvolts) February 17, 2022\nI’m not going to prove his point by jumping on him for stating this.",
    "My recommendation: Democrats should definitely not send David Roberts into rural areas to drum up votes.",
    "Instead, the Dem Party is cast as vaguely *suspicious* for commanding the loyalty of those demographics.",
    "That’s roughly 43% of House Democrats who are pushing for “climate justice” and universal healthcare.",
    "I have to think David Roberts didn’t look very hard before claiming articles like this didn’t exist.",
    "Democrats, including urban and minority voters, have different blind spots but they do have them.",
    "Yes, I’ve seen mainstream media pieces framing the problem as Republicans having a toxic brand.",
    "Granted they often focus on suburbs, not just urban areas but it’s the same basic message, i.e.",
    "The \"Dems\" that people in these areas hate bear virtually no resemblance to real-life Dems.",
    "I will say that I don’t think urban voters always have a more accurate view of the world.",
    "The problem is that even with that being the case, the country is pretty evenly divided.",
    "Today, that number has fallen to just about a third while Democrats now hold a majority.",
    "As for the claim about the framing of this piece, Roberts is wrong about that too.",
    "Joe Biden won the White House in 2020 but Democrats lost a bunch of House seats.",
    "— David Roberts (@drvolts) February 17, 2022\nIt’s just not true of course.",
    "— David Roberts (@drvolts) February 17, 2022\nSorry but that’s just wrong.",
    "“It had to do with Donald Trump, as head of the party,” Mr. Lhota said.",
    "Are any Republicans taken to task for that or forced to answer for it?",
    "That's a super-dumb feature of the constitution, but it is what it is.",
    "Democrats also sometimes believe things that aren’t remotely true.",
    "Trump is killing the GOP brand in these increasingly blue areas.",
    "But he’s right that there are fewer rural voters these days.",
    "L.A., places like the San Gabriel Valley and South Bay.",
    "But give him points for pushing the smug button again.",
    "“The trend lines in rural America are very, very bad.",
    "That the party's brand is \"toxic\" in urban areas?",
    "Orange County, places like Irvine and Fullerton.",
    "The Bay Area managed to get bluer than it was.",
    "San Diego.”\nThere are a lot more like this.",
    "Here’s one from the NY Times titled “N.Y.C.",
