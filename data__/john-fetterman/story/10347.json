    "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The process for inmates and ex-convicts in Pennsylvania to apply for clemency should go fully online by the end of the year, an effort to improve access to an emerging cornerstone of the nation’s criminal justice movement and to reduce the wait by years, Lt. Gov.",

    "Fetterman said at a Capitol news conference that his goal is for the state Board of Pardons to use the online system to turn around an application for a pardon or commutation in a year or less.",
    "The process often takes several years currently under what Fetterman calls an ineffective and paper-based system.",
    "After taking office in 2019, Fetterman got rid of the fees and applications can now be downloaded from online.",
    "Follow Marc Levy on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/timelywriter.",
    "April is recognized nationally as Second Chance Month.",
