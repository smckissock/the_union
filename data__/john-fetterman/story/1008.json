    "A GOP Senate candidate on Sunday ran a Super Bowl ad repeating the conservative political slogan \"Let's Go Brandon\" – a minced oath for \"F*ck Joe Biden.\"",
    "While McCormick hails from a bygone era of Republican \"respectability,\" his latest ad indicates that he is willing to join the fold of Trumpism.",
    "In an interview announcing his ad, McCormick told Fox News that \"the issues we are facing are so much bigger than 'Brandon.'\"",
    "Since then, the phrase has taken hold amongst right-wingers as a way to insult President Biden without naming him directly.",
    "He is vying to replace Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., who in 2020 indicated that he would not be running for re-election.",
