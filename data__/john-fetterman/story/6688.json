    "Amid touting Oz's many dubious credentials, Trump added, \"He even said that I was in extraordinary health, which made me like him even more (although he also said I should lose a couple of pounds!).\"",
    "But the money quote came from Breitbart Editor Joel Pollak, who predicted: \"This endorsement could divide MAGA in the only way that matters: he could lose America First conservatives over it.\"",
    "“I have enormous respect for President Trump,” wrote Trump's first endorsee for the seat, alleged wife abuser Sean Parnell, who dropped out after losing custody of his children.",

    "It's not that the GOP frontrunner for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat didn't try to sell his soul to the devil, it's just that the devil wouldn't take it.",

    "“This is all about winning elections in order to stop the radical left maniacs from destroying our country,” Trump said in his statement.",
    "Former Trump associate Roger Stone posted a pic to Telegram of Oz on set with former First Lady Michelle Obama and queried, \"Wait ?",
    "That's an internal poll by a pro-Lamb group trying to cast doubt on the electoral prospects of another Democrat, so grain of salt.",
    "Anyway, impressive pick by Trump—snubbing his extremist base while passing over the guy who likely has the edge with suburbanites.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "Instead, Donald Trump endorsed a guy whose soul status, as it were, was never in question—celebrity TV healther Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
    "We are primarily accountable to readers like you because donations from readers like you are our biggest source of income.",
    "Right-winger John Cardillo posited, \"Even money odds Dr. Oz will eventually switch parties and f'k over PA voters.",
    "Trump \"just put his political capital behind an anti-gun pro-abortion open borders Hollywood liberal,\" he added.",

    "I guess we’ll find in the next few weeks how much this endorsement made a difference.\"",
