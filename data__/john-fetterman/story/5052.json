    "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — AP is reporting… The first live-televised prime-time debate between leading candidates for the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania’s open U.S. Senate seat exposed differences between the rivals Thursday night, as they seized opportunities to attack each other.",
    "Perhaps the longest and sharpest exchange came over a question about a 2013 incident when, shotgun in hand, John Fetterman confronted someone who he believed to be involved with gunfire on a nearby street in Braddock, where Fetterman was mayor.",
    "It was, to a great extent, a reprisal of previous criticism of Fetterman mounted by state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia and U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb of suburban Pittsburgh — but not with Fetterman standing a few feet away between them.",
    "The race in the premier presidential battleground state is perhaps the Democratic Party’s best opportunity to pick up a seat in the closely divided Senate.",
    "Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor, Kenyatta and Lamb appeared at the studio of WHTM-TV in Harrisburg for the one-hour debate.",
    "The debate also exposed differences over whether they would vote to suspend the federal gas tax amid sky-high gas prices.",
    "Kenyatta would end new natural gas drilling leases in an effort to clamp down on planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
    "Fetterman and Lamb, however, contend that natural gas is a fuel the country’s economy needs for now.",
    "The candidates at many points sought to portray each other as flip-floppers or hypocrites.",
    "On energy, the debate made plainer a long-standing difference.",
    "The primary election is May 17."
