    "Joe Biden’s incoherence on immigration and border policy has Democrats running away from the White House, almost literally:\nOn Monday, Sen.

    "“And look, we don’t only need a long-term and detailed plan here for ending Title 42, but we still need to fix our broken immigration system as a whole.”\nFetterman is certainly not on an island.",
    "It’s the latest move to address soaring gas prices but also the latest to enrage environmental advocates — armed this time with a Biden campaign pledge to the contrary.",
    "Incumbent Democrats in states including Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire are raising concerns that Title 42 is being lifted too quickly.",
    "His presidency has consisted entirely of Biden’s political impulses, followed by gimmicky attempts to mitigate the damage done by indulging in them.",

    "But I share … concerns of some of my colleagues,” Peters told reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday, according to Jordain Carney of the Hill.",
    "And it’s not just current Senate Democrats either, but the prospective recruits that are balking at Biden’s attempts to lift Title 42.",
    "Biden didn’t have a coherent plan for supply chains, the economy, withdrawal from Afghanistan, the pandemic, inflation — nothing.",

    "“We should not end Title 42 until we have a detailed plan in place,” Fetterman told POLITICO this weekend.",
    "“It’s going to be a crisis on top of a crisis.”\nNews flash: this administration never has a plan.",
