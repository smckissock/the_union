    "However, we are extremely concerned about the process for developing these recommendations and their potential impact on the healthcare provided to the veterans we serve.”\nUnder the nearly $2 trillion proposal released last month, the Veterans Affairs Department would lose a net of three medical centers and 174 outpatient health clinics but would gain 255 health care facilities, including new clinics, stand-alone rehabilitation centers and nursing homes.",
    "They added: “We are also deeply concerned that the recommendations consistently refer to non-VA community providers as having sufficient resources – staff and beds – to accommodate the increase in demand from veterans who currently receive care at the Coatesville VAMC, Philadelphia VAMC, and other community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) that the report identified for restructuring or closure.",

    "“Veterans represent the best of our nation, and they deserve our care once they return home from war — a terrible reality we are seeing play out on televisions across the world right now,” said Houlahan.",
    "I’ve spent countless hours at the Coatesville VAMC with veterans and the dedicated staff who support them, and I will not stand for any loss of accessible, quality care.",
    "The Veteran’s Affairs Department has recommended closing 17 of its 171 medical centers, among them the Coatesville Veterans Administration Center in Caln Township.",
    "VA officials cited a declining population, demographic changes, aging conditions of some facilities and difficulty in recruiting to justify its proposed closures.",
    "This data was compiled before the COVID pandemic and before multiple medical facilities in Southeastern Pennsylvania announced their closure.",
    "“We also realize these are, at the moment, only recommendations to the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission and are not finalized.",
    "The recommendation is the first step in an asset and infrastructure review required by Congress in the Mission Act of 2018.",
    "The Coatesville VA has 302 operating beds and more than 1,300 employees, one of the largest employers in the region.",
