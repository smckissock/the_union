    "He had no facts; he was just kind-of throwing shade out there…”Well, we don’t know if we’re going to open an investigation…” So I submitted a public documents request to his office asking, “What investigation did you do into $4.2 million in Zuckerbucks in our state used for purchasing drop boxes for every county?” It was a few weeks later that I got a response stating there was no investigation at all.",
