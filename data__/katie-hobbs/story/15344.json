    "“She single-handedly saved the education-funding initiative in court and ultimately bought enough time for it to succeed at the ballot as well.”\nOpponents of the measure were so confident that their legal challenge to the 100-word summary of the measure would succeed that they apparently were not ready to begin advertising against the measure after Desai defeated their challenge in court, Pearson said.",
    "I think that is part of the reason why she is able to work with others on the other side of the aisle because she doesn’t burn the bridges that way.”\nDesai has been a critical part of the legal teams that defended the Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, and the Arizona Democratic Party in multiple cases that all were unsuccessful in reversing the election.",
    "Then Desai and colleagues at the Coppersmith Brockelman law firm filed suit on behalf of a left-leaning watchdog group from Washington, D.C., known as American Oversight, to access texts, emails and other records from Cyber Ninjas and its subcontractors that the Senate and the companies were not making public under the state Public Records Law.",

    "“When trying to make big improvements like criminal justice reform, you really can’t do it with one side cramming it down the throats of the other side.”\nAdams said the reform effort, which won support from a broad coalition of conservative groups, showed Desai’s ability to work across the aisle.",
    "In one of several cases Desai handled in late 2020 and early 2021, state GOP Chair Kelli Ward sought to have a court void the outcome of Arizona's presidential election — which Biden won by 10,457 votes — based on claims involving how officials count ballots that tabulation machines can't read.",
    "“Even when she’s an opponent, she’s fair.”\nAdams has frequently opposed measures Desai has championed, but he also worked with her on a failed 2020 ballot measure called the Second Chances, Rehabilitation and Public Safety Act, which failed to gather enough signatures for the ballot.",
    "“That gave the education community enough daylight to grow a lead that survived through November.”\nAfter months of legal challenges, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge struck down the measure March 11, stating it can't be enforced because of an Arizona Supreme Court ruling.",

    "Part of her work ethic can be attributed, she said, to her parent’s adherence to Jainism, a religion that believes in reincarnation, even though Desai said she does not practice that religion today.",
