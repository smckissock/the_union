    "(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, Pool)\nOAN Newsroom\nUPDATED 8:45 AM PT – Wednesday, April 6, 2022\nDemocrat candidate for Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs refused to give an answer about at what point in a pregnancy she would allow abortion to be banned.",
    "And that’s something that needs to be discussed in the medical exam room, not by politicians.”\nHobbs’s comments come on the heels of Republican Governor Doug Ducey signing into law a bill which bans abortions in the state after 15-weeks.",

    "She was pressed by the host again and she replied that it’s not up to her, just the woman and her doctor.",
    "“Where do you draw the line and say okay, abortions after this point in time, no, it’s a no go.",
    "MORE NEWS: Rep. Cawthorn Explains Basic Biology To Speaker Pelosi\nOriginal Article Oann",
