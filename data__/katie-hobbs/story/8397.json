    "Building on Wall Street Journal polling showing that Republicans are gaining support among both black and Hispanic voters, the six-figure campaign zoned in on Democratic Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly over his vote on the progressive abortion legislation (which the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has dubbed “the most radical abortion bill of all time”).",

    "“And I will work with the Legislature that’s in place to ensure that women have continued access to reproductive healthcare.”\nThe host pressed her again, asking, “But where do you draw the line though?",
    "“And that’s something that needs to be discussed in the medical exam room, not by politicians.”\nHobbs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Wire.",
    "I’ve been very clear on my position on that throughout my time in the Legislature.”\nWATCH:\n“So if I’m elected governor, that’s what folks are getting,” she continued.",
    "Where do you draw the line where you say, ‘OK abortions after this point of time, no, it’s a no go?’”\nHobbs did not name one limit that she would oppose on abortion.",
    "We believe in our country, in the value of truth and the freedom to speak it, and in the right to challenge tyranny wherever we see it.",
    "Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs would not name one limit she supports on abortion, even when given multiple opportunities.",
