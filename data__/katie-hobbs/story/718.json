    "pic.twitter.com/XVjjQFXDGL\n— Garret Lewis (@GarretLewis) February 22, 2022\nA Data Orbital Polling & Press poll conducted in February among likely voters found Lake beating Hobbs with 42.7 percent to 41.4 percent in the race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov.",
    "Lake, the Republican frontrunner, also led her primary challenger, former Rep. Matt Salmon, by 25 points with less than six months ahead of the state’s primary, which is a sign voters want a political outsider instead of a career politician.",
    "While Lake’s lead over Hobbs is relatively small and many voters are still undecided, this poll is evidence that voters want a political outsider, like Kari Lake, rather than a governor who is part of the establishment, like Doug Ducey.",
    "The people of Arizona evidently no longer want establishment career politicians to govern the state, and they are actively seeking political outsiders to shake things up in Phoenix.",
    "Republican Kari Lake, a former news anchor, is the only candidate who can defeat Democrat Katie Hobbs in Arizona’s gubernatorial race this November, a new poll found.",
    "“President Trump knows how to pick winners, and new polling proves the President was correct once again,” Lake wrote in a press release on Tuesday.",
    "“She’s fantastic, she loves the people, loves the state.”\nA victory for Kari Lake would signal the return of America First policies in Arizona.",
    "Trump also told RSBN’s Brian Glenn on RSBN’s “2021 Year in Review” special that he believes Lake will easily win the election.",
    "Lake has championed election integrity, a secure southern border, and tough-on-crime policies in the critical swing state.",
    "BREAKING NEWS: @KariLake is the only Republican in the race for Governor that beats Katie Hobbs in a head to head matchup.",
    "Trump endorsed Lake in September and recently stood with her on stage during his rally last month in Florence, Arizona.",
    "Lake also has the staunch backing of President Trump, another political outsider.",
    "I think she’s gonna win big,” Trump said.",
    "The RINO political class is going down.",
    "“She’s doing great in Arizona.",
    "Doug Ducey."
