    "PHOENIX (AP) — Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich and Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs both urged the state Supreme Court not to accept a petition filed by the Arizona Republican Party asking to strike down early voting laws used by 90% of voters.",
    "Lawyers for Hobbs defended the early voting laws, writing, “Arizona’s early voting system is secure, efficient, and complies with the Arizona Constitution.”\n----\nSTAY IN TOUCH WITH US ANYTIME, ANYWHERE",
    "Brnovich said the court has no jurisdiction to take on the question but did not take a position on the GOP’s argument that early voting is unconstitutional.",
