Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the “hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens coming into our country every year.”\nA woman who said she was a good friend of Vance’s family described him as the “real deal” and praised him for “working his way up.”\nAt least one person was at the event just to get a book signed.",

    "“When somebody is fleshed out and three-dimensional, and they have real people in their lives and family, that makes a difference.”\nThe few polls that have been released publicly show former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, Vance’s primary rival as a right-wing online agitator, with a steady lead.",

    "When Runge asked Vance about it, Vance answered that he recognizes the “biggest problem in this country is not just bad policies from government, but the unholy alliance between the government and our biggest corporations.”\nRunge said he likes Vance, but wasn’t entirely sold.",

    "But with the primary less than four months away, he still hasn’t popped in the polls — a sign that maybe Vance isn’t able to speak for the white working class on the political stage the way he did in his book.",
    "“We’re becoming the kind of place where kids like me don’t feel like they can dream big dreams anymore,” said Vance, dressed in a neat white button-down, blazer and jeans, with a child clinging to his leg.",
    "With big national name recognition from his book and its buzzed-about movie adaptation, Vance was expected to shake up the GOP field with star power and access to far-right activists and major donors.",
    "“When you look at your pay stub, and you see you’re paying the same Social Security as federal, and then at the end of the year they’re taking 30% of my check — that’s why I’m in debt,” she said.",
    "Other candidates clamoring for oxygen include state Sen. Matt Dolan, investor Mike Gibbons, luxury car dealer Bernie Moreno, IT executive Mark Pukita, and former state GOP chair Jane Timken.",
