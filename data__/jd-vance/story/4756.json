    "I do think, though, when we get to June, we're going to look back and say that most of the big endorsements he made, not the ones in deep red House districts, but the big endorsements he made are going to turn out to, you know, not have been right.\"",
    "You've got Republicans killing Republicans there, with the Club for Growth, who's been carrying Trump's water in Georgia, is now working against him with the J.D.",
    "And the idea — look, I’ve known him for a long time — the idea that he makes these decisions based upon political analysis is sophistry.",
    "He's gone after four incumbent Republican governors, Kemp in Georgia, Little in Ohio, DeWine in Ohio, Ivey in Alabama.",
    "I think all four of them are going to win their primaries over the course of the next six to eight weeks.",
    "This is all emotional decisions and who speaks to him last, and you saw that in the J.D.",
    "But I will tell you, let's look at the governor's races first.",
    "Vance — I think you saw it with the endorsement of Dr. Oz.",
    "EXCERPT:\nCHRISTIE: \"Well, we're going to find out.",
    "So, these are going to land all over the place.",
    "Vance one is anywhere near a layup.",
    "So, he’s kind of all over the lot.",
    "I don't know that the J.D.",
    "Vance endorsement."
