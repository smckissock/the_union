    "Under Federal law, he can be fired if he is found to have engaged in \"misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a direct reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function,” is or to be “less than successful [in his] executive performance.”\nIt’s true that Trump could have removed Fauci from his leadership role on the COVID-19 Task Force, but Fauci would still have been able to exercise enormous influence from his existing role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which he’s held since 1984.",
    "Rather than being able to fire executive branch employees who were hired during the Obama administration, Trump was forced to leave in place countless leakers, vandals, foot-draggers, and saboteurs — people like Alexander Vindman and Eric Ciaramella, whom the corrupt, complicit corporate media affectionately call “whistleblowers.” As it turns out, these two executive branch employees were instrumental in getting Trump impeached.",

    "The Deep State must and will be brought to heel.”\nThink about it: Shouldn’t a chief executive be able to hire and fire staff as he pleases — especially a sitting U.S. president, whose job it is to carry out the agenda that got him elected?",
    "Senior agency officials report that poor performance by career employees in policy-relevant positions has resulted in long delays and substandard-quality work for important agency projects, such as drafting and issuing regulations.",
    "to Republican presidents, what do we have to lose by enabling a president to fire hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats?”\nOn October 21, 2020, President Trump issued an executive order meant to address this issue.",

    "An example of this might be when he starts talking less about what a terrible job the incumbent is doing and more about what he himself would do if elected to office.",
    "As Adam Andrzejewski of OpenTheBooks.com reports for Forbes: “President Trump was holding the headcount of the executive agencies roughly flat through at least 2018.",
    "One of the surest signs that a fence-sitter has decided to run for office is a shift in the content of his speeches from the general to the specific.",
    "Then, the pandemic driven spending caused a massive federal hiring spree in FY2020.”\nIncidentally, a government job is great work if you can get it.",
    "Or take the man who during the past two years has had more influence on our lives than any other member of the federal government: Anthony Fauci.",
    "And if a U.S. president is to be held accountable for the job he does in office, he should be able to make his own hiring and firing decisions.",
    "High performance by such employees can meaningfully enhance agency operations, while poor performance can significantly hinder them.",
    "Which staff member is more likely to help a president enact his agenda — one who voted for him, or one who voted for the other guy?",
    "The answer is obvious, but doing so isn’t easy, and this “Deep State” problem thus hampered much of Trump’s term in office.",
    "Indeed, the Beltway Swamp, which Trump vowed to drain, actually grew in size and stature during his term in office.",
