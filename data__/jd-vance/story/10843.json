Rick Scott (R-Fla.) had just pitched his far-reaching “Rescue Plan” to the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying that the Republicans who'd worried about it — nervous about the politics of an income tax that would hit the very poor — were out of touch with real voters and the harm being done to them.",

    "And while Trump has remained more focused on overturning the 2020 election than on the party's policy agenda, that focus, shared by most Republicans, has convinced most in the party that it will win the next election without moderating any of its positions, or its rhetoric about domestic enemies who want to stab America in the back.",
    "“Before hundreds of innocent Ukrainians had lost their lives, a horrific decision had been made,” a narrator says, asserting that the decision to scrap the pipeline would end up “helping Russia fund their invasion.” (The pipeline was not due to be completed until 2023; Biden issued a ban on Russian oil imports on Tuesday.)",
    "“Would you compare Vladimir Putin's actions against Ukraine to Adolf Hitler's actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia before the outbreak of World War II?” (Quinnipiac, 1374 adults)\nQuinnipiac has asked a number of questions to find out how Americans are processing the fast-changing news from Ukraine.",
    "This spot, for his U.S. Senate campaign, returns to the theme, with a quick introduction from Amy Kissinger, a trustee of the Ohio School Boards Association, who calls politics a “crooked cesspool” so Mandel, who served in various elected roles from 2007 to 2019, can explain how he tried to change it.",

    "The cancellation of a pipeline that was not scheduled to be completed until 2023 was “endangering America's security, and helping Russia fund their invasion.”\nThe energy angle was a no-brainer for Republicans — the party is unified in favor of deregulation, drilling, fracking and coal.",
    "“Do you approve or disapprove of how President Biden is handling the situation with Russia and Ukraine?” (NPR/Marist, 1322 adults)\nLike last week's Quinnipiac polling, the latest from Marist finds a big spike in support for how the president is handling Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
