    "not liking Trump six years ago as some sort of breaking news, when they’ve already covered it to death since this race began,” Wiggins wrote.",
    "and concluded that he is the strongest America First conservative in the race.”\nVance’s initial distaste for Trump is well-established.",
    "Like Vance, Rep. Josh McLaurin, D-Sandy Springs, went to Yale for law school, and the two lived together for a time.",
    "Trump’s endorsement letter even brings up the “not so great things” Vance said about him in the past.",
    "“And in particular, I think about that with NAFTA,” he described to a crowd in New Albany last month.",

    "“Clearly, President Trump trusts that J.D.",
    "“It’s laughable that the media treats J.D.",
    "The “America’s Hitler” bit is at the end.",
