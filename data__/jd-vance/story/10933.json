    "Kelly announced the move in a Twitter video, in which she described the entire gerrymander as racist: “This is what racism looks like when it's not stepping on George Floyd's neck.”\nA Republican candidate for Colorado secretary of state turned herself in to authorities Wednesday, after a grand jury indicted Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters on 10 counts related to her alleged effort to copy voting machine hard drives to prove that the 2020 election was stolen.",
    "I give folks a little latitude right now to deal with the prices that are hitting working families' bottom line, but it's not an excuse to do something like more pipeline approvals or expanded drilling in the Arctic.”\nInstead, said Raad, the climate left and Democrats needed to treat the crisis as a reason to meet renewable energy commitments — which had been part of the conversation during other oil shocks, such as in the 1970s.",
    "This one stars the owner of a small botanicals business in Augusta, Ga., who says it's gotten hard to live a good middle-class life, that she's worried about rising costs and that Joe Biden is “making progress.” The only data in the ad is the latest number of jobs created since Biden took office, 6.6 million, which Democratic pollsters worry is getting lost in day-to-day coverage and muted by inaccurate monthly jobs reports.",
    "“My opinion is that whoever represents the district should really make a strong effort to represent the whole district and not have it be kind of a winner take all.”\nEttinger had donated to the National Republican Senatorial Committee before entering the race; the first Democrat to announce for the May 24 primary was Richard Painter, a Republican-turned-Democrat who ran for U.S. Senate in 2018.",
    "“The DPA — which you have already used to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and respond to wildfires — provides you with the historic opportunity to produce alternatives to fossil fuels, fight the climate emergency, combat Putin’s stranglehold on the world’s energy economy, and support the transition to a renewable and just economy,” the climate groups, around 200 of them, wrote in the letter.",
    "A few sheriffs who've endorsed Dolan stand in front of the camera and thank him for giving law enforcement everything it asked for in Columbus: “Funding, training, equipment, you name it.”\nSarah for Governor, “No.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders already wiped out her competition ahead of the GOP's May 24 gubernatorial primary, but some of the $13 million she's raised is showing up on TV.",
    "His support has remained flat, not fading, and Gibbons's lead comes from a 5-point advantage with voters who identify as “very conservative.” No candidate has a lead even that large with another demographic; Vance, who's run the most anti-elite, populist campaign, does slightly better with White voters who have a college degree than with White voters who don't.",
    "“As Putin's brutal war in the Ukraine has led to such high energy prices, we know we need to move forward and accelerate,” said White House national climate adviser Gina McCarthy on a Wednesday night call with the Climate Power Education Fund, a campaign group created by environmental groups — including Sunrise and the Sierra Club — during the 2020 election.",
    "In the new 5th Congressional District, Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), a leader of the Blue Dog Democrats who had argued for voting on the bipartisan infrastructure package separately from the Build Back Better budget, got just one challenger — Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who’s making her third run for office, and her first for a seat designed to elect a Democrat.",
    "Our country is facing a crisis of democracy, as extreme elected officials and insiders continue to pump out misinformation to tip the scales of American democracy in their favor.”\n“Mayor Pete” got plenty of attention when it was released last year, both as a documentary and as a way for Pete Buttigieg's political enemies to vent about him.",
    "The Pat McCrory Committee, “Stand With Me.” This is one of the first 2022 campaign ads focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the angle is that Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), the Trump-endorsed Republican running for North Carolina's open U.S. Senate seat, once praised the strategic mind-set of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

Matt Dolan (R), who's rejected the Trump-centric strategy of other Republicans running for U.S. Senate, keeps messaging on his legislative experience; he's the only candidate in the race who has any.",
    "“She was saying that there are ample opportunities for drilling out there, and that is clearly not the long-term solution.”\nWhen the Article III Project launched in 2019, Republicans controlled the White House and the Senate, and were trying to confirm as many judges as possible before an election intervened.",
    "“The more we put out renewables, the less dependent on fossil fuels we are, and the more secure we are.”\nEven as a candidate, Biden was wary of some of the climate promises other Democrats made, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pledging to transition to 100 percent “renewable and sustainable” energy by 2030.",
    "“While we call for the use of the DPA, we implore that you use this mechanism for peaceful means, not increased militarization of the conflict.”\nThe Biden administration had not responded to that request as of Thursday, but the climate left, adjusting to the new political reality, wasn't being ignored.",
    "Lindsay wasn't talking specifically about any sexual orientation, but the idea that teaching children about sex is a way for predators to take advantage of them has been around for a long time, and bubbled up all last year in other fights over what could be displayed in classrooms and school libraries.",
    "Some on the climate left saw an opportunity in the fossil fuel industry's rhetoric, and the speed at which the industry reacted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by saying it was ready to drill more, like the American Petroleum Institute's statement on the “critical role” the industry was ready to play.",
    "“Talking to young people, there's a lot of fear about our inability to pass climate policy at the federal level.”\nThe Biden administration's response to the Russia invasion of Ukraine, including appeals for domestic and foreign energy providers to crank up production, has frustrated the climate left.",
    "Peters was indicted on a charge of alleged conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and attempting to influence a public servant — all related to how she obtained information from Dominion machines and brought it to an August 2021 voter fraud symposium organized by MyPillow founder Mike Lindell.",
    "“We couldn't just shut it all off tomorrow, and we're realizing that more than ever.” Polling for climate groups, said Deiseroth, was revealing that “the language of ‘moratoriums' and ‘stop drilling'” alienated voters, while “transition away from fossil fuels over a longer period of time” did not.",
    "Davis has kept his gloves off, with an ad campaign portraying Democrats as hypocrites over their embrace of Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court nomination, and with condemnations of state courts which, he says, have acted unconstitutionally by throwing out Republican-drawn congressional maps.",
    "It's really stupid for Democrats to go down this path: If it’s fair game to go after Republican attorneys for representing 2020 challengers, it’s fair game to question Judge Jackson for going out of her way to provide free legal services to Gitmo terrorists while she was in private practice.",
    "Some would call that grooming.”\nGrooming, a term typically used to describe sexual predators taking advantage of young people, has entered the Republican lexicon as a way to describe something else: people, especially teachers, who teach children about gender identity and sexual preferences.",
    "“It’s important to recognize that an election administrator who compromises her own voting equipment, who's under criminal indictment, and who was on stage clapping as election deniers called for me to be hung, days before announcing her candidacy, is unfit for office,” Griswold said.",
    "Here, she sums up her agenda as “good schools, lower taxes and higher-paying jobs” and saying “no to Biden and the radical left's agenda.” The gimmick, that Huckabee “had to say no, a lot” as a White House press secretary, is paid off when she tells her kids to shut off CNN.",
    "In November, anti-leftist commentator James Lindsay used the term “Groomer Schools” on his New Discourses podcast, warning against the “sexualization of children through critical theories of identity,” and linking it to Marxism's critique of the traditional family structure.",
    "“Everyone deserves a fair shot at success,” says Moore, “no matter where their story begins.”\nRon Johnson for Senate, “Joseph Project.” In his first 2022 ads, Wisconsin's Republican senator talked more about what he was trying to stop in Washington than what he was doing.",
    "Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said that even Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm's appeals to energy companies, which Republicans saw as told-you-so moments, didn't back away from the climate agenda.",
    "Only a few of the candidates in the Democratic and Republican primaries for governor have built competitive campaigns; many more took advantage of the low filing requirements to get on the ballot, including at least one life coach who ran for president six years ago.",
    "Activists who'd rallied for a Green New Deal are adjusting and retooling their messaging for a new moment — one where the Biden administration hasn't delivered on many of its climate pledges, and where environmentalists are being blamed for higher gas prices anyway.",
    "As demand for gas returned to pre-pandemic levels, the price went up; that meant setbacks for the climate left, including increased approval of drilling on public lands and a pressure campaign by the Biden administration to get OPEC nations to ramp up production.",
    "It would have been unthinkable, back when Democratic candidates were being heckled by climate protesters for not rejecting fossil fuel money, for Democratic Party leaders to urge energy companies to use the leases they had already and drill for more oil.",
    "Serious crimes.”\nColorado Republicans condemned Peters and called on her to quit the race; two other Republicans, including a former clerk from Jefferson County, are also running for the right to challenge first-term Secretary of State Jena Griswold (D).",
    "But, look: If I were the Ohio Supreme Court, and I just saw these votes lined up with where [Chief Justice John G.] Roberts was, I would say, oh well, there are at least five votes to reverse this at the U.S. Supreme Court, so maybe we shouldn’t do this.",
    "MD: The Democrats are talking about picking the first Black woman for the Supreme Court, so I'm going to point out the hypocrisy — they actually filibustered who the woman should have been the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, Janice Rogers Brown.",
    "Ron DeSantis (R), pushed back on activists who referred to the state's new restriction on sex education for public school students below grade four as the “don't say gay bill” by suggesting that it would be better referred to as an “anti-grooming” bill.",

    "That Republican justice in Ohio needs to understand that if she sides with [Democratic elections lawyer] Marc Elias and [former attorney general] Eric Holder, the Democratic operatives in this case, she’s going to get reversed by the Supreme Court.",

    "“I don't compliment our enemies.” The Club for Growth, which backs Budd, has run ads accusing McCrory of being too critical of Trump; this spot ignores Trump entirely but drags Budd for voicing the same opinions on Russia as the former president.",

    "Samuels had supported another Omar challenger in 2020, and opposed a 2021 ballot measure that would have replaced the city’s police department and removed city charter language setting a requirement for how many officers the city employs.",
    "“That's why we have to keep pushing for congressional action so that we can do whatever it takes to get the president's climate agenda over the finish line.”\nThe climate left could be patient, while it put pressure on Biden and Manchin.",
    "The project was a success, but Democrats got back the Senate 14 months ago — and before that, they'd won a number of crucial state court races that would end up saving seats for their party in post-census congressional redistricting.",
    "Out of all the people in this country who need free legal services, including Black families in Washington, D.C., in her own backyard, why does she think it was so important to provide her limited time and resources here?",
