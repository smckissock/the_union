    "David Perdue, Ted Budd, Janice McGeachin — all have bombed or are bombing at the polls with their respective races.",
    "He also singles out Fox News host Tucker Carlson and novelist-turned-Trumpist political aspirant J.D.",
    "And now comes one of his fiercest Republican critic to kick him while he’s down.",
    "His Twitter clone may wind up being yet another of his many failed ventures.",
