    "\"I need to say something that I get attacked by the media for saying this, I get attacked by my opponents for saying this, but I believe it very strongly and so I want to say it up here: I believe the election was stolen from Donald J. Trump,\" Josh Mandel, the Republican front-runner in the Ohio Senate race, said at a debate last year.",
    "Which brings me to an interview CNN's Manu Raju and Alex Rogers conducted with McConnell, the Senate minority leader, about Republican prospects in the 2022 midterms -- and, in particular, former President Donald Trump's ongoing insistence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.",

    "Rep. Ted Budd, the Trump-endorsed candidate in the North Carolina Senate race, voted against certifying the Electoral College results on January 6, 2021.",
    "Rep. Billy Long, who is running in that same Missouri GOP primary, recently released a new ad in which he says this: \"Democrats rigged the election.",
    "In that same race, wealthy businessman Bernie Moreno ran an ad in which he says: \"President Trump says the election was stolen, and he's right.\"",
    "Lots of Republican Senate candidates are willingly accepting Trump's Big Lie about the 2020 election as a way to curry favor with the GOP base.",
    "There is simply no evidence -- at the state or national level -- that suggests that the results of the 2020 election were fraudulent.",
    "Now we have Biden and the far-left crazies letting inflation rise faster than an auctioneer rattling off numbers,\" Long says.",
    "\"I'm running for Senate to stop the insanity, stop the wokeness, and stop the Democrats from stealing another election.\"",
    "Elections are usually decided by a candidate's vision for what comes next, not by dwelling on what has already happened.",
    "And McConnell is right that focusing on the idea of a stolen past election is the surest way to lose a future election.",
    "But you get the idea: Supporting the Big Lie has become a sort of litmus test within the Republican Party.",
    "\"We need to have audits across the country because we must get election integrity back,\" Greitens said.",
