    "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Longtime frontrunner Josh Mandel still leads the crowded Republican primary field for Ohio’s open U.S. Senate seat, but the latest independent poll also shows the race is tightening — and many voters are still undecided — less than three months from the May 3 election.",
    "Trafalgar is considered to be conservative-leaning, but the Atlanta-based pollster has a track record of accurate polls with low margins of error since the political rise of former President Donald Trump.",
    "Trafalgar also correctly predicted Trump winning the presidency in 2016, and FiveThirtyEight rated it the second most accurate pollster for the 2020 election despite it predicting a Biden loss.",
    "This six-point swing, then, could theoretically put Gibbons in front of Mandel since three more points for Gibbons and three fewer points for Mandel would overcome Mandel’s 4.6-point lead.",
    "The pollster does not explain its methods in great detail, however, but it notes on its website that it uses a mix of techniques like live calls, texts and emails to conduct polls.",
    "Mandel, Vance and Timken have lost less than a percentage point each since December, while the biggest change has been in undecided voters, which have dropped by nearly 1 in 10.",
    "Dolan’s bump in the polls may be influenced by two ad buys since January, worth $1.7 million and $2 million, according to The (Toledo) Blade and Fox News, respectively.",
    "Mandel, the former Ohio treasurer and 2012 GOP Senate nominee, leads the pack with 21% of the vote, according to a poll conducted Feb. 8-10 by the Trafalgar Group.",
    "The pollster correctly predicted Trump would win Ohio last year, as a poll days before the election favored him over President Joe Biden by 4.8 percentage points.",
    "The February poll’s margin of error is 2.98 percentage points, meaning a candidate could theoretically lose or gain about 3% if the survey were done again.",
    "Its surveys are also shorter and try to accommodate for a recent trend of respondents intentionally giving false answers because of who is asking and why.",
    "Gibbons, recognizable from a football-themed TV ad blitz, and Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians, have made the biggest jumps in two months.",
    "Former Ohio GOP chair Jane Timken is the only named candidate with a single-digit result (9.8%), and other candidates mustered 3.3% total.",
    "Tightening race since last poll\nMandel’s lead has shrunk since Trafalgar’s first poll in December, as fewer people have become undecided.",
    "Vance (14.3%) and Chagrin Falls state Senator Matt Dolan (10.2%) round out the top four.",
    "Cleveland banker Mike Gibbons (16.4%), Cincinnati author and venture capitalist J.D.",
    "However, 25% of the 1,085 likely voters surveyed are still undecided.",
    "The poll-tracking website gives Trafalgar an overall A- rating.",
    "Cleveland auto dealer Bernie Moreno has since left the race.",
    "And that poll’s margin of error was just 2.96 points.",
    "Trump won the state by just over 8 points.",
    "How reliable is the Trafalgar Group?"
