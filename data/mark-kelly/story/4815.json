    "We’ll leave out the easy-GOP states like Alabama and focus on the highlights:\nAlaska: 32/62\nArizona: 34/58\nColorado: 39/51\nFlorida: 37/55\nGeorgia: 33/56\nIowa: 32/58\nMissouri: 29/63\nNevada: 32/60\nNew Hampshire: 41/51\nNorth Carolina: 35/56\nOhio: 31/60\nPennsylvania: 36/55\nWisconsin: 38/55\nBiden can’t even get to 40% in these states, with the single exception of New Hampshire.",
    "Acutely aware of the need to get distance from the president, the four most endangered Democratic incumbents — Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan — are increasingly taking steps to highlight their independence from the president and underscore their differences.",
    "His tanking approval ratings hit right where it hurts — in states where Senate Democrats’ hopes of holding onto the majority rest:\nBiden’s drag on swing-state incumbents is emerging as a pivotal factor in the midterm Senate elections, where the loss of just one Democratic-held seat in November could put Republicans in control.",
    "If Biden’s approval ratings were relatively close, then it might not matter as much, but his deep unpopularity combined with Democrats’ hard lurch to the Left will likely dismay independents enough to turn out to force a correction — and Democratic incumbents and open-seat candidates will pay the price for it.",
    "Probably not much when voters make distinctions between cheap talk and real action:\nOn social media, where they shy away from praise of the president and instead focus on their efforts to prod the White House to action, it’s hard to tell they’ve voted in line with Biden no less than 96 percent of the time.",
    "Note that there is more volatility in the disapproval number than in the approval number, with voters apparently vacillating on just how much they disapprove of Biden but not much at all on whether they approve of the job he’s doing.",
    "However, Biden’s job approval ratings are soooo bad that Democrats will likely see no benefit at all from those openings, which they had initially hoped to use to expand their control of the upper chamber.",
    "Their public pushback against Biden’s plan to lift the Trump-era border restriction known as Title 42 is the most visible expression of the effort to get distance from the president.",
    "And today’s chart on Biden’s job approval from RCP shows why:\nVoter confidence in Biden collapsed after he abandoned Americans in Afghanistan, and has never recovered.",
    "In fact, he’s only got a favorable job approval in four states at the moment, and only two of those with majorities: Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Vermont.",
    "The latest Civiqs poll, which breaks out approval ratings by states, shows just how bad it looks for Democrats in the states up for Senate elections this cycle.",
    "A month before a Trump-appointed judge struck down Biden’s mask mandate on mass transit, three of the four voted in favor of a Republican bill to do just that.",
    "Biden’s basically flatlining at 40% average aggregate approval, and nothing in the past eight months suggests a heartbeat in this presidency going forward.",
    "That’s perhaps even more acute in Senate races, where the upper chamber operates more explicitly as a check on presidential power.",
    "The efforts now being made by these endangered incumbents show that they have little confidence in Biden to improve them, however.",
    "Even though the name “Joe Biden” won’t appear on any of these ballots, Biden himself is the central issue in these elections.",
    "Voters understand that Senate candidates don’t just represent themselves but also their party’s agenda, and the president.",
    "Normally that would have a balancing impact, especially in a cycle with five Republican retirements from the Senate.",
    "We’re still about five months out from early voting, so there’s arguably some room for Biden’s numbers to improve.",
    "Politico might be a little late to the track meet when it comes to Democrats’ running away from Joe Biden.",
    "But the four Democrats are also finding other ways of signaling to voters.",
    "That would also apply in other Senate races too, of course.",
    "They’ve visited the border wall and blocked his nominees.",
    "That’s the problem for these vulnerable incumbents.",
    "He’s toast, and so are all Biden’s allies.",
    "How well will that work out?",
    "Officially begun, perhaps."
