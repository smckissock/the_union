    "+11\nView gallery\nScott Kelly is one of the most important astronauts to come out of NASA, having spent a year in space\n+11\nView gallery\nBy this point Rogozin had already made a number of controversial posts on Twitter, including calling President Joe Biden's sanctions against Russia's space and aerospace industry were 'Alzheimer sanctions'\nThe station is scheduled to come to an end of its life in 2031, when it will be safely deorbited, and put down in the south pacific ocean.",
    "Rogozin wrote: 'The termination of cooperation with the Russian Federation in the field of higher education, scientific research and professional training announced by the leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany, of course, causes irreparable damage to the established long-term cooperation ties and significantly slows down activities in the field of outer space exploration for peaceful purposes.'",
    "Shortly after the invasion, Rogozin suggested that if Russia withdrew from the ISS, it could come down on the US or Europe - but NASA has since confirmed it is exploring contingencies, including using SpaceX and Northrup Grumman spacecraft to take over the duty of 'station keeping' and stopping it leaving orbit.",

    "It is split into two halves, the American half is primarily responsible for power and life support, whereas the Russian half keeps it in orbit, and stops it making an uncontrolled re-entry, where it could crash on land, instead of the ocean.",
    "He'd largely ignored Rogozin, until the space agency boss, with whom Kelly would have been familiar as he had travelled to the ISS on Russian rockets in the past, tweeted pictures of the American flag being removed from a Soyuz rocket.",
    "He was referring to NASA purchasing seats on Soyuz rockets, at about $90 million per trip, when the Space Shuttle program was shut down after the Columbia and Challenger disasters, that saw both craft explode, with crew on board.",

    "The prospect of a longer stay will be daunting for Vande Hei, who will have been on the station for 355 consecutive days by March 30, beating the US record held by Scott Kelly, who was on board for 340 days.",
    "By this point Rogozin had already made a number of controversial posts on Twitter, including calling President Joe Biden's sanctions against Russia's space and aerospace industry were 'Alzheimer sanctions'.",
