    "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) back the idea; an early draft of President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address slated for Tuesday night included support for the effort, but may be taken out to include other priorities.",
    "No one bill that has been introduced so far adopts all of those principles; of those requirements, Sen. Josh Hawley’s (R-Missouri) bill only has a clear enforcement mechanism, according to CREW, requiring members to give gains from banned stock trades to the Treasury Department.",
    "But the bill would only require that those stocks be put into a blind trust when members take office, meaning that lawmakers can still influence their stock portfolios in a blind trust with legislation that could affect companies that they had previously invested in.",
    "According to Insider, which spoke to two anonymous sources, the committee has requested testimony from government watchdog groups like the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).",
    "In guidelines circulated to Congress, CREW says that stock trading bans must not allow members to put their portfolios in a blind trust, must ban spouses and dependent children from trading stock and must have a strict enforcement mechanism.",
    "One of the strictest proposals was introduced in February by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Steve Daines (R-Montana) and Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) and Matt Rosendale (R-Montana).",
    "The bipartisan, bicameral legislation would outright ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning stocks, requiring them to divest from all stocks other than widely held investment funds while in office.",
    "The Committee on House Administration will soon hold a hearing on proposals to ban members of Congress from being able to trade individual stocks, taking a step toward eventually voting on such legislation.",
    "Ossoff and Kelly introduced a bill in January that would ban more family members from owning stocks; it would also ban spouses and dependent children from actively trading stocks.",
    "Bans also shouldn’t allow for intent loopholes, CREW says – in other words, there shouldn’t be a carveout for the lawmakers who supposedly unknowingly violated the law.",
    "The committee didn’t confirm the hearing with Insider, saying that hearings aren’t typically announced until a week before they’re held.",
    "This goes slightly further than other proposals, like one from Senators Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia) and Mark Kelly (D-Arizona).",
    "Lawmakers and their aides regularly violate the STOCK Act, which places disclosure requirements on members’ stock trades.",
    "However, recent bills have had rare bipartisan support, and some Senate Republicans are in favor of such proposals.",
    "According to financial filings, members will often report multimillion dollar trades months late.",
    "Lawmakers in the House and the Senate have introduced several different stock trading bans.",
    "Government watchdogs say that a stock trading ban must be strict in order to be effective.",
    "A committee hearing would be a big step to move the proposal forward within the House.",
    "Lawmakers have also invited the Congressional Research Service to testify.",
    "It’s unclear if a stock trading ban would pass if it came to a vote now.",
    "But violators typically only face a small fine of around $200.",
    "Republicans have not yet chosen a witness for the hearing.",
    "We only have 2 days left to raise $22,000 for Truthout.",
    "Every penny goes directly toward our publishing costs.",
    "As lawmakers have shown, however, enforcement is key.",
    "Violations would carry a $50,000 fine per infraction.",
    "Will you take a few seconds to help?",
    "Time is running out.",
