    "Veena Dubal, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law who studies the gig economy, called Weil a “pre-eminent economist and leader in the world of wage and hour law,” and said the denial of his nomination “makes no sense, except that particular industrial interests don’t want those laws enforced.”\nSee: From treatment of gig workers to tip transparency, the app-based economy could see key changes in 2022\nBoth Gould and Dubal said the gig economy’s worker-classification issue will likely continue to be fought in the courts and at the state level.",
    "We’ll continue to evaluate this nomination and how we move forward, but remain proud of the Administration’s pro-worker policies and work being done.”\nThe rejection of Weil’s nomination also likely means the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, known as the PRO Act — which the U.S. House of Representatives passed last year and would make it harder for gig companies to classify their workers as independent contractors, among other things — will not have enough votes in the Senate this session.",

    "Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, both of Arizona, and Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, on Wednesday night voted with Senate Republicans against moving forward on the nomination of David Weil, who headed the Wage and Hour Division under President Barack Obama.",
    "“David Weil is a qualified nominee for the Department of Labor, and we’re disappointed he didn’t get the votes on the floor of the Senate last night,” said Chris Meagher, a deputy press secretary for the White House.",
    "“It’s a shot across the bow for the PRO Act, which had little chance in any event,” said William Gould, professor emeritus at Stanford Law School and a former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board.",
    "Davidson, said the rejection of Weil’s nomination could mean the next head of the Wage and Hour Division will have a more “moderate stance” on worker classification.",
