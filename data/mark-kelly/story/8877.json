    "This one is going to be with us for a long time,”\n“This is serious stuff, this is a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and so yeah, I’m going to beat Mark Kelly in November,” Masters vowed, “he won’t be a senator by this time next year, but this vote, this disastrous vote will be his legacy.”\n“To put a pedophile apologist on the Supreme Court, it makes my blood boil,” he added as the discussion turned to Kelly’s recent remarks opposing Biden’s intent to end Title 42, the emergency health order to mitigate the spread of COVID by allowing the quick expulsion of illegal aliens.",
    "“Not well, you know, and it’s my job to make sure that everybody knows about it, right,” Masters said, “because Mark Kelly is one of these slimy Democrats who pretends to be moderate, right, at least Bernie Sanders basically says he’s a communist and so you can understand where he’s coming from, right, he tells you what kind of enemy he is.”\n“Mark Kelly, he votes the same way, he’s putting this pedophile apologist on the Supreme Court but then he pretends to be moderate…” he said.",
    "SIGN UP HERE\nNow that the SCOTUS confirmation of President Joe Biden’s nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson is pretty much a done deal, those who will vote for her ascendance to the nation’s highest court may very well bear the stain from their support for a judge with a history of being soft on crime, especially when it comes to internet pedophiles.",
    "While the D.C. Appeals Court judge’s tendency to mete out lenient sentences to perverts trafficking in child pornography drew much scrutiny online, it wasn’t enough to persuade Democrats as well as a number of Republicans who are poised to put her on the bench for the next several decades that she is an unacceptable candidate.",
    "No, when I explain to the voters in Arizona what Mark Kelly’s up to, right, the difference between his hard-left voting record and his cliche-ridden, pretending to be moderate, it’s disgusting, I think he’s a liar.”\nWith every Democrat on board along with the usual leftist enablers Sens.",
    "“You know, he’s taken a lot of bad votes, he’ll do whatever Chuck Schumer tells him to right?”\n(Video: Rumble)\n“This guy is a rubber stamp for the Biden open borders, inflation agenda,” he said, “but of all the bad votes Mark Kelly has taken I think this is the worst, right?",
    "During an appearance with host Steve Bannon on the “War Room” podcast, Masters shredded Kelly over his support for a woman who he called a “pedophile apologist,” giving voice to an opinion that is likely held by many conservative American voters.",
    "One Democrat who is supporting Jackson and taking heavy fire from his opponent in the upcoming contest for one of Arizona’s two Senate seats is Sen. Mark Kelly, the former astronaut who is up for reelection in November.",
    "Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the “pedophile apologist” will soon assume her seat on the Supreme Court where her activism will influence the direction of the country for a long time to come.",
    "“Blake, Mark Kelly’s gonna vote to confirm her, is that a vote that will end his political career in the great state of Arizona sir?” Bannon asked the candidate.",
    "“They think that pedophilia should be normalized, they think it’s OK, they think our laws come down too hard on these people.",
    "Bannon then asked how hard-working Hispanic Arizona voters would be reacting to Kelly’s vote for KBJ.",
    "And Republican Blake Masters didn’t hold back in expressing his disgust for his political adversary.",
