    "And one of my concerns is, we keep talking on your show here about escalation, because, as bad as everything is here, any kind of a mistake, an accident or an intentional, either one, that crosses into NATO territory has the danger of triggering Article 5 and potentially expanding this into a Russia-NATO war, which could have catastrophic ramifications.",
    "However, we do know that Jake Sullivan was in Rome today meeting with the Chinese to really lay out the stakes here for them and to explain that, if they were to make some sort of a decision where they side with Russia, instead of the rest of the world that is condemning this behavior, this invasion of Ukraine, there will be severe consequences.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): So what I propose we do is if, in fact, the Chinese are helping arm Russia and providing assistance to get around international sanctions, that we put secondary sanctions on China, that we go after anybody and everybody who tries to prop up the war criminal Putin.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nGRIFFIN: Despite Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that Russia's military operation is -- quote -- \"on time and going a planned,\" Russian troops are facing fierce resistance from Ukrainian residents as they begin trying to occupy two Ukrainian cities in the south.",

    "We do have one very sad update from that southern city of Mariupol, where a mother that the world saw being carried out of a maternity hospital on a stretcher just a few days ago, unfortunately, passed away from her injuries, that according to the Associated Press.",
    "You can see in this video this morning one of those Russian shells hit an apartment building, killing at least two people and injuring nearly a dozen others, the destruction quite widespread as firefighters rushed into the building trying to look for survivors.",
    "Do you think they look at that and say, that's one thing we don't want, that's one thing, whether we're being overt about the aid and the help, buying Russian oil after sanctions kick in, but certainly nothing so overt to trigger the same response?",
    "In the southern city of Mariupol, this drone video showing the pure devastation that Russian forces are inflicting on the civilian population there, indiscriminate firing on civilian areas and this Black smoke rising up across the horizon.",
    "James, if you think of China, and how much its economy and strength, even its military prowess has been built on the financial deals it has had with all these Western nations, whether it likes them or not, that's their bread and butter.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: If China were to decide to be an economic provider or to take additional steps there to Russia, they only make up 15 percent or 20 -- 15 to 20 percent of the world's economy.",
    "But it gives you a sense of the civilians that are caught amid this war just trying to search for safety and get out of the country if they can, and the Russians continuing their bombardment tonight, targeting this capital city Neil.",
    "Do you get a gut sense that it's moving in that direction, that the alarm and the testing, whatever you want to call it, is such that it's ratcheting up the likelihood of something even accidentally triggering something far wider?",
    "And there was also a letter that came out this weekend from the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus, which is comprised of 58 members, including 29 Democrats, saying that this is something we need to be paying attention to.",
    "But, still, there is only one choice for the West to understand and to take action, whether we fight on Ukraine as the battleground or battle will come farther to the West, and it will be Poland, Hungary or Baltic states next.",
    "But there are some signs that is not quite the case, and the message we have for China, if it entertains doing just that, and all of this as President Zelenskyy is prepared to address Congress, albeit virtually, on Wednesday.",
    "He's hit, what, close to two dozen hospitals, medical centers, taken out scores of civilians, and that that will be his strategy going forward, even at great risk, when he comes within just a few miles of the Polish border.",
    "So, certainly, the outrage over that attack has put another spin on all of this, but many of the people I have spoken here getting out of Ukraine, they told me they don't think this situation is going to end anytime soon.",
    "Still, the mayor of Lviv -- he strikes were so close to here -- the mayor of Lviv repeated a mantra that we have heard now from Ukrainian officials over time and again, that they want to see a no-fly zone over Ukraine.",
    "Why would they risk compromising that, seeing the same kind of sanctions that Russia has, to join this fight, and a fight, we're told, that they really kind of wince at and the performance of Vladimir Putin in general?",
    "And, on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018 to address this, and we're told it will be the start of a process that will go right through the end of the year.",
    "What we know from the U.S. now is that the anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles that have been so effective for the Ukrainians, resupply of those weapons was not present at the base at the time of strikes -- Neil.",
    "MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Neil, with four airstrikes in four days in the Western part of the country, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby says it's clear that Russia is expanding its targets in the West.",
    "CAVUTO: So, Minister, obviously, the more we see Russia drag this out, or that it can't close the deal because of the bravery and the tenacity of your fellow Ukrainians, the more desperate he presumably becomes.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nHEINRICH: There are growing calls from Capitol Hill to take this very seriously and to impose secondary sanctions on China if they are found to be evade -- helping Russia evade the sanctions.",
    "But as bad as it sounds, we cannot risk expanding the war into Poland or into Slovakia or into the Baltics, and now that, all of a sudden, it's not just Ukraine who's suffering, but the West who's suffering.",
    "So, we're hearing calls from Congress to do more, and, so far, nothing being embraced at the moment from the White House, but they are signaling that they're certainly taking this seriously, Neil.",
    "But we simply cannot allow this to expand beyond the border, so that our own people come under fire, that our own people could, God forbid, have the possibility of a tactical nuclear weapon used.",
    "And this is an effort to not only conquer Ukraine and be that first step in Putin's delusional dream, but also is intended to intimidate the countries of Eastern Europe, which are a part of NATO.",
    "And this at the same time, last week, he was taking some troops out of the Mideast to join what he called the good fight in Ukraine, a worldwide call for patriots to come and fight for the cause.",
    "And with inflation at a 40-year high at 7.9 percent, Americans are struggling to keep up everywhere, a big challenge that pay -- a big challenge is that pay has not kept up with that inflation.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJOHN KIRBY, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: We're going to continue to get as much security assistance to the Ukrainians as fast as we can and in the most efficient, effective way.",
    "That's why it's significant that those Russian cruise missiles, the planes that fired those cruise missiles were in Russian airspace that fired on that base in Western Ukraine over the weekend.",
    "And every time we let them decide what to do, and then we react to that, this -- you're violating the first rule of warfare, which is make your enemy respond to you, not the other way around.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nTOBIN: Now, a U.S. senior defense officials says, because the aircraft were over Russian airspace when they fired the missiles, the no-fly zone would not have been effective.",
    "But if this expands and an Article 5 situation happens, and suddenly NATO is ready to take action, that's a very real possibility and something that should give us all a great deal of pause.",
    "A Ukrainian official, Maxym Kozytskiy, the Lviv city state administration director, said that the airstrikes had taken off from the Sea of Azov in the Black Sea from Russian naval ships.",
    "And to hear the Ukrainians tell it, the Russians never stick to their promises, for example, about providing a humanitarian passageway for folks to get out of Ukraine and aid to come in.",
    "JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Neil, we have learned more about the Russian missile strike at the base 12 miles from the Polish border in Western Ukraine.",
    "Over the weekend, in the capital, Kyiv, President Zelenskyy visited a hospital to meet with injured Ukrainian troops, who have kept Russian forces out of the capital for 19 days now.",
    "But we have been very clear that NATO is going to be defended, and Poland is a member of NATO, as well as the Czech Republic, Slovaks and Romanians and others on that eastern flank.",
    "Threatening them just says -- just signals to them, either should I ignore this, or how can I work around this, or how can I make sure my defenses are good, so I can survive this?",
    "Well, our sources have confirmed that Russia did in fact reach out to China to get that economic assistance and military assistance at some point after the start of the invasion.",
    "The mayor of Melitopol, who had been outspoken against the invasion, speaking out on social media even once Russian troops were in his town, he was taken away by Russian forces.",
    "Even if they are overcome on the battlefield, it is not in the American interest that the Russians be permitted to put together their sphere of influence back in the East again.",
    "But this comes as much of corporate America is telling their people to slowly, but surely return physically to their offices, and that this will happen over the next few months.",
    "It's a never-ending wave of refugees that are either given a ticket to go somewhere where they may have a relative or friends, or the job begins of trying to find them shelter.",
    "(END VIDEO CLIP)\nPERGRAM: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate would address inflation this month, but there's little evidence of that promise so far -- Neil.",
    "GRIFFIN: Well, right now, I think the U.S. position is the same, that a no-fly zone would put us war planes into direct conflict with the Russian - - with Russian warplanes.",
    "And because we are spending as a nation well over $4 a gallon, AAA found that six out of every 10 drivers are going to be changing their driving habits because of the cost.",
    "DAVIS: Yes, if you strike, if any Russian weapon strikes at NATO territory, a NATO soldier and kills them or destroys them, I mean, I can't see how it wouldn't trigger it.",
    "Running questions as to whether Russia really did reach out to China for economic, but the more worrisome development, military support for its ongoing battle in Ukraine.",
    "It's already acknowledged, I guess, and you're the expert, that they're going to make up or try to make up for a lot of the loss of oil customers Russia is going to have.",
    "JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We believe we will continue to be able to flow substantial amounts of military assistance and weapons to the front lines.",
    "Those strikes were so close to Poland that the video we have of the explosions was actually recorded by people with their cell phones on the Polish side of the border.",
    "And so to describe them as safe wouldn't quite be accurate, but we believe that we have methods and systems in place to be able to continue to support the Ukrainians.",
    "CAVUTO: General, I want to thank you very, very much, watching it very, very closely, General Danny Davis, the Defense Priorities senior fellow, among other things.",
    "Kyiv is about 700 miles from here, to give you a sense of the proportions, but, certainly, that attack on that military base close to the Polish border resonating.",
    "All right, let's go to Chad Pergram right now, because, no matter who you want to blame for this, you do not want to be the party in power when this is going on.",
    "What we're hearing from the Pentagon now, through the reporting of Jennifer Griffin, quoting a senior defense official, is that only aircraft fired the missiles.",
    "How every night, hearing these sirens and the planes, how are they just -- obviously, they have buckled up and all of that, but how day by day do they handle it?",
    "DAVIS: Neil, I just got to tell you, I would argue vehemently, however cold and dispassionate it may seem, that we cannot, cannot use lethal means in a response.",
    "But, as you point out, that attack on a Ukrainian military base literally less than 15 miles from the Polish border has created a whole new angle to this story.",
    "Try a little more than six miles, all of this as we're getting a dispute from the Russians, that they have never called on China for military or economic help.",
    "The Yavoriv base that was targeted was also not a transshipment point for us weapons, according to a senior U.S. defense official who I spoke to this morning.",
    "I know there was hours and hours of work done behind the scenes to gets to a place where we knew it was going to get done, both on the House and Senate side.",
    "And what you talk about there, that strike in Yavoriv, Ukraine, he says has everyone on NATO's eastern flank very alert and very much involved at this point.",
    "Like most gas stations, this one offers a cheaper price if you pay in cash, and I saw multiple people using that option to save a couple cents per gallon.",
    "But, certainly, that attack over the weekend put a whole new spin on this, if you like, because to this point, the actual conflict of had been far east.",
    "In the meantime here, we're getting some word out of this great return to work on the part of Americans, and that extends to the United States Congress.",
    "This morning, there was a letter from 15 bipartisan members of Congress, saying that the U.S. should impose secondary sanctions if necessary on China.",

    "Congress passed a $13.6 billion aid package to Ukraine last Thursday, and the president signed off on a $200 million weapons package this weekend.",
    "Officially, the National Security Council is not going to weigh in on that because they want to protect intelligence gathering sources, I am told.",
    "They say -- that is, the Russians -- that's a plant and a threat that the West is foisting on the global community that they're not entertaining.",
    "And you have seen in some of the -- I believe that your correspondents there just talking about some errant Russian missiles hitting a sidewalk.",
    "This was an air-launched cruise missile strike from long-range bombers from inside Russian airspace, not from Russian warships in the Black Sea.",
    "I think that's an effort to draw the Chinese into the conflict, just as I think that there have been efforts to draw the West into the conflict.",
    "So the point is, by just saying I might do something, you are telegraphing to the enemy exactly what they know that they have to work around.",
    "They did not say when it's going to go into effect, or how much they're planning on making it, but both of these companies taking that step.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I understand that the price of freedom of Ukrainians and the understanding of Russians is different.",
    "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nTOBIN: Mayor, what is your message to the Western leaders, who are so afraid about being dragged into a broader conflict?",

    "A 10-year note, which might seem rather arcane, but a lot of mortgages, investments are pegged at that, backed up to nearly 2.14 percent.",
    "CAVUTO: Ambassador, what do you read into Vladimir Putin's supposed overtures to China for economic and, more tellingly, military help?",
    "If we really wanted to prevent China from aiding Russia, we would have hammered them at the start of the war and held them accountable.",
    "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nCAVUTO: All right, in case you're counting, they have had four rounds of peace talks -- that is, Ukraine and Russia.",

    "And then, if it is done, they will deny it to give people plausible deniability not to make the hard decisions to sanction them.",
    "And I don't think that any kind of negotiations with Russia on this stage would be fruitful or will bring some positive results.",
    "And I hope that they're aware of the danger that could be to them as well, and they don't take that chance, that gamble again.",
    "The White House says that yesterday's missile strike will motivate them to accelerate shipments of weapons to the Ukrainians.",
    "And they're going to threaten them that, if they go along with the United States, that there will be repercussions for this.",
