    "“I think what the Arizona Democrats did was exactly right.”\nSanders went on to say that while the 2024 elections — in which both Sinema and Manchin are up for new terms — is still some time off, “if there were strong candidates in those states who were prepared to stand up for working families, who understand that the Democratic Party has got to be the party of working people taking on big money interests, if those candidates were there in Arizona and West Virginia, yes, I would be happy to support them?.”\nRep.

    "The Arizona Democratic Party announced Saturday that Sinema had been formally rebuked for what it called “her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy.”\nS?inema and Sen.
