    "Readers may remember the bizarre exchange in which Jackson told committee members that she could not define what a “woman” is, because she “isn’t a biologist.”\nThe most recent example came on Friday, when she answered a line of written questions from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) about natural rights by stating that she didn’t “hold a position on whether individuals possess natural rights.” But while most Republican senators are in agreement with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that Jackson is unquestionably a “no” vote, it’s possible that some of the usual suspects in the GOP somehow remain on the fence about this truly out-of-the-mainstream nominee.",
    "New York Post:\nIn the eight child-porn cases that came before her court, former D.C. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson heard horrifying details of “sadomasochistic” torture of young kids — including “infants and toddlers” — yet challenged the disturbing evidence presented by prosecutors and disregarded their prison recommendations to give the lightest possible punishments in each case, according to transcripts of sentencing hearings obtained by the Post.",
    "In some cases, she even apologized to some of the kiddie-porn perverts for having to follow the statutes, which she called “substantially flawed.”\n[…]\nIn July 2020, Jackson gave the bare minimum sentence to a defendant convicted of distributing images and videos of infants being sexually abused, and who had boasted of molesting his 13-year-old cousin, even though she knew the defendant refused “to take full responsibility” for his crimes, a transcript reveals.",
    "But she declined to enhance his prison time based on the amount of porn he distributed, arguing such enhancements were “outdated” and “substantially flawed.” She acknowledged the average sentence nationally “for similarly situated defendants” was 81 months, but she gave him the statutory mandatory-minimum sentence of 60 months, which was short of the nearly six years prosecutors asked for.",
    "Along with the release of the transcripts and memos (which can be read here), digital ads by conservative advocacy group The Article Three Project, containing damning facts from the documents, began airing Friday in eight states across the country, including in my own state of Arizona (Note: the top video below is a general ad; the bottom ad is geared toward Arizona.)",
    "Downs, then 30, told the group, “I once fooled around with my 13-year-old cousin.” He also uploaded a 10-second video of “a prepubescent female lying in a bathtub and with an adult male inserting his penis into her mouth.”\nIt continues:\nJackson herself admitted that the felon was at “risk of reoffending,” the transcript further reveals.",
    "Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly — both Democrats — have pushed back on recent, radical moves from the Biden Administration, including the sunsetting of the Title 42 immigration policy put in place by President Donald Trump.",
    "It’s not outside the realm of possibility that swing-state Democrats like them (and some squish Republicans) could be persuaded to stand against this wrongheaded and disastrous nominee to the highest court in the land.",
    "There have been numerous red flags about the fitness of Biden nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court throughout her Senate confirmation hearings over the past two weeks.",
    "In 2018, Christopher Michael Downs was busted trading child porn in a private online chat room, “Pedos Only,” including images of adult males raping “a prepubescent female child,” according to court records.",
    "In addition, Jackson gave him credit for time served starting from when he was first incarcerated in October 2018, so technically she gave him only 38 months, or a little over three years, in the pen.",
    "Now, there’s written proof that the previously reported revelations about Judge Jackson’s extremely lenient sentencing in cases involving sex offenders were just the tip of the iceberg.",
    "(You can find all of the ads in this Twitter thread, if you need it to share with your lawmaker/s in Arizona, Georgia, Utah, West Virginia, Alaska, Maine, Nevada, or New Hampshire.)",
    "(And I’ll warn you in advance: some of the content is not easy to read, as it involves crimes against children, even babies, and contains graphic descriptions of sex acts.)",
    "Senators @SenMarkKelly and @SenatorSinema must consider the future of the children of Arizona before elevating Judge Jackson to the highest court in the land.",
    "On Friday, courtroom transcripts and prosecutor memos from the cases on Jackson’s docket with defendants accused of distributing child-porn were released.",
    "pic.twitter.com/bh4CRWuOFi\n— The Article III Project (A3P) (@Article3Project) April 1, 2022\nAs my colleague Nick Arama previously wrote, Arizona Sens.",
    "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is the wrong person to uphold our values and preserve our Founding documents as a lifetime member of the Supreme Court.",
    "And of course, there might be some on the other side of the aisle who aren’t in lockstep with the far-left looneys in the Democrat Party.",
    "And we must make sure that our representatives in Washington know our will at this crucial moment in our nation’s history.",
    "He posted 33 graphic photos, including an image of a naked female child as young as 2 years old.",
    "I encourage you to read the details on the other cases outlined in the Post’s piece.",
    "Downs is scheduled for release in December."
