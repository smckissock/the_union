    "Specifically, Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona, Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Sen. Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire and Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto in Nevada…\nTrending: Steve Hilton: The Idea Of A Second Term For Joe Biden Is Absurd And Offensive (VIDEO)\nSo Democrats are likely to lose 3-4 Senate seats this year and that’s just the start of their troubles.",
    "However, the President’s party also tends to decline in standing as the midterms approach, as the graph below shows (you can read more about the historical evidence for this decline here)…\nAdditionally, polls have been biased towards Democrats in two of the last three cycles, and there is reason to think this bias will persist.",
    "Hot Air suggests the Democrats could lose 3-4 Senate seats:\nFor comparison purposes, when Cook Political Report published its analysis of House races, they suggested the generic ballot had shifted 7 points toward the GOP since 2020.",
    "This means Republicans will probably win the generic ballot by between three and six percent, and the median scenario is probably Republicans winning by around 4.5%.",
    "Between those two factors, it’s reasonable to assume that Democrats are looking at a vote share between 47% and 48.5% this cycle.",
    "Since Joe Biden won by 4.5% in 2020, this would mean that the national environment has shifted 9 percentage points to the right.",
    "The result of this is that Senate Democrats who won in states Biden won by less than 9 points are probably in trouble.",
    "From Slow Boring:\nTraditionally, the President’s party averages roughly 47.5% of the two-party vote1 in midterms.",
    "Evryone already expects that Democrats are going to lose the House this November in the midterms.",
    "Right now, in FiveThirtyEight’s average of public polls, Democrats are polling at 48.7%.",
    "This would cause a full-on meltdown on the left and it could very well happen.",
    "Bazelon goes on to point out that 2024 is looking ever worse for Democrats.",
    "But now it’s starting to look like they could lose the Senate too.",
    "The current 48.7% polling average may well be an overestimation.",
    "If that happens, Biden’s presidency is effectively over.",
    "The Slow Boring analysis puts the shift at 9 points."
