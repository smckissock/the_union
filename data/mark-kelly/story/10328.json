    "WASHINGTON, D.C.— In response to the Senate’s failed effort to move David Weil’s nomination forward, Adam Brandon, FreedomWorks President, commented:\n“We applaud the 50 Republican Senators and the three Democratic Senators–West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly–who voted against cloture on the nomination of David Weil to be Administrator of the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division.”\n“Weil’s confirmation to this position would have harmed workers as well as employers, particularly small businesses.",
    "Instead of letting Americans choose what works best for them, Weil would have wielded the power of the federal government to impose a one-size-fits-all model of employment–solely to benefit organized labor, whose membership has dramatically declined nationwide.”\nFreedomWorks led a coalition of 10 free-market groups in opposition to the nomination.",
    "Other Americans view owning a franchise as fulfilling the dream of having their own business.",
    "Many Americans want the flexibility that being an independent contractor offers."
