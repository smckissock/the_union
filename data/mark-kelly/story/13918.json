    "“Mayor Diak … expressed concerns about the historically low water levels at Lake Powell negatively impacting tourism and recreation industries, which serve as the city of Page’s main economic driver,” the statement said, adding, “Our infrastructure law invests over $3 billion to address aging water infrastructure, and I’m proud to work with Mayor Diak and ensure the City of Page receives their fair share of infrastructure funds.”\nAccording to Sen. Sinema, $82.8 million of Arizona’s funds will go toward strengthening water systems and environmental infrastructure throughout the state, while more than $50.5 million will be invested in Arizona this year for critical drought relief measures.",
    "“That appears to be a very, very viable option because the money is there now, but we’ve just got to make sure that we put ourselves in a position to get that funding.”\nToward that end, the city has been lobbying Arizona’s congressional leaders – not just Sen. Sinema, but also Sen. Mark Kelly and Rep. Tom O’Halleran – to make sure Page is on everyone’s radar when the funding is allocated.",
    "It’s very, very problematic for the boaters as well as the region, the congestion out there.”\nHe said the while the National Park Service is looking for long-term solutions to the problems caused by low water levels, temporary fixes are needed to help the community and local businesses get through the coming months, and to give boaters easier access to the lake.",
    "My conversation with Sen. Sinema was about the critical water issue for the City of Page, not the region.”\nThe city has been working with California-based Carollo Engineers to design a new pipeline to draw water from the Chains area of Lake Powell, about 300 yards upstream from the dam, and transport it to the water treatment plant.",
    "“That was one of the things I was pointing out to our congressional representatives: We need those temporary fixes while we figure out what the new norm is going to be,” he said, adding that the delegates’ visit provided an opportunity to explain critical water issues to people who can take the message back to Washington.",
    "According to a statement later released by Sen. Sinema’s office, that phone call focused on ensuring that Page receives its fair share of funds earmarked for Arizona from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that was signed into law last November.",
    "According to that plan, the pipeline would pump water from the lake near the Chains area upstream from the dam and carry it to Page, Tuba City, Cameron, Flagstaff and Williams, with a spur going off at Cameron to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.",
    "The resulting reduction in places where boats can refuel has “eliminated the whole center section of the lake” and “created a congestion zone all in one area because people need to stay where they can have some fuel,” Diak said.",
    "We have been positioning ourselves to have funding to work toward that process, and while we’ve been banking some money for the next opportunity, the Build Back Better infrastructure bill came out,” Diak said.",
    "In an interview with the Chronicle earlier this month, Diak said the main thrust of his conversation with Sen. Sinema was about implementing another straw to draw water from Lake Powell for the City of Page.",
    "Among the areas toured by the delegates was the former site of Dangling Rope Marina, which had been closed for months before being permanently removed earlier this year.",
    "So, we need a completely new system separate from the dam.”\nThe solution seemed to be a federal project that was in the works at the time called the Navajo Pipeline.",
    "In particular, money is needed to help rebuild the city’s aging water infrastructure and improve the response to low water levels at Lake Powell.",
    "In 2004, the Bureau of Reclamation conducted a survey of the dam, which concluded that the pipe through the dam was nearing the end of its life.",
    "Currently, Page gets its water from a 12-inch pipe that was installed at the base of the Glen Canyon Dam during its construction in the 1960s.",
    "“Last summer, the line to launch your boat in the mornings was nearly a mile long, and then you’ve got that same process in the evening going.",
    "One morning late last month, City of Page Mayor Bill Diak received an unexpected phone call from an aide to Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.",
    "Last month, aides to all three of Arizona’s congressional leaders visited Page to also look at water issues on Lake Powell.",
    "It’s good to have support because they’ll have an awareness of the situation and because they all vote on it,” Diak said.",
    "The aide wanted to know whether the mayor was available for a phone call from Sen. Sinema herself later that afternoon.",
    "“The bureau said that because of the age of the infrastructure of the dam, they will not upgrade the pipe.",
    "If the pipe through the dam was at end of life then, it’s certainly getting critical at this time.",
    "However, after many years of planning, the project was abandoned by the federal government.",
    "“We only have one access point now,” he said, referring to the Stateline Auxiliary Ramp.",
    "Diak was travelling at the time, but he said he’d be happy to take the call anyway.",
    "“At that time, we started looking at other avenues for a second straw,” Diak said.",
    "“It’s something that we’ve been working on for years and years,” he said.",
    "They were accompanied by aides to congresspeople from the Utah side.",
    "“It gave us a good opportunity to bring those people into the loop.",
    "He said the city is also looking for better access to the lake.",
    "The estimated cost of the project is between $40-55 million.",
    "“If we’re not out there shaking that tree, nobody else is.",
    "I just try to leverage what’s best for our community.”",
    "“That put is back to square one,” Diak said.",
    "“Here we are almost 20 years later.",
    "“It’s not an inexpensive project.",
    "When it fails, it will be done.",
    "It will be abandoned."
