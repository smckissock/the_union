Eric Swallwell, a California Democrat, said Republicans have “gone all in on using violence as a path to power.”\nLamon spokesperson Stephen Puetz responded to criticism of the ad by saying: “Unlike Kelly, Jim Lamon will shoot straight with Arizonans and take the fight to Biden — and he damn sure won’t let the left bully him into backing down.”\nA spokesperson for Kelly’s campaign, Sarah Guggenheimer, declined to comment.",
