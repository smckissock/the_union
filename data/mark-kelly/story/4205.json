John Cornyn, who says: “I think there’s going to be a big contrast in Arizona where one senator said not withstanding her support for the legislation she believes it’s important … to have bipartisanship and one senator that doesn’t.”\nSinema and Cornyn in June (photo above) toured U.S. Customs and Border Protection migrant facilities in her home state of Arizona, as she held a press conference praising the filibuster.",
    "Adam Jentleson, who served as Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Deputy Chief of Staff and is an expert on the Senate, says the Arizona Democrat is “hurting all Democrats.”\nHe points to this tweet from CNN’s Manu Raju: “GOP planning to use Sinema against Mark Kelly.” Kelly is the freshman Democratic Senator, also from Arizona who serves with Sinema.",

    "Jentleson, who literally wrote the book on the filibuster, explains:\nMore evidence that Sinema is hurting all Democrats – especially her fellow Arizonan, Mark Kelly.",
    "Senator Kyrsten Sinema‘s refusal to support changes to the filibuster could help hand control of the Senate to Republicans in the November election.",
    "Kelly’s seat is critical to holding the Senate majority, and Sinema is giving Republicans fodder to attack Kelly.",
    "A well-known former top Democratic aide is warning that U.S.",
    "His seat is a prime target for Republicans."
