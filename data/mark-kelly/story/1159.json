    "In the House, Reps. Marie Newman (D-Ill.), Mark Green (R-Tenn.) and Barry Moore (R-Ala.) and others have also personally traded cryptocurrencies or reported their immediate families doing so, according to financial disclosures.",
    "Therefore, even though the Warren-Daines bill doesn’t mention cryptocurrencies by name, it’s highly likely that its passage would force members of Congress who own cryptocurrencies to sell of their stakes in order to comply.",

    "Regulators are still debating how to classify cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, but there’s a general consensus in the US that they are either commodities or securities.",
    "“It’s hard to say that people aren’t going to have a financial interest in that.”\nWhile the Warren-Daines bill is far from being passed, it appears to be gaining steam, with Sens.",
    "As Senators debate how to combine the proposals, cryptocurrency trading is on the table but there is no clear consensus on whether it should be banned, the source said.",
    "Other points of negotiation include whether the ban should also cover trading by members of Congress’ spouses, immediate families or staff members.",
    "A ban on trading by spouses may have to be jettisoned in order to garner GOP support, sources said.",
    "Currently, three members of the US Senate have reported owning cryptocurrencies — Sens.",
    "Similarly to the Warren-Daines bill, legislation introduced last month by Sens.",
