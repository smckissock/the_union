    "The ad is set up as a classic Western movie in which Lamon, playing a sheriff, duels with Biden, Pelosi, and Kelly, who are all depicted as masked bandits.",
    "The video drew an immediate and negative reaction from many Twitter users, some of whom said they had reported Lamon for promoting violence.",
    "\"Arizona has had enough of the DC Gang’s open borders, high gas prices, and shifty politicians pushing us around,\" Lamon wrote on Twitter.",
    "Lamon draws his gun and fires at the three figures, shooting the weapons they're holding out of their hands and causing them to flee.",
