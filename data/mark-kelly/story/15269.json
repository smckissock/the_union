    "“These things are at the State Department level, we act as the middle liaison between constituents and federal entities.”\nAnd then there were money issues.",
    "After his interview with The Republic, Ahmad left the office carrying out a prayer rug in one hand, and a small wooden chair for his daughter in the other.",
