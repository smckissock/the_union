    "Other concerns include potential polling issues for Vance:\nThough Trump's press shop had already written up an endorsement of Vance, a source close to Mandel’s campaign said Thursday that it threw up a last-minute obstacle for the former president to consider: an internal Republican poll conducted by his campaign showing Mandel in front with 33 percent of the vote, followed by Matt Dolan and Mike Gibbons tied at 15 percent.",
    "Similarly, Republican-turned-CNN wunderkind Alyssa Farah recently lamented that she “can’t believe we are losing Rob Portman for potentially this guy.” Farah does not realize that in Ohio, where Trump won both 2016 and 2020 by eight points, her disavowal of Vance is akin to a glowing endorsement.",
    "The report also indicates that Trump had been calling others to get their opinion on him endorsing Vance, though other Republican figures have been hoping he'd endorse other candidates, such as Josh Mandel, who formerly served in the Ohio House of Representatives and as the Ohio State Treasurer.",
    "From the report:\nIn recent days, Trump began calling donors and advisers to get their opinion endorsing on the “Hillbilly Elegy” author, but he held off under intense pressure from the rival Republican campaigns of Josh Mandel and Jane Timken, the sources said.",
    "In a piece for American Greatness, Cortes addressed why he supports Vance, also acknowledging that the candidate was wary of Trump in 2016, but has since warmed up to him:\nLike any advocate of bold reforms, Vance has drawn the scorn of plenty of effete elites.",
    "The poll showed that, even with Trump's endorsement, Vance rose to 15 percent support but was still in a three-way tie for second with Mandel marginally in the lead at 19 percent — a sign that Trump's endorsement had weight but was not determinative.",
    "https://t.co/2CqGmkxTlP\n— Steve Cortes (@CortesSteve) April 14, 2022\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) also tweeted about Vance earlier on Thursday, sharing a tweet from last August that included a clip of Vance appearing on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"",
    "\"The Mandel people hit the roof,\" one Republican with knowledge of the discussions told NBC News, noting that Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan tried to dissuade Trump on behalf of Mandel, whom the congressman supports.",
    "https://t.co/8x0gb9uCHt\n— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) April 14, 2022\nIt's worth noting, however, that the endorsement has not yet come, and it may not come after all, though Trump would likely not endorse anyone, then.",
    "The battle for the U.S. Senate, which Democrats currently only control because Vice President Kamala Harris serves as a tie-breaking vote, could come down to Ohio's Senate seat with the retirement of Sen.",

    "Vance.” Neither Vance nor his supporters should worry about the condemnation of a former Harvard professor, MSNBC pundit, and associate of the scandal-plagued Lincoln Project.",
    "What’s more, his embrace of the 45th president and Trump’s agenda cost him dearly—he immediately lost the adoration of the elites who had formerly welcomed him.",
    "And those who have spoken to Trump or his advisers in recent days say he sees the most growth opportunity with Vance and a chance to make a real difference.",
    "Cook Political Report has it at \"Lean Republican,\" while Sabato's Crystal Ball is at \"Likely Republican\" and Inside Elections is \"Solid Republican.\"",

    "— Not a biologist (@MichaelRCaputo) April 14, 2022\nVance already has support from Steve Cortes as well, who also formerly advised Trump.",
    "Should Trump do so, it will come after he endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz last weekend, though not all were happy with that endorsement either.",
    "Michael Caputo, who formerly advised Trump, indicated over Twitter in a reply to the report that he is encouraging support for Vance.",
    "Reporting today that Pres Trump will endorse @JDVance1\nWould be the right move for 45 and a big boost for Vance in Ohio!",

    "And it’s only nobody if somehow the other campaigns can get him to hold off,\" the source continued.",
    "Like millions of Americans—myself included—Vance was indeed suspicious at first of Donald Trump.",
    "Trump won Ohio in 2016 with 51.7 percent of the vote and in 2020 with 53.3 percent of the vote.",
    "The Republican field is a particularly crowded field, with some memorable contentious moments.",
    "In public poling, Mandel and Gibbons lead the pack with roughly 20 percent of the vote each.",
    "But, once won over by President Trump’s policy successes, Vance quickly reversed himself.",
