    "#BREAKING: FBI Whistleblower Raises Questions about January 6 Pipe Bomb Investigation pic.twitter.com/L2fzDMxQpB\n— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) March 9, 2022\nThe Letter\n“We have received a whistleblower disclosure from a senior FBI special agent concerning the investigation into the pipe bombs placed near the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee on January 5, 2021,” Jordan wrote to FBI chief Christopher Wray:\nAccording to the special agent, on February 7, 2022 — over a year after the placement of the bombs — the FBI’s Washington Field Office asked FBI field offices to canvass all confidential human sources nationwide for information about the individual and the crime.",
    "“The FBI, however, has not fully responded to Rep. Posey’s request, explaining that it was exclusively providing information to the partisan Democrat-led Select Committee investigating the events of January 6, 2021,” Jordan continued:\nThe FBI’s decision to provide information on a partisan basis is antithetical to the FBI’s purported impartiality and it further erodes public confidence in the FBI’s senior leadership.",
    "In part, the message asked that the canvass “include sources reporting on all [types of] threats” because the suspect’s “motive and ideology remain unknown.” The special agent explained that the WFO request was “unusual” because it was transmitted more than a year after the FBI had begun the investigation, and it raises questions about the progress and extent of the FBI’s investigation.",
    "The question is why the FBI will cooperate only with the Democrat majority on the select committee investigating the “insurrection.”\nAmusingly, the FBI is providing information exclusively to a committee whose chairman, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, was an insurrectionist sympathizer in his salad days.",
    "Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, has asked the FBI to provide an immediate briefing regarding the agency’s investigation into the pipe bombs left at the headquarters of the Democrat and Republican parties on January 5 last year.",
    "Thompson’s boon companions killed a cop and wounded an FBI agent, and threatened “guerilla warfare” against the United States, the bureau warned, as part of a deranged plan to take over several southern states and form a country called New Africa.",
    "It was the night before the mostly peaceful protest that Democrats and their leftist Media Information Ministry falsely claim was an “insurrection” against the government.",
    "The Bomb\nThe FBI said in January that investigation is a priority, and is offering $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of the suspect, who didn’t plant fakes.",
    "The FBI has not “sufficiently” answered questions from GOP Representative Bill Posey of Florida about the status of the probe, Jordan wrote.",
    "and headed for the Republican National Committee on First Street, S.E., where he planted the second bomb some between then at 8:18 p.m.",
    "“Investigators are keying in on the mannerisms of the suspect, specifically looking at the way the suspect walks,” ABC reported.",
    "A year later, as January 6 protesters suffer in gulag-like conditions in D.C. jails, the would-be bomber remains at large.",
    "Posey wrote to the agency in September; the agency hasn’t answered him because he’s not a Democrat.",
    "In September, the FBI released video of the suspect that shows his route from North Carolina, S.E.",
    "A half century ago, Thompson’s radical comrades planned an insurrection against the United States.",
    "The bomber wore gloves, a hooded gray or heather sweatshirt, and either blue jeans or dark pants.",
    "The agent said the bureau has conducted 900 interviews and collected 39,000 videos and 400 tips.",
    "A whistleblower contacted the committee to say the agency was up to some “unusual” activities.",
    "The would-be bomber left the devices in front of the two buildings between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m.",
    "at 7:34 p.m. to the Democratic National Committee on South Capitol Street, S.E.",
    "The bomber sat on a bench, left the bomb, then walked back to North Carolina.",
    "They could have exploded,” an FBI agent told ABC News in January.",
    "And the pipe bombs, thankfully, did not explode.",
    "Jordan demanded an agency briefing by March 23.",
    "Eight minutes later, he was at 2nd Street, S.E.",
    "An “insurrection” the protest wasn’t.",
    "The FBI is, in a word, clueless.",
    "“They would have exploded.",
    "It was 8:00 p.m.",
    "Still, nothing."
