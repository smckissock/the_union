    "As these scientists flip-flop, they’ve received grants from Dr. Fauci in the past, and they’ll be receiving them in the future.”\nRep. Jim Jordan added, “Drs.",
    "More than two years into the pandemic, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Americans don’t trust Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top White House COVID-19 adviser.",
    "Months later, in May 2020, they received 8.9 million in grant money from Fauci.”\nMarshall said, “Woven in these stories is EcoHealth and Peter Daszak.",
    "And perhaps the most troubling thing is if anyone questions the policy or so-called science, the powerful elites bully or censor you.",
