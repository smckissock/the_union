    "“Congressmen like Jim Jordan, Scott Perry, and others in the Freedom Caucus need conservative fighters to work with them in the House, and they know that Casey Wardynski is the only candidate in this race that will stand with them and further an America First agenda.”\n“The Freedom Fund endorsement is highly sought after, and we’re glad that after thoroughly vetting the AL-5 field they recognized Casey Wardynski as the true conservative in the race,” he added.",
    "Our team is looking forward to a victory on May 24.”\nThe House Freedom Fund has designated Wardynski as one of the political action committee’s “priority candidates.”\nThe North Alabama congressional hopeful landing the House Freedom Fund’s endorsement comes on the heels of U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), founding chair of the Freedom Caucus, announcing his support of Wardynski’s campaign last week.",
    "In a statement announcing the endorsement, Wardynski campaign manager Chad Niblett said that the former U.S. Army colonel would work to advance the “America First agenda.”\n“We’re honored that Casey has earned the endorsement of the House Freedom Fund,” stated Niblett.",
    "Republican fifth congressional district candidate Casey Wardynski on Monday announced that his campaign had received the endorsement of the House Freedom Fund, the political arm of the House Freedom Caucus.",

    "“They were impressed by Casey’s record of getting CRT out of West Point, helping President Trump build the border wall, and never putting a woke agenda ahead of our nation.",
    "Outgoing U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Huntsville), along with U.S. Reps. Barry Moore (R-Enterprise) and Gary Palmer (R-Hoover) are members of the Freedom Caucus.",
