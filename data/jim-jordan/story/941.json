    "A technology expert shot back at special counsel John Durham in response to claims that he \"exploited\" access to internet traffic to build a narrative of collusion between former President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.As Trump and his allies argue that Durham has found a \"far bigger crime\" than what happened in the Watergate scandal, â€œTechnology Executive-1,\" known to be former Neustar Senior Vice President Rodney Joffe, issued a statement via a representative to combat the \"allegations\" made in the special counsel's recent court filing."
