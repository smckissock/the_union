    "Given our Committee’s jurisdiction and the importance of this issue to American commerce, we urge you to convene a hearing of the Committee soon so that we may examine and begin to address the surge in retail theft in our country.”\n“According to a 2020 study by the National Retail Federation (NRF), retail theft has risen sixty percent since 2015 and now amounts to retail-store losses of $719,548 per $1 billion in sales,” the letter continues.",
    "“ In the NRF survey, retailers “cited relaxed law enforcement guidelines, changes in shoplifting laws and decreased penalties for shoplifting among the causes for increased organized retail crime.”\nThe NYPD reported more than 26,000 shoplifting complaints from January 1 through September 12, 2021, up by roughly 6,000 for the same period in 2020.",
    "“We ask that you schedule a hearing soon to allow Committee Members to better understand the surge in retail crime across the country, examine the disastrous policies that are directly fueling it, and work toward constructive solutions to this problem.",
    "Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) has written a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) imploring him to investigate the disastrous “soft on crime” policies that have triggered a spike in shoplifting crimes nationwide.",

    "“These retail businesses are already suffering due to record inflation, a massive labor shortage, and supply chain issues,” Jordan says in the letter.",
    "“Now this surge in theft is forcing some retail stores to close permanently.",
    "We look forward to hearing from you,” Jordan concludes.",
    "Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."
