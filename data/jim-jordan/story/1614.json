    "There is no suggestion that Sullivan is a target of Special Council John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe\n'If these allegations prove true, I would find it hard to believe that there was potentially some type of collusion with a tech company that had access to servers and computers to spy on the Trump campaign - and potentially the White House - without authorization from top officials in the Clinton campaign,' Waltz said.",
    "+22\nView gallery\nFormer President Donald Trump this week praised Durham's work, claiming 'it all leads back to the Democrats, Hillary [Clinton] and the dirty lawyers' during an interview with Fox News\nDurham was appointed as special counsel by Trump administration Attorney General Bill Barr in October 2020, and tasked with investigating whether the FBI's Trump-Russia probe, code-named 'Crossfire Hurricane,' was opened and conducted legally.",
    "The Government's evidence at trial will also establish that among the Internet data Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited was domain name system ('DNS') Internet traffic pertaining to (i) a particular healthcare provider, (ii) Trump Tower, (iii) Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building, and (iv) the Executive Office of the President of the United States ('EOP').",
    "'Contrary to the allegations in this recent filing, Mr. Joffe is an apolitical Internet security expert with decades of service to the U.S. Government who has never worked for a political party, and who legally provided access to DNS data obtained from a private client that separately was providing DNS services to the Executive Office of the President (EOP),' the statement said.",
    "+22\nView gallery\nTrump (pictured golfing in West Palm on Friday) has also expressed outrage at the bombshell court filing, claiming what Clinton's campaign did amounted to 'treason'\n+22\nView gallery\nProminent Republicans came down hard on Sullivan and his former boss Hillary Clinton\nShe also said Sullivan 'lied to the American people in hopes of winning an election.'",
    "Durham's indictment made no specific claims of servers being 'infiltrated', but rather that DNS data from Trump Tower and Whitehouse servers was exploited in an attempt to document a link between Trump and Russian banks\nThe allegations have electrified Trump allies who claim them as proof that the former president was the victim of subterfuge in 2016.",
    "Rather, the Special Counsel has again made a filing in this case that unnecessarily includes prejudicial—and false—allegations that are irrelevant to his Motion and to the charged offense, and are plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool,' write four lawyers from Latham & Watkins in their response.",
    "As set forth in the Indictment, on Sept. 19, 2016 – less than two months before the 2016 U.S. Presidential election – the defendant, a lawyer at a large international law firm ('Law Firm-1') that was then serving as counsel to the Clinton Campaign, met with the FBI General Counsel (James Baker) at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
    "In a footnote the lawyers take on the notion that Sussmann was acting in concert with the Clinton campaign, saying the motion 'conveniently overlooks' the fact that Sussmann's meeting with a government agency 'happened well after the 2016 presidential election at a time when the Clinton Campaign had effectively ceased to exist.'",
    "The Indictment also alleges that, beginning in approximately July 2016, Tech Executive-1 had worked with the defendant, a U.S. investigative firm retained by Law Firm-1 on behalf of the Clinton Campaign, numerous cyber researchers, and employees at multiple Internet companies to assemble the purported data and white papers.",
    "Durham's indictment alleges that Sussmann told FBI General Counsel at the time James Baker in September 2016 that he was not working or 'any client' upon requesting a meeting to show evidence that he claimed 'demonstrated a covert communications channel' between the Trump Organization and the Kremlin Alfa Bank.",
    "For example, the more complete data that Tech Executive-1 and his associates gathered – but did not provide to Agency-2 – reflected that between approximately 2014 and 2017, there were a total of more than 3 million lookups of Russian Phone-Provider-1 IP addresses that originated with U.S.-based IP addresses.",
    "In Durham's filing on Friday, he revealed how Sussmann 'had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1), named as Rodney Joffe, at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign.'",
    "In addition, the more complete data assembled by Tech Executive-1 and his associates reflected that DNS lookups involving the EOP and Russian Phone Provider-1 began at least as early 2014 (i.e., during the Obama administration and years before Trump took office) – another fact which the allegations omitted.",
    "'Rather, Mr. Sussmann has been charged with making a false statement about an entirely ancillary matter—about who his client may have been when he met with the FBI—which is a fact that even the Special Counsel's own Indictment fails to allege had any effect on the FBI's decision to open an investigation.'",
    "The Government's evidence at trial will establish that these additional allegations relied, in part, on the purported DNS traffic that Tech Executive-1 and others had assembled pertaining to Trump Tower, Donald Trump's New York City apartment building, the EOP, and the aforementioned healthcare provider.",
    "'We can't get distracted, whether it's by the latest culture war nonsense, or some new right wing lie on Fox or Facebook - by the way they've been coming after me again lately in case you might have noticed,' Clinton told Democrats in a comeback speech at the party's nominating convention in New York.",
    "It also notes how former President Trump 'seized' upon the filing, and cites Trump statement that it 'provides indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia.'",
    "The key passage of the Durham filing that led to the accusations against Clinton and her campaign\nBelow is the key part of the legal filing made by Special Counsel John Durham on Friday February 11 that led to the firestorm of claims that Hillary Clinton and her campaign spied on Donald Trump.",
    "In fact, the defendant had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including (i) a technology executive ('Tech Executive-1 - identified as Rodney Jeffe) at a U.S.-based Internet company ('Internet Company1'), and (ii) the Clinton Campaign.",
    "Secret Service had parked outside of the restaurant while they are inside filming\nIn a response to the most recent accusations filed by Durham, Sussmann's legal team said Durham 'seems to be succeeding in his effort to instigate unfair and prejudicial media coverage of Mr. Sussmann's case.'",
    "'These allegations were not included in the Indictment; these allegations post-date the single false statement that was charged in the Indictment; and these allegations were not necessary to identify any of the potential conflicts of interest with which the Motion is putatively concerned.",
    "Clinton lawyer Sussman's 27-page indictment says he told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker that he was not working for a client when he asked for a meeting in which he offered evidence of what he claimed was a secret communication channel between Donald Trump and a Russian bank.",
    "Durham, in his Feb. 11th filing, said Sussmann ' had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1) at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign.'",
    "'To make this case a partisan affair and to inflame media coverage, the Special Counsel chose to include allegations that Mr. Sussmann was part of a wide-ranging scheme involving a number of uncharged parties including the Clinton Campaign, Law Firm-1, Campaign Lawyer-1, a U.S.",
    "The government's indictment of Sussmann says he told then-FBI general counsel James Baker he was not doing work 'for any client' when he brought forward information that purported to show a communications channel between the Trump Organization and Kremlin-linked Alfa Bank.",

    "Danchenko, 43, was the primary researcher for Steele's dossier alleging that Trump's 2016 presidential campaign conspired with Russia in a covert operation to beat Hillary Clinton, and that Russia had salacious videos that could be used to blackmail Trump.",
    "Sussmann pleaded not guilty and his team is now calling for the charges to be dismissed\n FOX NEWS Privacy Policy\nHillary Clinton also finally responded on Wednesday to the recent revelations from Durham's filing claiming she hired people to spy on Trump.",
    "In his meeting with Agency-2, the defendant provided data which he claimed reflected purportedly suspicious DNS lookups by these entities of internet protocol ('IP') addresses affiliated with a Russian mobile phone provider ('Russian Phone Provider-1').",
    "The Indictment further details that on February 9, 2017, the defendant provided an updated set of allegations – including the Russian Bank-1 data and additional allegations relating to Trump – to a second agency of the U.S. government ('Agency-2').",
    "In compiling and disseminating these allegations, the defendant and Tech Executive-1 also had met and communicated with another law partner at Law Firm-1 who was then serving as General Counsel to the Clinton Campaign ('Campaign Lawyer-1').",
    "The latest motion to dismiss comes after Sussmann's lawyers on Tuesday accused Durham of adding inflammatory accusations to a legal filing purely to 'taint' the jury pool and 'inflame' the media with claims that Clinton spied on Trump.",
    "Tech Executive-1 also enlisted the assistance of researchers at a U.S.-based university who were receiving and analyzing large amounts of Internet data in connection with a pending federal government cybersecurity research contract.",
