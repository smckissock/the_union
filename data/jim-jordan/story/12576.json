    "With Democrats digging in against states that have passed new laws designed to protect the rights of the unborn, Biden caught the attention of a Catholic priest after he lashed out at Florida which has just passed legislation which will ban abortion after 15 weeks with the exception of certain cases including rape and incest.",
    "Professed devout Catholic Joe Biden has drawn much criticism over his championing of abortion, a view that is contradictory to his religion which expressly forbids the taking of the lives of the unborn and the nation’s president was given notice of when he can attend confession after his latest remarks."
