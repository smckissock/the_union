    "“Trump was known to make calls using personal cell phones, which could account for those.”\n“The panel is still awaiting additional material from the National Archives and Records Administration, which keeps the official White House logs,” The New York Times adds, “and from telecommunications companies that have been subpoenaed for the personal cellphone records of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, like his son, Eric, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancée of Mr. Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr.”",
    "It has been well-documented that Trump spoke with several people, including Rep. Jim Jordan on January 6, but the incomplete records are leaving investigators “with gaps so far in their understanding of what transpired that day,” according to CNN.",
    "The White House by law is required to keep records of all calls, but logs obtained by the January 6 Committee show very few calls made to or from then-President Donald Trump on the day of the violent and deadly insurrection."
