    "Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) stopped by Fox & Friends to discuss the latest bombshell report that special counsel John Durham filed a motion in federal court alleging the Clinton campaign paid a tech firm to infiltrate Trump Tower servers —and later, the White House.",
    "Now we know 100%.”\n“John Durham’s filing here, yep, there was spying going on, and it was worse than we thought because they were spying on the sitting President of the United States, and it goes right to the Clinton campaign.",
    "And then in 2019, then-Attorney General Bill Barr said spying took place at the FBI on President Trump’s campaign, and everyone said, ‘No, no, no.’ Well, now we know for sure.",
    "“Remember back in 2017 when President Trump said, ‘They were spying on me,’ and the press and Democrats said they weren’t.",
    "The only thing we didn’t understand was it was worse than we thought.”\nWatch the clip above.",
    "It’s taken a long time, but we’re getting to now what we all suspected.",
    "So, God bless John Durham and his investigation.",
    "“President Trump was right,” Jordan stated."
