    "According to his letter, the FBI is withholding information to Congress and only dealing with partisan Liz Cheney’s illicit Jan 6 Committee.",
    "This is the very first FBI whistleblower to step forward on suspected criminal behavior by the bureau that we have heard about in years.",
    "Rep. Jordan, the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent the letter to dirty Chris Wray on Wednesday.",
    "Chris Wray and the Stasi FBI has also refused any requests from Republican lawmakers on the matter.",
    "Only far-left FBI operatives have been leaking information and lies to the media since 2016.",
