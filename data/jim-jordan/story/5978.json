    "These conversations were excerpted from Burns’ and Martin’s latest book, This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future.",
    "Rep. Liz Cheney, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and other Republican leaders in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, Capitol unrest.",
