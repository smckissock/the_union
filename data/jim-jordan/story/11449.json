    "During discussion of the bill, several Black members of Congress got up and described their own experiences with hairstyle discrimination, including Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) who talked about how even her own grandmother was afraid to be seen with her in the '60s when she had an Afro, for fear of what it signified to white people, and Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA) talking about how a female colleague in the Georgia state Senate had \"complimented\" her by saying, on a day when she straightened her hair instead of wearing it in braids, that she should keep it that way as it looked so much more \"professional.\"",

    "The other Republican who spoke against the bill was Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina, who claimed that the CROWN Act would force employers to allow hairstyles that were \"workplace safety issues,\" telling a heartbreaking story about an imaginary employer who just doesn't want his imaginary employee's scalp to be ripped off.",
