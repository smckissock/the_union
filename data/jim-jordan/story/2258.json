    "And if the people who impeached President Trump — obviously I was one of the lawyers on the other side — were aware of exculpatory evidence or evidence that would in some way mitigate the charges, they had an obligation to turn it over to us so that we could use this information in defending our client.”\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) is concerned as to why Trump’s defense did not get the email:\n“This is frightening,” Jordan told the new Just the News television show on Real America’s Voice network.",
    "Then Kent wrote:\n…that the real issue to my mind was that someone in Washington needed to engage VP Biden quietly and say that his son Hunter’s presence on the Burisma board undercut the anti-corruption message the VP and we were advancing in Ukraine, b/c Ukrainians heard one message from us and then saw another set of behavior, with the family association with a known corrupt figure whose company was known for not playing by the rules in the oil/gas sector.",
    "I mean, frankly, we Republicans who were in the rooms in that bunker in the basement of the Capitol, we’d have liked to have this information that you just described, and other information that wasn’t available to us as well, that you’ve written about.”\nDONATE\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.",
    "But then the case disappeared, Ukrainian officials unfroze the assets, and the money “transferred out of the UK.”\nKent relayed that Anatoliy Danylenko, then-deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine, told him it took a $7 million bribe to make the case against one of the cases against the company to go away.",
    "The person concluded his email: “More than one U.S. firm in the energy sector has told us the Burisma is still doing business ‘the old way’ and little has changed despite Zlochevskiy’s [sic] departure from the scene.”\nObama’s administration knew Hunter’s role with Burisma was problematic.",
    "The defense must receive all potentially exculpatory evidence:\n“The United States Supreme Court in the Brady decision ruled that when a defendant is on trial, the prosecutors cannot withhold evidence that could be exculpatory, or in any way helpful to the defendant,” Dershowitz said.",
    "Kent wrote about a discussion with then-State Department official Dan Fried, the coordinator for Sanctions Policy, centering around the corruption case against Mykola Zlochevsky, the former Ukrainian natural resources minister and Burisma founder.",
    "In a follow-up email, someone else provided more evidence of the problems with having Hunter on its board along with Devon Archer, who had been “indicted in a federal fraud case.”\nArcher had connections to then-Secretary of State John Kerry.",
    "It also found that Archer’s firms “made millions of dollars from that association:”\nTrump’s First Impeachment Trial\nTrump brought up Hunter’s involvement with Burisma when the left accused him of forcing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.",
    "In an old Breitbart article, I included numerous articles, even from leftist sites, loaded with concerns about Hunter working at Burisma, especially since President Barack Obama picked then-VP Biden to take the lead on Ukraine.",
    "I mean, the President of the United States is defending himself from a ridiculous impeachment process that the Democrats bring on him, where he wasn’t allowed to be in the depositions, wasn’t allowed to have his counsel there.",
    "Email Chain\nIn 2016, former U.S. embassy official George Kent warned State Department official Jorgan Andrews that Hunter Biden’s job with Burisma “undercut” U.S. efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine.",
    "You can tell from the tone of the email that the person implied our approach with Burisma is no better than the way Zlochevsky ran the company.",
    "Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz told Just The News that withholding the email was a “very serious constitutional violation of the Brady rule.",
    "But Kent said their discussion included the pressure by people, including Yovanovitch, to “rehabilitate” Burisma’s reputation.",
    "Just The News received a damning email that contradicts Biden’s claim that no one has ever accused his family of wrongdoing.",
    "“And the fact that we didn’t have this information during the impeachment, I think is maybe the biggest concern.",
    "A Senate report found that Hunter “formed significant and consistent financial relationships” with Zlochevsky.",
    "The FBI and MI-5 spent six months putting together a case against Zlochevsky and froze $23 million in assets.",
    "Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch classified the email as “Confidential,” the lowest form of secrecy.",
    "The person noted that Zlochevsky wanted to rehabilitate his name in Ukraine, but especially with America.",
    "“And now we find out wasn’t allowed to have information that he’s entitled to have to put on his defense.",
    "“Because in impeachment proceedings, the American public has the right to know all the evidence.",
    "Yovanovitch and Kent were star witnesses at President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial.",
    "But the person reminded the State Department that the Burisma board had Hunter and Archer.",
    "“And obviously, that has to apply to impeachment proceedings even more so,” he added.",
    "Also, Kent raised concerns about Hunter’s Burisma job before this 2016 email!",
    "The campaign also pressured people to drop investigations against Burisma.",
    "All of this happened while Hunter sat on the Burisma board.",
    "He mentioned that the U.S. did not want to get involved.",
    "But the person sent it to Andrews and CCd Kent.",
    "Burisma was well known for its corruption.",
    "Burisma paid Hunter $1 million a year.",
    "The name is blacked out on the email.",
    "Remember!",
    "Then-U.S."
