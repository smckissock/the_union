    "Throw in a few writers from libertarian Reason Magazine and a few more libertarians from the Cato Institute, along with a veritable smorgasbord of other speakers best known to their family and friends, and you have what Republican attorney Heath Mayo — founder of Principles First for America, which is hosting the summit — says will “certainly be counter-programming of CPAC.”\n“We want to come together in a visual show of support for people who have taken stands for ideas when it hasn’t been comfortable,” Mayo told CBS News.",
    "Despite raising an infinitesimal amount of money, this challenge was taken seriously enough by the media that they started taking Joe Walsh’s prior statements seriously — including, according to Axios, claims that Barack Obama was a Muslim and “traitor.”\nHe spent a decent chunk of the campaign apologizing for his past — telling BuzzFeed News that he wasn’t a racist, “but certainly I’ve said some racist things” — got almost no support and pulled out after receiving less than 1.1 percent of the vote against Trump in Iowa.",
    "He now maintains a Twitter feed in which he tells people about what music he’s listening to (he’s basic enough that he considers “Dream On” by Aerosmith “too damn cool”), his farm life and, of course, how the GOP is a vile hive of treacheries all connected to Trump:\nLooks like the parasite done took over the host https://t.co/GDfcjlTkKX\n— Denver Riggleman (@RepRiggleman) February 4, 2022\nHow far can you fall?",

    "On the plus side, though, if you’re the kind of conventioneer who misses dressing up as Han Solo for ComicCon but you’re too old for that kind of ridiculousness, Principles First will let you discreetly play-act as a real conservative for a weekend at an event where a bunch of anti-Trump hand-wringers parrot Democrat talking points.",
    "My barrel house is where I find peace pic.twitter.com/J9yIltY5k6\n— Denver Riggleman (@RepRiggleman) February 22, 2022\nIf you want to discuss “Conspiracy LLC” — which I’m also guessing has some part in that big ol’ “substantive discussion” about the conservative movement — Mr. Riggleman will be there.",
