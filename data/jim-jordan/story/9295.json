    "Wolff also describes more than one set of calls that Trump was speaking to around 3:30 p.m.\n\"But Trump remained fixed in his obsession: the election had been taken from him, and whatever happened, someone had to give it back; he could not see or think or imagine beyond this,\" the book says.",

    "Indeed, the various congressional supporters seemed increasingly less excited now that their revolt would be covered only by C-SPAN,\" the book says.",
    "While Trump finished his speech and returned to the White House by 1:20 p.m., the call logs don't reveal any calls happened again until 6:54 p.m.",
    "The monologue slowed and seemed even to cease, with a few people not even sure that this otherwise-unstoppable monologist was still on the line.",
    "At about this time, Scavino told Trump that he had been booted off Twitter—still, a temporary suspension,\" the book said.",
    "If Pence spoke to the White House after 5 p.m. it isn't clear to whom, but it certainly wasn't the president.",
