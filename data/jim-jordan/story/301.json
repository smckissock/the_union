    "The GOP I proudly was a part of for over four decades has become not the party of Lincoln, freedom and civil rights – but of voter suppression and outright racism; not of Teddy Roosevelt, national parks and trustbusting – but of slashing taxes on billionaires; not of William Howard Taft, Robert A. Taft and principled conservatism – but of worship of an authoritarian sociopath of no beliefs except in his own rantings of the day; not of Dwight Eisenhower, Stan Aronoff, John Rhodes and effective bipartisanship – but of hate and disruption; and the party of sane and measured foreign policy has become I know not what.",

    "But later in the day, the sedition caucus of 147 Republicans in Congress, sadly including our own Steve Chabot, voted to overturn a free and fair election.",
    "(I would term it Treason Party, meaning the common definition, but someone will counter that the Constitution has a specific definition.)",
    "Opinion contributor\nAs of February 2022, it is now official and incontrovertible: the Republican Party is the party of sedition.",
    "Everyone associated with the present GOP who has supported what the party has become must be driven from office.",
    "The Republican Party became the Big Lies Sedition Party, mandating that its members believe the obvious lies.",
    "Now we have Big Lie Two – that the rioters’ coup attempt was just a bunch of Rotarians visiting the Capitol.",
