    "The fact internet data executive Rodney Joffe, known to be Tech Executive-1 in the filing, went to Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann instead of the FBI over allegedly concerning findings shows the politically motivated connection of spying on the Trump campaign, Donald Trump's personal residence in Trump Tower, and the White House, Jordan told Sunday's \"The Cats Roundtable\" WABC 770 AM-N.Y.\n\"If there's a concern that Mr. Joffe finds in his work, as someone who has been contracted with by the government – if there's a concern, he should bring that information directly to the FBI,\" Jordan told host John Catsimatidis.",
    "The latest revelations from court filings by special counsel John Durham have exposed how lawyers and a White House internet contractor have effectively laundered information to \"create an inference and a narrative\" to \"frame\" former President Donald Trump, according to Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.",
    "\"What he did was, he took that information and gave it to Michael Sussmann, who was working with the Clinton campaign – and Michael Sussmann, according to the filing, was also in communication with Marc Elias, the top lawyer for the Clinton campaign.",
    "\"It looks like they were not only spying on President Trump's campaign, not only spying on him while he was president-elect, but also this took place, it looks like, while he was president of the United States,\" Jordan claimed.",
    "While some in the mainstream media, and Hillary Clinton herself, have said the allegations do not extend into the Trump administration, Jordan added \"it looks like\" it does, making inferences from the Feb. 11 Durham filing.",
    "Durham's special counsel work began during the Trump administration to find the predicate for the Russia investigation into Trump campaign collusion that ultimately was unproven by special counsel Robert Mueller.",
    "\"It sure looks like it took coordination between certain folks inside the Obama administration working [inside] the [James] Comey FBI and folks on the outside working for the Clinton campaign,\" Jordan concluded.",
    "\"This was a concerted effort – as we said already – to try to frame President Trump,\" Jordan, a top Republican on the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, told Catsimatidis.",
    "Ultimately, the data laundering from Joffe to Sussmann to the Clinton campaign and then the FBI had ties to former President Barack Obama looking into his replacement.",
    "\"If they can do it to the president of the United States, imagine what they can do to you or I, or anyone in this great country?\"",
    "Now, that's a fancy way of saying [the Democrats] were trying to frame the President of the United States.",
    "\"Durham was using the terms, 'They were trying to create an inference and a narrative.'",
    "We'll just have to wait to see what Mr. Durham comes up with.\"",
    "And then they, in turn, took that information to the FBI.\"",
    "Jordan asks \"why did they have to do it that way?\"",
    "\"But that's not what he did, John.",
    "\"He took the information to them.",
    "\"That's what it appears to be.",
