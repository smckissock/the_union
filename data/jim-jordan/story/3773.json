    "President Joe Biden said Wednesday it would be a 'disaster' for Russia if President Vladimir Putin orders an invasion of neighboring Ukraine – as he said he did not know Putin's intentions but said his counterpart doesn't want a 'full-blown war.'",
    "But the president also said publicly it was unclear what the response would be if Russia did something short of an all-out invasion – requiring the White House to move immediately to clean up his remarks.",
    "'It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do, et cetera,' Biden said at a White House press conference"
