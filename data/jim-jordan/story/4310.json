    "https://t.co/cX9r2uiOYR\n— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 24, 2022\nPattern two: A year ago, McCarthy called for an investigation into what occurred on Jan. 6 as a way to derail Trump’s second impeachment.",
    "A few hours later, we learned that counsel for the University of Virginia, on leave to aid the Jan. 6 committee’s investigation, had been fired by the newly elected Republican attorney general in the state.",
    "In it, any investigation into something that was done, usually by Trump or his allies, is cast as hopelessly partisan and dishonest, conducted by dishonest, partisan actors toward partisan, dishonest ends.",
    "“I think when you have a Republican Congress, this is all going to come crashing down,” Gingrich said during an appearance on Fox News, “and the wolves are going to find out that they’re now sheep.",
    "They’re the ones who are, in fact, going to, I think, face a real risk of jail for the kind of laws they’re breaking.”\nThe Jan. 6 committee is “basically a lynch mob,” he said at another point.",
    "Newt is just saying what every reasonable person knows is true: J6 committee members are targeting private citizens they don’t like because of their politics or associations.",
    "When the impeachment moved forward anyway — and nearly all Republicans voted against it — McCarthy opposed launching a bipartisan commission to look into the Jan. 6 events.",
    "This was on Maria Bartiromo’s show, so, given that her career is now centered on leveraging her past credibility to amplify far-right rhetoric, he didn’t get any pushback.",
    "Trump’s culpability in the Jan. 6 riot is much more clear, though Republicans are less likely than Americans overall to view him as responsible for what occurred.",
    "There was an obvious effort by Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, manifested by the dumps of stolen material and the underpowered social media efforts.",
    "Pattern one: Republican officials like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) criticized Trump and the day’s events.",
    "Backers held rallies in support of those who had been arrested, 75 of whom were charged with assault with a deadly weapon or with attacking law enforcement.",
    "In support of this idea, the right gets to work ginning up both reasons to play down what is being investigated and to cast aspersions at the investigators.",
    "A spokesperson for the new attorney general, Jason S. Miyares, insisted that the firing, one of several dozen, was not related to the House investigation.",
    "The right has worked hard to cast the formal investigation as being as toxic and biased as it claims the criminal probes into the individual rioters are.",
    "Then, after days or weeks or months of hollering from the party’s far-right core, the majority decides that, actually, what Trump did was not a big deal.",

    "He urged his supporters to come to Washington on that day, promising a “wild” protest aimed at ensuring he got a second term in office.",
    "This, of course, as those in the right-wing media universe were slowly turning those charged with violent crimes that day into martyrs.",
    "But the investigations into him, his allies and the rioters — and the links among those groups — risk winding up in a familiar place.",

    "More than half of Republicans in that poll said too much attention had been paid to the issue.",
    "He struggled to leverage federal resources to block Joe Biden’s election, without success.",
    "And that loudness forms a robust center of gravity for the right’s conversation.",
    "Trump repeatedly insisted that the 2020 election was stolen, which it wasn’t.",
    "A poll in July found that a quarter of Republicans approved of the rioters.",
    "and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), Cheney and Kinzinger became party pariahs.",
