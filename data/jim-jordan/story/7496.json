    "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Former President Donald Trump voiced regret Wednesday over not marching to the U.S. Capitol the day his supporters stormed the building, and he defended his long silence during the attack by claiming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others were responsible for ending the deadly violence.",
    "'I LIKED ZELENSKYY'\nTrump also delved into foreign policy, lashing into NATO for not doing more to help Ukraine -- Trump has repeatedly lampooned the organization -- and said he'd threatened NATO leaders during a 2018 meeting in Brussels, a notion his advisers denied vigorously at the time.",
    "When asked whether he had changed his mind on Ukraine, which he regularly criticized as president, he began speaking about his impeachment trial that was launched after he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Biden's son Hunter Biden and find an email server.",

    "\"A lot of people are a little bit surprised, I think they're very impressed with Ukraine, but they're not impressed with what NATO is doing, because a lot of people think NATO could be doing more,\" Trump said.",
    "During the attack, Trump watched television, criticized then-Vice President Mike Pence and made calls pushing lawmakers to overturn the election as a mob of his supporters ransacked the Capitol.",
    "Trump declined to relinquish the idea that he could have been reinstated as president after he lost the election, a notion that has been rejected by Republicans and even some of his advisers.",
    "Trump said he had not destroyed any call logs from the afternoon of Jan. 6 and took part in no phone calls on \"burner phones,\" although there is a large gap in his White House phone logs.",

    "He said the committee's interview with his daughter, Ivanka Trump, for eight hours this week was a \"shame and harassment,\" though he insisted he did not know what she told the members.",
    "The former president praised organizers of the rally, some of whom have received subpoenas from federal authorities, and repeatedly bragged about the size of the crowd on the Ellipse.",
