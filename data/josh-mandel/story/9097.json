    "As Mandel was taking his seat, Gibbons said, “You don’t know squat,” prompting Mandel to rise from his seat again.",
    "“You have never … you have never been in the private sector in your entire life,” Gibbons told Mandel.",
    "Don’t tell me I haven’t worked,” Mandel responded, raising his voice to Gibbons.",
    "A moderator approached the two men and attempted to defuse the situation.",
    "The primary election is set to take place on May 3 in the Buckeye State.",
    "He doesn’t have the temperament, experience or fortitude to be a U.S.",
    "Mandel’s campaign could not be immediately reached for comment.",
    "“He is only a professional at one thing: running for office.",
    "He is hell-bent on lying because he is failing.",
