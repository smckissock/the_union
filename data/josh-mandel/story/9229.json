    "On Wednesday, The Daily Beast reported that former President Donald Trump — who for months has delighted in candidates in the Ohio Republican Senate primary fighting each other for who deserves his endorsement the most — is finally starting to think they're taking things too far.",
    "This comes after a recent FreedomWorks-sponsored candidate forum in which former state treasurer Josh Mandel and financier Mike Gibbons shouted at each other and resorted to threats.",
    "Notably, Trump himself got into personal attack-laden arguments with his own primary opponents in 2016, at one point agreeing with a heckler that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is a \"pussy\".",
    "But the twice-impeached ex-president, aware of the constant Trump-cosplay in the race, remarked that he 'never' would have done what Mandel did that day.\"",
    "Mandel, who served as a Marine, leapt to his feet and confronted Gibbons for, what Mandel perceived as, minimizing his military service,\" said the report.",
    "\"Three longtime GOP operatives working on this Ohio race each independently described the debate footage as a 'shitshow,' when asked by The Daily Beast.",
    "\"Tempers flared Friday night after Gibbons told Mandel he didn’t know 'squat' about working in the private sector.",
    "According to the report, two other sources slammed both Mandel and Gibbons for \"acting like idiots.\"",
    "\"One source described former President Donald Trump as 'baffled' by the exchange.\""
