    "As soon as the news broke that Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will retire at the end of the current session, right-wing activists began declaring that Breyer had been “bullied” into stepping down and therefore Republicans must do everything they can to block whomever President Joe Biden nominates to fill that seat.",
    "pic.twitter.com/b8s2t2kW8Q\n— Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) January 26, 2022\nPenny Nance of Concerned Women for America declared that Biden must use the vacancy to unify the nation by appointing to the court a “constitutionalist” (which is conservative code for “right-wing ideologue”).",
    "https://t.co/Waw8gcmkb4 @CWforA @YWforA\n— Penny Nance (@PYNance) January 26, 2022\nProclaiming that the Senate is the “our last line of defense against radical leftist SCOTUS justices,” Ohio Republican Senate candidate Josh Mandel used the opportunity to promote his own campaign.",
    "— John Cardillo (@johncardillo) January 26, 2022\nRight-wing commentator Matt Walsh demanded that the position remain vacant until following the midterm elections in November, insisting that “it would be an assault on our democracy” to confirm any nominee before then.",
    "— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 26, 2022\nRight-wing activist Brigitte Gabriel openly asserted that it doesn’t even matter whom Biden nominates, “they must be stopped.”\nI don’t trust whoever Joe Biden nominates to replace Stephen Breyer.",
    "— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) January 26, 2022\nTaking things a step further, radical Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers called on the U.S. Senate to “filibuster, stall, delay and hold Biden’s Supreme Court pick until 2024.”",
    "— Josh Mandel (@JoshMandelOhio) January 26, 2022\nRep. Lauren Boebert proclaimed that Biden should take a hint from Breyer and “follow him out the door.”\nStephen Breyer is not the retirement we’ve been waiting for.",
    "This isn’t the time to send a squishy establishment RINO to Washington to sit back and sing kumbaya with Democrats and allow Joe Biden to appoint another justice like Kagan or Sotomayor.",
    "— Carrie Severino (@JCNSeverino) January 26, 2022\nThe Left forced Breyer off the Supreme Court and you can be sure they will require Biden to pick an extremist.",
    "Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network and Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch both asserted that Breyer had been forced out of his seat on the court.",
    "The Left bullied Justice Breyer into retirement and now it will demand a justice who rubber stamps its liberal political agenda.",
    "This presents @joebiden a great opportunity to be a unifying force for the nation by appointing a Constitutionalist to SCOTUS.",
    "And that’s what the Democrats will give them, because they’re beholden to the dark money supporters who helped elect them.",
    "— Brigitte Gabriel (@ACTBrigitte) January 26, 2022\nRight-wing commentator John Cardillo echoed that message.",
    "It would be an assault on our democracy to confirm a Supreme Court pick before the midterm elections.",
    "The US Senate is our last line of defense against radical leftist SCOTUS justices.",
    "Senate Republicans had better stand-fast and kill any Biden SCOTUS nomination.",
    "(Remember, their core goal is to pack the Supreme Court.)",
    "Democrats must let the people have their say.",
    "Justice Bryer’s retirement is not unexpected.",
    "Biden should follow him out the door.",
    "Will Republicans play along?",
    "@CWforA will be watching.",
    "They must be stopped."
