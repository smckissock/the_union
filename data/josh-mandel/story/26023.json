    "Less than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, in late-summer 2020, the consensus among researchers was that the coronavirus had originated in bats before jumping to humans — though it was possible that Chinese researchers were studying the virus in a lab when it managed to spread outside the lab.",
    "One agency \"assesses with moderate confidence that the first human infection with SARS-CoV-2 most likely was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, probably involving experimentation, animal handling, or sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\" the memo said.",
    "\"If COVID was the result of manipulation in a laboratory, it is also important to make clear that similar research is conducted worldwide, even in the U.S., and the SARS-like virus researchers in Wuhan had received funding from the U.S. and Europe,\" she said.",
    "No evidence China created the virus\nTo back up McCormick’s claim, his campaign cited an August 2021 memo from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence that summarized the views of U.S. intelligence agencies on the origin of COVID-19.",
    "Alina Chan, a microbiologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and co-author of \"VIRAL: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19,\" said COVID-19 \"may have a natural or lab origin, but no direct evidence has been found for either hypothesis.\"",
    "Battling in a crowded GOP primary campaign for an open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, businessman and Army veteran Dave McCormick singled out rival Dr. Mehmet Oz before making an unsubstantiated claim about the origins of COVID-19.",

    "McCormick’s campaign also cited a May 2021 Wall Street Journal article on a U.S. intelligence report that said three researchers from the institute became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care.",
    "In a race for an open seat in Missouri, a super PAC backing Republican Eric Greitens attacked Republican Eric Schmitt over Missouri legislation Schmitt supported that helped China, in a claim we rated Half True.",
    "Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way.",
    "Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, said it is unknown whether the virus entered humans \"through a natural accident or through a laboratory accident.",
    "Scientists who studied the coronavirus generally concluded that it resembled naturally occurring viruses, but were paying more attention to the possibility that the virus somehow leaked from the lab.",
    "Joel Wertheim, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, San Diego, said scientists have found numerous bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in southern China and Laos.",
    "Race could help decide Senate control\nThe Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and who decided not to seek re-election.",

    "University of Arizona evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey reported that the first known person sickened by the coronavirus was a vendor in a Wuhan animal market.",
    "The memo said the intelligence community agreed that \"two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident.\"",
    "If SARS-CoV-2 entered humans through a laboratory accident, the accident may have involved a natural virus or may have involved a laboratory-modified virus.\"",
    "\"There's absolutely no data to suggest China created COVID,\" said Kristian Andersen, a Scripps Research Institute professor of immunology and microbiology.",
