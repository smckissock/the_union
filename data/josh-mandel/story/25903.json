    "King asked Mandel not to invoke her father in his anti-Critical Race Theory talking points, and Mandel responded by sneering at her “lectures” and calling her a “race politics profiteer.”\nMandel’s claim to know more about King than his daughter drew notice from political observers, many of whom were not impressed:\nI know everyone’s aghast at Mandel having the gall to lecture MLK’s own daughter @BerniceKing about MLK’s legacy, but I want to focus on the second part here, about how MLK was “wrongly denied a gun permit by anti-gun racists.” https://t.co/kHcPN6wxdD\n— Kevin M. Kruse (@KevinMKruse) April 6, 2022\nWow.",

    "“There’s nothing racist about stopping Critical Race Theory and loving America.”\nThe ad has come under controversy, due to questions about whether Mandel’s campaign photoshopped him into a picture of himself standing next to African American soldiers during his military service in Iraq.",
    "I encourage you to study my father/nonviolence in full.”\nJosh: Regretfully, I do not believe that I or @TheKingCenter legitimately motivated you to film this ad, as it is in opposition to nonviolence and to much of what my father taught.",
    "https://t.co/DRWG6NELt9\n— Josh Mandel (@JoshMandelOhio) April 5, 2022\nAfter that, King referred Mandel to her father speaking about how having a gun would be counter-productive to a non-violent civil rights movement.",
