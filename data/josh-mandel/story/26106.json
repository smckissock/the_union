    "But they could take on new resonance after Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, introduced a governing plan in February that has divided the party over its call to raise taxes on millions of Americans who don’t earn enough to pay federal income taxes.",
    "“The top 20% of earners in the United States pay 82% of federal income tax — and, if you do the math, and 45% to 50% don’t pay any income tax, you can see the middle class is not really paying any kind of a fair share, depending on how you want to define it,” Gibbons said.",

    "We already know Republicans don't care because this is the same sort of stuff they repeat on Fox constantly.",
    "Some of you may remember Gibbons from the recent debate where he and Josh Mandel nearly came to blows.",
    "It might now hurt them in gerrymandered House districts, but these Senate seats are another matter."
