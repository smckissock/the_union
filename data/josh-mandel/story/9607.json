    "(Newser) – A near-physical altercation in the Republican primary for US Senate in Ohio led to a demand Monday from some military veterans that one candidate apologize for saying a rival who did two tours in Iraq never served in the private sector and didn't know anything about business.",
    "\"Gibbons owes Josh and all veterans and those currently in the service an apology, (for) implying that ‘WE’ who served our country honorably and faithfully, never earned our way working in the private sector,\" they wrote.",
    "The debate became intense almost as soon as it began as former state treasurer Josh Mandel attacked investment banker Mike Gibbons' business dealings in his opening remarks.",
    "Vance, who is also a military veteran, later slammed Mandel as \"disgraceful” for using the Marine Corps as a \"political football,\" drawing loud applause from the crowd.",
    "Mandel accused Gibbons of \"making millions\" off stock in a Chinese company, and Gibbons dismissively accused Mandel of not understanding how investments work.",
    "Soon, the two were standing face to face on the debate stage, shouting at each other as the moderator tried to keep their argument from further escalating.",
    "\"We all volunteered to serve our country away from our families, putting our lives in danger, so people like Mike Gibbons could make millions.\"",
    "The heated argument came during a debate Friday with five candidates running for the GOP nomination to replace the retiring Republican Sen.",
    "Don’t tell me I haven’t worked!” \"Back off, buddy, or you’re going to end up...,\" Gibbons told him, not finishing the sentence.",
    "But 15 veterans backing Mandel wrote an open letter Monday saying they were \"disgusted beyond belief\" at Gibbons' comments.",
    "Candidate JD Vance, a venture capitalist and author of Hillbilly Elegy, appeared unimpressed.",
    "\"You’ve never been in the private sector in your entire life,\" Gibbons charged.",
    "Come on,\" Vance said, sitting in a row with the remaining candidates.",
    "\"After rising from his seat, Mandel shouted, \"Two tours in Iraq.",
    "\"No, you’re dealing with the wrong guy,\" Mandel countered.",
    "\"You’re dealing with the wrong dude.\"",
    "Rob Portman, the AP reports.",
    "\"You watch what happens.\"",
    "(Read more Ohio stories.)",
    "\"You don’t know squat.",
    "\"This is ridiculous.\"",
    "\"Sit down."
