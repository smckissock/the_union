    "Oz Show’ for 13 seasons and was a regular guest on daytime television programs, left his show in January to run for the Senate seat left vacant following the retirement of Republican Senator Pat Toomey.",
    "Toomey sealed his political fate when he voted to convict Trump in the president’s impeachment trial over supposedly inciting an insurrection in response to the 2020 election results.",
