    "While Oz's message is strong on COVID-19 response, having said \"Washington got it wrong,\" McCormick is selling his campaign as someone who has negotiated with China, telling host Sean Spicer he is \"someone who's negotiated, gone toe to toe with the Chinese, and someone that will take the fight to China.\"",
    "Trafalgar Group was one of most accurate pollsters in 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, having the ability to get to America First supporters of former President Donald Trump and making Oz's 11Â½-point edge over the next closest competitor a significant development.",

    "\"We need a whole of nation strategy that reduces our dependence on China, and also ensures that we're not doing things with our trade or investments that are ensuring Chinese military modernization or its rise,\" McCormick said.",
    "\"I have the best chance of beating the Democrats in the fall because I will bring together a coalition of independents and conservative Democrats who come along with all the Republicans who know what's going on.\"",
    "Dr. Mehmet Oz has taken a big lead in the hotly contested Republican Senate primary in Pennsylvania, garnering more than 27% support among likely voters, according to the latest Trafalgar Poll.",

    "The Trafalgar Group polled 1,070 likely GOP primary voters between Feb. 1-4, and the results have a margin of error of 2.99 percentage points.",
    "\"People know who I am,\" Oz told Newsmax's \"Spicer & Co.\" \"I've been in your living room every day for 13 years.",
    "Oz leads a field of candidates that includes former U.S. ambassadors and a member of the Trump administration.",
    "Oz has led the polls on the power of his fame, having been a wide broadcast TV doctor.",
    "\"And so we need tough-minded leaders in Washington that can take that fight to China.\"",
    "\"I'll be the only one that can hold our base together and also track suburban voters.",
