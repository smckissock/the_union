    "PA Headlines 4/20/22\nYORK – PennLive/Fox 43 is reporting… The Northern York School Board will consider a proposal to create an “After School Satan Club” at the district’s elementary school at its school board meeting Tuesday, April 19.",
    "“The Satanic Temple holds to the basic premise that undue suffering is bad, and that which reduces suffering is good.” The Northern York School Board will meet tonight at 7 p.m. in the high school’s auditorium.",
    "“We believe that Satan is a great metaphor for rebellion against tyranny and is the embodiment of all of the values we espouse,” Mesner told Fox43, which reported Monday on the requests to form the club.",
    "Despite its name, the club is not devoted to Satan worship or any kind of proselytizing, according to The Satanic Temple’s cofounder Douglas Mesner—better-known as ‘Lucian Greaves’.",
    "Mesner told Fox 43 that a couple of parents in the Northern York School District approached him to ask about bringing the program to their district.",
    "“The Satanic Temple believes that religion can, and should, be divorced from superstition,” the temple’s website reads.",
    "The After School Satan Club, a product of the Satanic Temple, does not teach religion, according to Mesner.",
    "Rather, it teaches students aged 5-14 about rational and scientific ways of thinking.",
    "Board action on the request to create the club is on the agenda."
