    "You know, so you have Oz on one end, and then you have McCormick on the other, who is a - you know, the CEO or was the CEO of one of the largest hedge funds in the world and, you know, an administration veteran of the Bush administration - very much sort of a traditionalist Republican makeup - you know, Connecticut and, you know, Army veteran and worked for the Bush administration.",
    "It really tells you everything you need to know about the state of the Republican Party in 2022, that in a swing state, in an important key state and one of the most important battlegrounds at the presidential level in the country, the best way to try to become the Republican nominee this year is by becoming as close as you can to Donald Trump.",
    "It shows you Trump's power in this party that these two candidates - one a celebrity like Dr. Oz, who has his own name and reputation, and McCormick, you know, a prominent business leader who has his own political history, as working in the Bush administration - have run so heavily as Trump Republicans and so heavily sought his endorsement.",
    "And so by the end of the race, the disclosure that this box that was pre-checked would withdraw a monthly donation was buried beneath seven lines of other text that had nothing to do with the fact that it was going to take this money out every month, and seven lines of text saying there's going to be a second donation.",
    "He's been writing about the midterms and what they're revealing about divisions within the Republican Party, new dark money groups trying to wield power, Trump's attempts to prove he's a Republican kingmaker, and the ways Trump continues to cash in on his post-presidency, as well as his possible run in 2024.",
    "He's been writing about the midterms and what they're revealing about divisions within the Republican Party - new dark money groups trying to wield power, Trump's attempts to prove he's a Republican kingmaker and the ways Trump continues to cash in on his post-presidency as well as his possible run in 2024.",
    "And, you know, my colleagues have since reported that there was actually a different photo book that had been planned by his White House photographer, that he basically front ran that book and got his own book out because photographs of the White House are public domain from the White House photographer.",
    "And so while somebody might miss that their donation happened a second time the next month or they take a couple of months on their credit card to miss, you don't usually miss that suddenly, your credit card has four contributions in a single month when you intended to only make one.",
    "For all the energy and effort that goes into winning his endorsement - and there are people flying down to Mar-a-Lago for meetings; there are even candidates showing up at Mar-a-Lago at fundraisers for others to sort of wave their hands and shout at Trump and get a picture with him.",
    "But you have a series of others - the Pennsylvania Senate race where he just endorsed, the North Carolina Senate race where Trump just endorsed, even the Idaho governor's race where Trump is backing a Republican challenger to the incumbent governor and a House race in West Virginia.",
    "You've got Chris Christie, a former ally and adviser, the New Jersey governor - the former New Jersey governor who recently was in New Hampshire and gave a speech very critical of Trump and talked about his efforts to reach Trump on January 6 and the unacceptable behavior that day.",
    "He talks about, you know, the election was stolen and if you stole something from Tiffany's and you were caught with the jewels, well, you'd have to give it back, which I kind of love as a frame of reference for what Trump thinks of as things that are getting stolen, you know.",
    "GOLDMACHER: I think it's not a specific policy agenda so much as an attitude and an approach to politics that is culture based and grievance based and trying to do things like build the wall and, you know, focus on these sort of, you know, transgender rights fights.",
    "There's an us-against-them attitude among, chiefly, white voters that Trump had tapped into that isn't going away, that remains the dominant strain of the Republican Party, both the media apparatus that supports the party and the leading party officials themselves.",
    "And the volume of emails from the Senate Republican Committee and the Republican National Committee and the House Republican Committee that invoke Donald Trump's name and at times even masquerade as if they appear like they're coming from Trump is overwhelming.",
    "GROSS: You know, so we've been talking about how the Republican congressman from Alabama, Mo Brooks, says that Trump asked him to say that Biden lost the election and to try to call for a new special election that would help reinstall Trump in the White House.",
    "And so so much of what Trump is demanding of Republicans comes back to, first, buying his lie about the 2020 election and, second, sort of cleansing the party of the people who are critical of him in the aftermath of the election and the riot on January 6.",
    "There's extremely few races where people are openly breaking with his approach to government, who don't want to build Trump's wall, who don't want to do all the things that he said he wants to do, who aren't running sort of these grievance campaigns.",
    "And I think that there's a lot of, you know, private disagreement and, in some cases like Bill Barr and McConnell, public disagreement but an unwillingness to break from somebody who controls such a big part of the loyalty of the Republican base.",
    "And, yeah, so what they've done is the Trump store has, through intermediaries, rented portions of his campaign supporter list, because who's likeliest to buy overpriced Mar-a-Lago Christmas ornaments or, you know, Trump gold whatever, you know?",
    "His brand of the Republican Party is the new brand of the Republican Party, and his own personal power may get diminished in this primary process in certain races, but his approach to politics very much feels like it's already being validated.",
    "You know, Bill Barr, his former attorney general, wrote a very critical book of the former president and then afterwards went on television and said, well, if he's the nominee again in 2024, of course I would support the Republican nominee.",
    "You know, we will get new reports on how much has been spent just in the coming days, but last year alone, just payments to Mar-a-Lago, let alone other Trump properties, I think we're on the order of $650,000 for various candidates.",
    "You've got Senator Tom Cotton, who recently gave a speech and was critical of Trump on a specific issue of crime on a bill that he had signed that Trump had sort of touted that he called the worst mistake of the Trump presidency.",
    "But what's interesting is the idea that Trump was somehow asking an ally in Congress to - even after he was out of office, even after Biden has been sworn in, even after months in the White House, to somehow reverse the election.",
    "I think it's one of the most expensive races in the country and extremely negative - extremely negative ads, basically a bombardment of attacks on Dr. Oz for being a RINO - you know, many attacks on McCormick for his stances.",
    "But sort of the real reason seems to be that Brooks has been struggling in this race, and Trump has been complaining privately for months about Brooks' struggles and saying, I endorse this guy and why isn't he winning yet?",
    "You know, you have his former vice president, Mike Pence, who's been out there making some speeches, who has broken with Trump on a couple of notable issues after years of basically standing by his side through everything.",
    "And I do think that it's worth noting, regardless of how Trump does personally with his endorsement picks, the way that the 2022 primaries are unfolding, Trumpism, the sort of movement that he's led, is definitely winning.",
    "And his endorsement was conditional on the governor not supporting the sitting senator from Alaska, Lisa Murkowski, because Murkowski had supported his removal from office for impeachment for his role in the Capitol riot.",
    "And the reasons he gave - he said basically that Brooks went squishy on this election lie; that he said at one point at a rally, which is true, that voters should move on because Brooks did say that voters should move on.",
    "So there's just a lot of different small things he's doing, as ever the businessman, ever looking for ways to squeeze an extra dollar out of his supporters in his post-presidency, that really just hasn't been done before.",
    "So the same day that Trump rescinded his endorsement of Mo Brooks, Brooks went public and said that Trump had asked him to sort of pursue some way to rescind the 2020 election result and reinstall Trump into power.",
    "You know, the role that Mar-a-Lago is playing in the Republican Party right now as a place that people are being drawn to is totally fascinating and really unlike anything I can recall seeing in American politics.",
    "And you look at the person who has most risen in the post-Trump White House era in the Republican Party, you know, it's Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who has picked the same kind of fights that Trump did.",
    "And you can track the spike pretty clearly through the Internet Archive to how this disclosure box changed at the end of the 2020 race, and how the boxes were pre-checked and then disguised and then made weekly.",
    "GROSS: I'd love to know if you can tell us anything about what the leaders of the Republican Party in Congress really think about Trump and what they say behind the scenes compared to what they say in public.",
    "The biggest money away is this SPAC, this effort to create a social media company called Truth Social that has lured in $1 billion of outside investments and has the potential to be a huge cash cow for Trump.",
    "Now, some went and held an event there even before Trump had endorsed them because, look; one of the best ways to get in front of Donald Trump, you do an event at his property, and he's likelier to swing by.",
    "NYT's Shane Goldmacher says Trump doles out endorsements to Republican candidates to elevate allies, punish enemies and make the 'Big Lie', that the 2020 election was stolen, into a party litmus test.",
    "You have Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who has not sort of ruled out running whether Trump runs or not and who has been second in most of this sort of way-too-early polls of the 2024 field.",
    "And this was something that Trump was obviously very enamored with back at the end of his administration, when it was clear he had lost the White House and didn't want to have lost the White House.",
    "I would circle the month of May to tell us whether that track record's going to stay the same this year because in May, you have a series of races that are going to test Trump's sway in the party.",
    "GROSS: You write that some of Trump's own advisers have warned him that he's making some risky endorsements and that his endorsements, instead of proving he's a kingmaker, might backfire on him.",
    "He's endorsed more than a hundred and twenty candidates to elevate his allies, punish those who've crossed him and turn the lie that the election was stolen into a litmus test for the party.",
    "He's published a coffee table book, a $75 coffee table book self-published through a new company that his son has co-founded with another former aide, selling it directly to his supporters.",
    "And yet Trump, watching his endorsements, knowing that his power is being measured by how successful his candidates he supports are, recently withdrew his endorsement of Brooks altogether.",
    "If I can, I do want to give you one extra little thing that has happened since Trump rescinded that endorsement, which is back to that litmus test question of was the 2020 election stolen?",
    "You know, part of this is sort of a feud between these two people who, you know, obviously were disappointed to have lost the endorsement that had been so central to the Brooks campaign.",
    "GOLDMACHER: So one of Trump's early endorsements in this cycle was of Mo Brooks, who, as you just said, was a leader in the efforts to block the certification of the 2020 election.",
    "What it is, is Trump saying the only way you can be a Trump Republican, which is the dominant share of the Republican Party today, is to echo what he says about the 2020 election.",
    "The governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, has been a Trump critic who sort of created a group in laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run as an anti-Trump Republican.",
    "The primaries will also test how much power Donald Trump holds within the Republican Party and whether the party's new litmus test is endorsing the lie that Trump won in 2020.",
    "You know, one of them was the chief of staff to the sitting senator who's leaving, Richard Shelby, you know, who's sort of a classic Republican, you know, of the old school.",
    "Goldmacher has been reporting on accusations that Trump is now violating campaign finance law by fundraising for his political endeavors without having announced his run.",
    "GROSS: Pennsylvania's an interesting race, which I just want to refer to briefly here, because Trump decided to endorse Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is a famous TV personality.",
    "But in other ways, it was a surprise because Mo Brooks was not known as a powerhouse fundraiser or necessarily a particularly strong statewide candidate in Alabama.",
    "What you get is the ability to, as Dr. Oz did days after Trump endorsed him, put up a television ad saying, I'm the Trump candidate, and I have Trump's endorsement.",
    "You've got, you know, mahogany and dark leather and very expensive drinks and, you know, big, big pictures of him as president and some memorabilia there, you know?",
    "One of the ones that struck me was in the Alaska governor's race where he issued what I can only call a conditional endorsement of the sitting Republican governor.",
    "If you've ever donated money to a political campaign, you know, there's often a box that says, would you like to make this a monthly recurring political donation?",
    "So there's just a number of ways in which he is, you know, tapping almost this direct-to-consumer base and continuing to bring in money in his post-presidency.",
    "He's been doing everything from holding an event last December that looked like a political fundraiser, but in which the money went, in part, directly to him.",
    "My guest, Shane Goldmacher, a national political correspondent for The New York Times, has been writing about Trump's attempts to be a kingmaker in the party.",
    "This is something that, you know, Trump has denied saying specifically, although he has floated this idea publicly of somehow he could come back into power.",
    "The biggest one is the governor's race in Georgia, where since the Republican governor certified the 2020 election - Brian Kemp - Trump has been after him.",
    "We know he's personally popular - almost every poll shows it - but can he defeat candidates who he disagrees with even if he's not the one on the ballot?",
    "And so what happened in the reporting that I did was that there was a huge surge of complaints to credit card companies of fraud, saying, this is wrong.",
    "GROSS: So while we're talking about Trump and money, Trump's 2020 campaign led to millions of dollars that actually had to be refunded to Trump donors.",
    "So Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy - they're going to struggle to come to any real breaks from Donald Trump because their supporters still love him.",
    "The way to raise money from people today is by invoking Trump among Republicans and, frankly, sometimes among the Democrats who get outraged by Trump.",
    "You didn't need to put your own name on the line and risk a loss, especially since you're not going to really do that much for the person you endorse.",
    "And so Mo Brooks basically said that Trump had asked him to pursue ways to do this and that he said that was unconstitutional and he wouldn't do it.",
    "Goldmacher has also been investigating new secret coalitions of wealthy Republicans trying to wield power outside traditional party machinery.",
    "But if you win his endorsement, you basically get a paper statement that he says, you have a complete and total endorsement from Donald Trump.",
    "And two days later, on March 25, there's Mike Durant for the first time flipping his stance and saying, quote, \"I don't think Joe Biden won.\"",
    "And at the end of the day, more than $130 million was refunded by the Trump operation with the party to donors in the course of the campaign.",
    "And so somehow for him, an election that wasn't stolen is akin to jewels taken from Tiffany's, and it should be rightfully returned to him.",
    "Why endorse in some of these races where you're looking at three pro-Trump candidates, when whoever wins is going to be a Trump-y person?",
    "But what Trump has done is said, OK, you're a pro-Trump candidate, you know, running against one of the people who voted to impeach him.",
    "He's been endorsing a lot of candidates to show the power he has to reward or punish, but some of his endorsements have been backfiring.",
    "So in order to not make monthly donations, you had to notice that there was a pre-checked box saying you were making monthly donations.",
    "And so he's sort of, like, cutting his losses early, saying he's going to lose this race, I don't want to be taken down with him.",
    "There's an image of him reaching down and kissing it, which is the close and open to quite a number of television ads this cycle.",
    "So in the intervening months, two other candidates - prominent candidates - got into the race and passed Mo Brooks in the polls.",
    "I think that there has been an increased willingness for Republicans to make their own waves and their own separation from him.",
    "GROSS: I think you say that the candidates who Trump endorses can hold events at Mar-a-Lago, or at least some of them do that.",
    "So 10 cents of every dollar that was raised online in the 2020 campaign by Trump eventually was refunded to his supporters.",
    "And, you know, you can make a strong argument that leaders should lead their supporters where they think they should go.",
    "And, you know, I think each person who does it pushes a little farther and sees those Trump comments snap back at them.",
    "Even though he had described Trump as basically just short of a threat to democracy, he would still support him again.",
    "And there are many people around Trump who think, you know, he's probably overextended himself in this primary season.",
    "And Brooks isn't the only candidate who's said that Trump basically wants something in return for an endorsement.",
    "Let's get back to my interview with Shane Goldmacher, a national political correspondent for The New York Times.",
    "And a lot of these are people just, you know, dipping their toes in the water and seeing how far the ripples go.",
    "GROSS: He's been marketing messages to people on his 2020 campaign email list in order to sell MAGA merchandise.",
    "You know, you say some things - it wasn't decided, but he wouldn't say that Biden was wrongfully the president.",
    "He's also continuing to find new, previously unheard of ways of cashing in on his status as a former president.",
    "Let's get back to my interview with Shane Goldmacher, national political correspondent for The New York Times.",
    "Let's get back to my interview with Shane Goldmacher, national political correspondent for The New York Times.",
    "And instead of paying $10,000 to his political account, it just went to a entity that was paying him directly.",
    "And so people automatically were making those donations monthly if you didn't notice that it was pre-checked.",
    "On Mo Brooks's website today, the central image when you go there is of him speaking at that January 6 rally.",
    "To refresh everybody's memory, he was a big supporter of the falsehood that Trump actually won the election.",
    "There's a whole series of races where we'll have a better sense of Trump's standing in the Republican Party.",
    "There was a recently a terrific interview that Jonathan Swan of Axios did with McConnell in person on stage.",
    "The midterm elections in November will determine which party controls Congress, so there's a lot at stake.",
    "He was one of the originators of this idea that somehow Congress could block the electors being certified.",
    "But Brooks has still said that the election was stolen, and he's still about as pro-Trump as you can be.",
    "GROSS: Meanwhile, after Trump rescinded his endorsement of Mo Brooks, Mo Brooks spoke out against Trump.",
    "I don't know about you or your listeners, but I sign up for as many fundraising email lists as possible.",
    "If you're just joining us, my guest is New York Times national political correspondent Shane Goldmacher.",
    "If you're just joining us, my guest is New York Times national political correspondent Shane Goldmacher.",
    "And I'm thinking here of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and also of Kevin McCarthy in the House.",
    "That said, there isn't a poll that doesn't show Trump as the most popular Republican in the party still.",
    "If you're just joining us, my guest is New York Times national political correspondent Shane Goldmacher.",
    "1 thing he wants is loyalty and the promise to amplify the mistruth that the 2020 election was stolen.",
    "But pretty often in Congress, leaders lead by going where they think the supporters are already going.",
    "And this just dwarfed how much was refunded by the Biden operation, which is a small fraction of that.",
    "GOLDMACHER: I mean, this is the fascinating thing, which is it's not so clear exactly what they get.",
    "And then this is what they did at the end of the race which caused such a spike in refund requests.",
    "And so one of those two candidates who's running, Mike Durant, had basically dodged that question.",
    "And look; there is an entire Republican donor set in Palm Beach that likes to engage in politics.",
    "After we take a short break, we'll listen back to my 1992 interview with comic Gilbert Gottfried.",
    "He sends them a $5,000 check in most cases from his PAC, which again is sitting on $120 million.",
    "You know, he spoke extremely forcefully after January 6 about how unacceptable the behavior was.",
    "You know, there has not been a - you know, the download charts have been dropping and dropping.",
    "In that state, and in some others, he endorsed people who were widely expected to win anyway.",
    "He has personally recruited a challenger and has made it a top priority to try to defeat him.",
    "So if you sign up to give $25, you gave that day, they took out another $25 a few days later.",
    "Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.",
    "And his alliance with Trump and his role in that were absolutely central to his Senate race.",
    "So, yeah, there's definitely some challengers to a potential 2024 campaign of Donald Trump.",
    "Why endorse in some of these races where there are multiple candidates who are pro-Trump?",
    "Trump endorsed him and then withdrew the endorsement, and that really backfired on Trump.",
    "And until Trump rescinded his endorsement, the logo that he used said endorsed by Trump.",
    "I mean, this is something that Trump himself has obsessed over, publicly and privately.",
    "But again, he's endorsed - now I think the number is 130 candidates across the country.",
    "And he asked him about, you know, do you have any moral red lines that you won't cross?",
    "I mean, one of the ones that's most interesting to me - and this is not the big money.",
    "And, you know, I live in Philadelphia, so their ad campaigns have been a little crazy.",
    "GROSS: Shane Goldmacher is a national political correspondent for The New York Times.",
    "What the Trump campaign did is earlier in the year, they began pre-checking the box.",
    "You've got Mike Pompeo, his former secretary of state, who's been traveling in Iowa.",
    "So we've been talking about how Trump wants to be the Republican Party's kingmaker.",
    "This text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future.",
    "They didn't take the money out every month, they started taking it out every week.",
    "But he has his own private store that he launched while he was in the White House.",
    "So you've been writing about ways that Trump is cashing in on his post-presidency.",
    "And it's clear that, you know, for so many of these Republicans, it's party first.",
    "You know, some candidates get a rally in their state, which is extremely valuable.",
    "GROSS: So you said that you think Trumpism is winning out in the Republican Party.",
    "This is something that the McCormick campaign and his allies have hammered Oz for.",
    "And the word RINO is tossed about almost every hour on television in Pennsylvania.",
    "And he's recast himself in this contest as a MAGA Trump Republican, and so has Oz.",
    "These kind of breaks with Trump weren't happening when he was in the White House.",
    "GOLDMACHER: I think Mitch McConnell's been pretty clear where he stands on Trump.",
    "You had to take action (laughter) if you didn't want to make monthly donations?",
    "You know, there are people who write these tell-all books that are anti-Trump.",
    "You get my endorsement, and you get to come to Mar-a-Lago and do a fundraiser.",
    "What else have you heard about what candidates say Trump has wanted in return?",
    "So he has turned Mar-a-Lago into a fundraising hot spot for other candidates.",
    "You know, neither of them fit the sort of mold of a current Trump Republican.",
    "Trump is implying he wants to run again in 2024, but he hasn't yet announced.",
    "They get a statement from Donald Trump and sort of do with it what you will.",
    "And he said that if Trump's the nominee again in 2024, he would support him.",
    "This app that wants to compete with Twitter launched, you know, a month ago.",
    "GROSS: Who would you say is further to the right between McCormick and Oz?",
    "And so in some ways, he was a natural fit for Trump to support for Senate.",
    "(SOUNDBITE OF TAYLOR HASKINS' \"ALBERTO BALSAM\")\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR.",
    "(SOUNDBITE OF AMY RIGBY'S \"PLAYING PITTSBURGH\")\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR.",
    "When Trump endorses a candidate, what does that candidate typically get?",
    "Now, neither of those candidates were particularly Trumpian by heritage.",
    "And he's only had a couple of defeats, and they've been prominent ones.",
    "They added a second box to take out a bonus donation a few days later.",
    "It looks very sort of, you know, what you would imagine, presidential.",
    "And then that money in turn raises money for his political operation.",
    "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSETTE EXPLOSION'S \"DOUCE JOIE\")\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.",
    "So you've got one reality TV guy endorsing another TV guy (laughter).",
    "I don't know that it's a specific quid pro quo in a lot of instances.",
    "Or maybe you get a private meeting with him afterwards or beforehand.",
    "(SOUNDBITE OF HOWARD FISHMAN SONG, \"DIRTY\")\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR.",
    "It's probably the people who signed up for his political email list.",
    "NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.",
    "Although, they have begun selling those sort of signature red caps.",
    "And they added all kinds of extraneous text in each of these boxes.",
    "(LAUGHTER)\nGOLDMACHER: You know, it's a long list - no, truthfully.",
    "There's been a lot of specific things that he's sort of pushed for.",
    "And they both lobbied pretty aggressively for Trump's endorsements.",
    "Before he had his own show on TV, he was a regular on Oprah's show.",
    "There's only been one primary so far in 2022, and it was in Texas.",
    "On the...\nGOLDMACHER: Yes, the Hollywood star on the Walk of Fame.",
    "GOLDMACHER: You know, it's hard to say who's further to the right.",
    "So it was on March 23 that Trump rescinded the Brooks endorsement.",
    "GROSS: Shane Goldmacher, thank you so much for coming on our show.",
    "But the little-money stuff is the stuff that really fascinates me.",
    "The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record.",
    "His Trump store - so it's, like - I don't remember the exact URL.",

    "And so he's extended himself pretty broadly ahead of 2022.",
