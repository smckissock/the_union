    "Oz also featured two guests on his show who claimed that genetically modified foods were cancer-causing (despite repeated safety reports that found no adverse effects).”\nAn editorial in the Journal of the Missouri State Medical Association recounted Oz’s promotion of useless homeopathic remedies, how he has repeatedly hosted shows with psychics who claim to communicate with the dead and spirits and the debunked bizarre belief that each part of the eye’s iris corresponds to a part of the body and that a person’s health can be diagnosed by examining regions of the iris.",
    "Oz” and tells potential voters that “I’ve spent my career in medicine working to empower people to take control of their own lives.” He has actually spent a lot of his career trading off on his medical credentials to do, as the editorial writer in the Journal of the Missouri State Medical Association wrote, “great harm by preventing or delaying proper diagnosis, providing false hope, and encouraging people to waste money on useless treatments.” Promoting useless remedies in a traveling medicine show does not qualify a person to help write our nation’s laws.",

    "But there are several differences: I’m not suddenly claiming I am a resident of Pennsylvania in order to run for the U.S. Senate, I take care of children with cancer and am not trained as a cardiac surgeon, and unlike Oz, no one has shown evidence that I don’t believe in the role of science in underpinning the advice I give my patients.",
    "If it isn’t bad enough that the advice Oz gives you is often wrong, perhaps it should give you pause that this candidate for U.S. Senate dispenses advice without acknowledging the nonsense he is dispensing or his TV show guests’ financial conflicts of interest.",
    "The Journal of Ethics article concludes “Oz is a dangerous rogue…He has told mothers that there were dangerous levels of arsenic in their child’s apple juice (there weren’t) and suggested that green coffee is a “miracle” cure for obesity.",
    "He recommended consulting a health-care professional only 9% of the time — in contrast to another TV advice-dispensing show called “The Doctors” where the show recommends consulting a health-care professional 33% of the time.",
    "Most importantly, the researchers found that there was “believable or somewhat believable” scientific evidence supporting the medical advice dispensed on “The Dr. Oz Show” only 33% of the time.",
    "A group of scientists at Canada’s University of Alberta medical school studied what medical recommendations were made on Oz’s show and whether there was any scientific evidence to support them.",
    "I used to stay with my daughter’s family in Cliffside Park, albeit in the lower rent district than Oz’s mansion, while going back and forth to work in New York.",
    "Forbes magazine has published a list of Oz’s “Wackiest Medical Beliefs.”\nThe banner headline on Oz’s senatorial campaign website proclaims that he is “Dr.",

    "Dr. Oz is a candidate for the United States Senate from Pennsylvania.",
    "It’s a great little town with a wonderful public library.",
