    "In an op-ed published on Wednesday, Rogin noted that Senators “often have conflicts of interest, both business and personal,” but the potential “Senator Doctor Oz” would be unique, if elected, as “a senator who has dual citizenship, served in a foreign military and maintains deep ties to the nation of his birth — one where the leader is notorious for punishing those who cross him.”\nThat Turkish leader is Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Freedom has a very personal reason for objecting to his regime: his own father was jailed by Erdogan for associating with exiled religious leader Fethullah Gulen, who is currently living in Pennsylvania.",
    "I didn’t even donate money to these organizations.”\nRogin characterized that as “not exactly a satisfying answer.” While there is not evidence that Oz is any sort of agent of the Turkish government, and his upcoming required candidate disclosures will shed light on the nature of his business entanglements, concerns remain if he “has business connections that rely on being in the good graces of the government,” as Steven Cook, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, put it.",
    "Television personality Dr. Mehmet Oz stands a very real chance of winning the GOP primary for the Pennsylvania Senate race, writes Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, but Oz’s ties to the Turkish government are drawing criticism, including from NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom.",
    "“So, if Dr. Oz gets into the Senate, it’s like Erdogan’s arm will be in the Senate.”\nThe reasons for concern about Oz’s conflicts of interest, according to Rogin, are beyond his dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship.",
    "“I hadn’t even really gotten engaged in any of this until I decided to run for the Senate,” said Oz, “and I’d never been politically involved in Turkey in any capacity.",
    "In December, National Review compiled a lengthy list of Oz’s business dealings with individuals and organizations viewed as loyal to the Erdogan regime.",
    "It’s been overshadowed by his recent commentary on China’s human rights abuses, but Freedom has been a vocal critic of Erdogan’s government for years.",
    "Oz objected to Freedom’s accusations, telling Rogin that he disagrees with Erdogan on a number of issues and isn’t worried about appeasing him.",
    "It was a driving force behind his decision to pursue American citizenship and adopt “Freedom” as his new last name.",
    "As far as his business activities go, Oz framed them as standard for a prominent Turkish-American.",
    "And whatever Erdogan wants, that’s what Dr. Oz is going to do,” Freedom said to Rogin.",
    "“People need to understand that Dr. Oz is in Erdogan’s pocket."
