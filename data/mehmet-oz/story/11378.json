    "David McCormick, who served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates from 2020-2022, has staked out conservative positions in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race, but conservatives have raised concerns about his corporate record due to his firm's advocacy on transgender issues – from covering transgender surgery for employees to hosting a transgender activist and promoting an employee who identifies as transgender.",
    "GEORGIA GOP CANDIDATE, A RETIRED MARINE COLONEL, URGES MILITARY TO REVERSE TRANSGENDER POLICY AMID UKRAINE WAR\n\"McCormick also personally advocated to get the US Supreme Court to overturn our duly enacted Pennsylvania state marriage laws by filing an amicus brief in the Obergefell case,\" Geer added.",

    "In June 2021, Bridgewater invited Senior Software Engineer Lucas Morales, who identified himself as \"queer,\" to speak about gender identity as part of the firm's \"BPROUD\" affinity group that \"connects and empowers LGBTQ+ employees and their allies to be authentic and inclusive leaders.\"",
    "\"No, as a conservative Dave believes that it is deeply disturbing for liberals like Mehmet Oz to encourage children as young as 8 years old who may be vulnerable and not have the maturity to understand to get transgender surgery and take hormones to block puberty,\" Szymanski said.",
    "CONSERVATIVES DEFEND TEXAS' POLICY INVESTIGATING TRANSGENDER ‘TREATMENTS’ AS CHILD ABUSE AMID COURT BATTLE\nYet McCormick's stance against transgender activism and his pledge to oppose \"wokeness\" seem to clash with his record as CEO at Bridgewater.",
    "\"Woke corporate America has at this point largely embraced transgenderism, so it's sadly unsurprising to see that Bridgewater was no exception,\" Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital.",
    "DR. OZ, NOW A GOP SENATE CANDIDATE, HAD JAZZ JENNINGS, TRANSGENDER PARENTS, TRANSGENDER SURGEON ON HIS SHOW\n\"Dave does not support federal taxpayer dollars going towards transgender surgeries,\" Szymanski told Fox News Digital.",
    "The firm promoted Glennda Tostone, a self-described \"uber-queer\" LGBT activist, to speak on gender identity, claiming that gender is on a spectrum and gender identification is not \"fixed over the course of a person’s life.\"",
    "\"A look at the record of the company led by PA US Senate hopeful David McCormick appears to show an aggressive embrace of the woke agenda, including promotion of transgender ideology and anti-equality ‘DEI’ initiatives.\"",
    "McCormick also signed on to an amicus brief arguing for the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2013, two years before the Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.",
    "(Dr. Oz's campaign addressed criticism of Oz's record in previous comments to Fox News Digital, but it did not explain his stance on medical interventions for children who suffer from gender dysphoria.)",
    "\"To alleviate any lingering potential concerns, we would also encourage him to sign our Big Family Pledge and assure families he will be a reliable ally for them in Washington,\" Schilling concluded.",
    "The candidate pledges that he \"will stand up against the wokeness taking over our schools, big businesses, and the media, and he will fight to ensure every child can live the American Dream too.\"",
    "\"Pennsylvania parents are wondering how that leadership squares with McCormick’s campaign commercials pledging to fight ‘wokeness.’ The words and the record don’t seem to line up.\"",
    "\"We are encouraged that David McCormick has stated his opposition to biological males competing in women's sports and to allowing minors to undergo sex changes,\" Schilling added.",
    "\"Dave has seen first-hand how wokeness and cancel culture in our schools, the military, and business community are turning our country into one we don’t recognize,\" she said.",
    "McCormick, a West Point graduate who served for five years and was deployed to Iraq, currently leads the U.S. Senate Republican primary in Pennsylvania, just ahead of Dr. Oz.",
    "\"He should answer whether he believes this practice is safe and in the best interest of vulnerable children who may not yet have the maturity to understand.\"",
    "During his tenure, Bridgewater offered employees \"fully paid coverage for gender transitions\" as part of an initiative to support \"underrepresented groups.\"",
    "\"As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words,\" Michael Geer, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Family Institute, told Fox News Digital.",
    "When asked about the candidate's corporate record, Szymanski suggested that McCormick's experience as a CEO inspired him to fight \"wokeness.\"",
    "McCormick campaign spokesperson Jess Szymanski laid out the candidate's position on transgender issues in comments to Fox News Digital.",
    "When Fox News Digital asked if McCormick supports male-to-female transgender people competing in sports, Szymanski flatly said, \"No.\"",
    "\"He is running for U.S. Senate to push back on that wokeness and restore the American dream he’s been fortunate enough to live.\"",
    "\"These issues are among the top priorities for pro-family voters, and we applaud McCormick for taking a clear stand on them.\"",
