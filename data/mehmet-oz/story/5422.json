    "Mark Momjian, a well-known lawyer based in Philadelphia and the former chair of the Armenian Center at Columbia University, told NBC News: “No one in this community will ever vote for Dr. Oz … We are convinced that he is part of a denial campaign when it comes to the Armenian genocide.”\nIn an article for The Armenian Weekly, published a few days after Oz announced his Senate run, writer Harut Sassounian compared Oz to Donald Trump, saying neither has a “background in politics” and noting that “the world-at-large suffered enough in the hands of the incompetent celebrity Trump.”\nSassounian also pointed out that even though Oz is a medical doctor, he has continued to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19 and although he’s running in Pennsylvania, he lives in New Jersey.",
    "The reality is that in the same way Trump refuses to acknowledge his affiliation with and support from far-right extremist groups—and has continued to deny his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection, in addition to a million other lies and denials—Oz needs to either come out and say there was a genocide in Armenia, or face consequences from the voters who will surely reject him for failing to do so.",
    "But the most damning incident comes from Hurriyet Daily News, which reported in July 2014 that the Assembly of Turkish American Associations (ATAA), a nonprofit founded in 1979, prepared a “master plan” to “respond to the Armenians’ claims on every front.”\nMeasures included forming “activist committees” to lobby lawmakers, launching social media blitzes, and pressuring news organizations.",
    "Oz, who holds dual Turkish and U.S. citizenship, has seemingly refused to acknowledge that what happened to the Armenian people at the hands of the Turks was in fact genocide, and Armenian Americans are rightfully up in arms about the possibility that a genocide-denier, endorsed by a Big Lie conspiracy theorist, could take office.",
    "Oz’s failure to recognize the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Turks is evident to 1.3 Armenian Americans, most of whom are descendants of the survivors of the genocide … If denial is the final act of genocide, then Turkey’s campaign of disinformation and revisioning history is the ultimate terror.",
