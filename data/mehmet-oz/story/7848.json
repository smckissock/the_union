    "Donald Trump to Newsmax: 'Remember, Nancy Pelosi Is in Charge of Security' on Jan. 6 (Newsmax/YouTube)\nBy Eric Mack | Saturday, 09 April 2022 09:00 PM\nWhile Democrats continue the investigations of Donald Trump and the Jan. 6 \"witch hunt,\" the former president hailed the \"exoneration\" of a Jan. 6 defendant this week and pointed at the real culprit of the storming of the Capitol: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",

    "That looks like a setup from day one, and I think it's making a lot of people look very bad right now.\"",
    "We were putting in because we knew it was going to be very big, because it was about the voter fraud.",
    "We had a request for 10,000 National Guard or soldiers to be there, and she turned them [down].",
