    "“Police organizations said they remain in talks with Biden’s domestic policy adviser, Susan E. Rice, and other senior aides… The parties have reached general agreement on some key issues, including creating national standards for the accreditation of police departments and a decertification registry of officers who commit violations.”\n“But the most contentious questions remain unresolved — such as whether the White House would call for stricter use-of-force standards or changes to qualified legal immunity for officers, which protects them being sued as individuals over alleged misconduct.”\nAbortion legislation, visualized: “Even before this year’s legislative sessions, 12 states already had ‘trigger laws’ on the books,” our colleagues Caroline Kitchener, Kevin Schaul and Daniela Santamariña report.",
    "Josh writes that during the interview, Trump stood by the false claims he made about the 2020 election at the rally on Jan. 6 and defiantly said he “deserved more credit for drawing such a large crowd to the Ellipse — and that he pressed to march on the Capitol with his supporters but was stopped by his security detail the Secret Service.”\nAdvertisement\nTrump declined to say whether he would testify before a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault — “it depends what the request is” — and that he didn’t remember ‘getting very many’ phone calls the day of the siege.",
    "In today’s edition: How President Biden is managing the war in Ukraine … the Senate, as early as today, could confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the next Supreme Court justice ... the Biden White House and DOJ are still walking a tightrope on police reform … but first …\nMore than a year after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob that led to five deaths and hundreds injured, former president Donald Trump appears hardly chastened.",
