    "I think maybe we need to have Republicans controlling the House and the Senate to provide good checks and balances for Biden.”\nBut Thau and Steffee note that the 12 other participants “didn’t view the midterms as a referendum on Democrats.”\n“Instead,” the researchers write, “they were focused on the qualities of the individual candidates, rather than punishing or embracing one party over the other….",

    "Pennsylvania is neither a deep blue state like California or Massachusetts, nor a GOP stronghold like Idaho, Mississippi or South Carolina — although Carville was right when he said that rural parts of Central Pennsylvania vote like they were in Alabama.",

    "No way is that happening.”\nBack in the late 1980s, Democratic strategist James Carville famously described Pennsylvania as Philly in the east, Pittsburgh in the west and Alabama in between — and Pennsylvania is still a lot like that in 2022.",
    "But according to political researchers Rich Thau and Matt Steffee, swing voters in the Keystone State aren’t necessarily in a hurry to vote GOP in 2022 — at least if an online focus group they conducted is any indication.",
    "If Roe v. Wade is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, abortion could be a prominent topic in Pennsylvania’s midterms races — and a liability for anti-choice Republicans among swing voters in the Philly suburbs.",

    "Philadelphia is overwhelmingly Democratic; Pennsylvania’s largest city hasn’t had a Republican mayor since the early 1950s, and Republicans have long been a minority on the Philadelphia City Council.",
    "Democratic strategists, seeing President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings, are worried about Pennsylvania — one of the states that Donald Trump won in 2016’s presidential election and lost in 2020.",
    "Pennsylvania will be one of the most closely watched swing states in the 2022 midterms, from its governor’s race to its U.S. Senate race to an abundance of U.S. House races.",
    "Pennsylvania presently has a two-term Democratic governor, Tom Wolf (who is term-limited), and neither of its two U.S. senators is a progressive.",
    "“Recently, we sat down over Zoom with a group of Pennsylvania swing voters to talk about the midterm elections,” Thau and Steffee explain.",

    "Thau is the president of the research firm Engagious, while Steffee is Engagious’ vice president of research services.",
    "Three-term Sen. Bob Casey, Jr. is a centrist Democrat, while Sen. Pat Toomey is a hard-right Republican.",
    "I couldn’t fathom voting for a Republican that is pro-Trump, that might think like him, act like him.",

    "“Are they being backed by Trump?",
    "And he isn’t seeking reelection.",
    "Inflation is at a 40-year high.",
