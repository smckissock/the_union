    "Weiss said the \"tangibleness\" of school, such as \"sweaty locker rooms, polyester prom dresses, the cool metal of a first-place trophy, the puff of a contraband cigarette,\" completely disappeared.",
    "In a piece published to her sister Bari Weiss' Substack \"Common Sense,\" Weiss talked to several teenagers that spent over a year in isolation because schools were closed due to the pandemic.",
    "\"It’s like a sci-fi show where people went to sleep and woke up two years later, and the world has moved on but they haven’t,\" clinical psychologist Regine Galanti told Weiss.",
    "The negative effect school lockdowns have had on young adults' mental health is a concern that has been shared by both liberals and conservatives.",
