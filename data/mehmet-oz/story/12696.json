    "You have a treatment as well as a preventative strategy and, Brooke, I think that what they were doing was isolating doctors from the process.”\n“By not allowing doctors to customize care, they remove us from the equation,” he added, “like happens in so many other areas in America, now it’s only the federal government telling you with an authoritarian overreach how to live your life.”\nOz is still waiting for another celebrity doctor of note, Dr. Anthony Fauci to accept his invitation for a debate and he took to Twitter over the weekend to all but suggest that President Biden’s top medical adviser, who has been the public face of COVID for the last two years, is too chicken to venture outside of the friendly environment that the mainstream media provides him to answer some real questions.",
    "The aspiring candidate, who is among those seeking the open seat of Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey who will be retiring, made his CPAC debut, joining Dr. Robert Malone -said to be the inventor of the mRNA technology – who has expressed skepticism toward the vaccines along with Dr. Brooke Miller on the panel titled “The Government is Dangerous to Your Health.”\nIn a big reveal that stunned some members of the crowd that gathered in Orlando for the event, Dr. Oz said that he himself has been vaccinated.",
    "Oz continued, “At the time, I just said well, you know it’s been around 70 years, maybe it has a benefit, theoretically it could, so we should at least be examining it – and then President Trump mentioned it,” he said, “and people hated him so much that they began rooting against a solution.”\nIn the spring of 2020, Oz urged Andrew Cuomo who was the governor of New York at the time to lift the state’s ban on the drug after his executive order outlawed doctors from prescribing it.",
    "(Video: You Tube)\nWhen asked for his input on what the government got right with COVID, Dr. Oz said, “Washington got a lot wrong, if I can just add one thought here, if I was to treat a cholesterol problem, I’d give you medication, some of you are actually on medications for cholesterol but if I have a patient who’s on cholesterol medication who has a heart attack, I treat the heart attack, too.",
    "https://t.co/3A763Mz8Pg\n— Dr. Mehmet Oz (@DrOz) February 26, 2022\nIt’s probably pretty safe to say that Fauci isn’t about to go toe-to-toe with Dr. Oz, especially now that Democrats and their media allies have moved on from COVID with the hope that Americans will forget the hellish last two years before they go to the polls in November.",
    "Oz, who has lamented the politicization of the vaccines, also spoke of the hysterical reaction to the well-established antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic treatment in the early stages of the pandemic after former President Donald J. Trump suggested that it could be a helpful option.",
    "SIGN UP HERE\nCelebrity health expert and Republican Senate hopeful Dr. Mehmet Oz was featured at the CPAC conference over the weekend where he participated in a panel discussion on the COVID pandemic and criticized aspects of the government response to the virus and made a big announcement.",
    "When moderator Jason Rantz asked the panel if they had been jabbed, Oz raised his hand and said “I had the shot,” drawing a response of “Noooooo!” from the audience, “it’s poison!” shouted an audience member who was described as a male attendee by the Daily Mail.",
    "“So I learned that there was a medication that most doctors seemed to be confident might help, it was the fog of war, we didn’t know for sure, it was something called hydroxychloroquine,” he said to the audience cheering, according to the Daily Mail.",
