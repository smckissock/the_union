    "I will start and s both of you that same question that is that you both have been involved in preparing the state of the union address is and what I wanted to hear from Joe Biden last night which I knew I would not hear was I'm here to announce tonight that I have had conversations with every big oil producing and I have now authorized all of them to begin the maximum amount of exploration and extraction of energy to once again make America energy independent and also to produce more energy for our allies in Europe.",
    "And I think -- you know, this president need to understand if we want to tip the scale and make really President Putin listen to us, the most effective way to do it is stop financing his war, because, you know, when I met with Germans and I told them -- you know, I'm very disappointed in you and they said, Victoria, you're importing a lot of oil too, and to tell you the truth, I didn't have an answer for that because it was true and it's just disgrace that we're doing that.",
    "And just like Joe's uninspiring State of the Union speech last night, instead of showing real leadership on the world stage, Joe basically read off a wishlish -- wish list of repackaged build-back broke proposals and he offered no plan to curb inflation or no plan to lower gas prices, no plan to secure the border, no plan to reduce violent crime, no plan to counter China and by the way, Taiwan, I would argue keep a close eye on it - probably not going to be that long.",
    "HANNITY: What other options if the world, if the West, Ari Fleischer, is unwilling to implement the one sanction that matters, if they won't do that, I would argued that it renders every other sanction meaningless and negates those sanctions, and I also think there's a lie associated with this because I don't think Vladimir Putin is giving all of that oil to Western Europe and our NATO allies and not getting paid.",
    "If people get out and vote and say, I reject cutting back on oil and gas because I care about the American people's ability to keep warm, and I also care about us endangering other people worldwide that have to depend and I'm not going to take it anymore or I'm going to make sure that our military deters people rather than try to become a school of social justice and equity and diversion and inclusion.",
    "KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As it relates domestically as well as what we need to do in terms of this issue generally, we have, as the president said, reevaluated what we are doing in terms of the strategic oil reserve here in the United States to make sure that it will not have an impact or we can mitigate the impact on the American consumer.",

    "I would argue that Joe Biden's economic and energy policies pushed Europe right into the hands of Vladimir Putin and they became dependent on gas and oil, and I would argue that by America importing energy, oil, 167,000 barrels a day from Russia alone and Europe so dependent on Russia for the lifeblood of their economy, that's a big factor in all of this.",
    "The ones who matter or the minister of defense, Shoygu, director of FSB, Bortnikov, and that national security adviser, Patrushev, they all answer to their own constituencies, particularly Shoygu, who's got a bunch of Russian army officers and their soldiers fighting many of them definitely questioning that leader's orders at this point I would think.",
    "SVIATOSLAV YURASH, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: Well, as far as the full- scale war that is happening, the victory by Ukraine, the reality is that Russians are pushing in all directions but my nation's not united as ever and essentially, this is the reality over the fact that the world sees now the true face of Russia, true face of Putin.",
    "Are there people around Putin high-ranking members of his military, are there advisors around him, people that perhaps have a conscience and a soul, and they see the killing of innocent men, women, and children and taking over a sovereign country that are not in agreement with Putin that would take any action against Putin,.",
    "So that means either Putin and Russia are giving us oil for free, I'd say that's highly unlikely, or Joe Biden and NATO and our allies, they lie to all of us about what these banking sanctions are really all about and they put in a million loopholes so that Putin can still get the money for the oil that they are addicted to.",
    "I mean, a week from today, people will be shocked at what shambles that economy is in, and I think -- you know, and the last problem he has right now is today, especially, we've seen an enormous increase in the in the awareness of Russians that they're involved in a full-scale war and the thousands of Russians are dying.",
    "And so, what Mr. Zelenskyy, and he's become the global hero against his antithesis Putin, who's on the bunker trying to assassinate him, while he's out with hardly any resources to finally challenge him, Putin, and the Chinese are saying, is there going to be someone in Taiwan like that?",
    "Kharkiv the second largest city in Ukraine and also in the south the Russian forces have been indiscriminately shelling different civilian areas and not taking into account anything as they move forward throughout this country and continue their invasion into sovereign Ukraine -- Sean.",
    "You know, the one sanction that would work, the one that would be effective, the one that Joe Biden and NATO refuse to adopt and this by the way raises a whole other set of questions about Russia's banks, and that is that Joe now says we're now -- that Russia's facing steep sanctions.",
    "SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): I think it's to inflict the maximum amount of punishment possible for two reasons first because you got to stop them, but second, because other people that are tempted about becoming like them would take that into account before making a decision to do it.",
    "YURASH: We are -- that's exactly why the last few days, we've been preparing, getting all these sandbags we can get, all the vests we can get all the helmets, we can get all the weapons we get the ammunition from everywhere and trying to prepare most -- well, in that case.",
    "They were upset because I'm here in Pennsylvania where there's natural gas under my feet that could address our domestic issues, could address some of that financial concerns and help their allies in Europe weaned themselves off their dependence on Russian natural gas.",
    "It is insane and frankly unconscionable that Joe Biden cares more about this radical New Green Deal socialist and his friends that he's beholden to than he does about you the American people and of course the national and world security he's now put in jeopardy.",
    "And the reality is that as far as getting ready, for example, in Kyiv, from the siege of Kyiv, people are pushing back with everything they've got, destroying every incursion Russia makes, pushing them back around Kyiv and trying to keep supply lines open.",
    "And I don't know if you remember, Sean, a few years ago, he was on FOX News and he was talking about that, that you don't take me seriously, guys, but I'm not trying to waste my money to defend, I'm going to go on offense and develop to come up to you.",
    "U.S. intelligence analysts warn in the coming days, this city could be surrounded, cut off and all of those civilians, many of them currently hiding underground at this hour amid air raids could be in the targets, in the scopes of these Russian forces.",

    "Now, the question is, there was -- there was one report that said that there might have been Russian intelligence officials that tipped off Zelensky of what their operation was all about and may have even saved his life.",
    "And if they can hang on, it's going to be sending a powerful message to the west to regroup and rethink and get back to our values and people in China as well will say, I don't think I quite want to go into Taiwan now.",
    "It is allowing him to continue his territorial ambitions and then of course, all of Europe, the natural gas comes from Vladimir on top of all of the oil they are importing in that middle of what is going on right now.",
    "But we are starting to see a recalibration in the West, I think, in our 11th hour, Sean, of cultural decline and political inactivity and inertia and I think we will see something happening in Germany in the midterm.",
    "I mean, he is threatening Europe right now and the West in general with nuclear warfare, and thinking, on a hot mic'd in Seoul, South Korea, Barack Obama just dismantled any idea of missile defense in Eastern Europe.",
    "Is there any chance that Western world would have that confidence again to isolate, ostracize, alienate us from all the world financial, cultural levers of power and do to us what they are doing to Russia right now?",
    "I guess my question becomes on top of providing the javelins and stinger missiles, I see this -- these satellite images of this convoy and I'm wondering, why hasn't anybody -- you don't have to take credit for it.",
