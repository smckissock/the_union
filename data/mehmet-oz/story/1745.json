    "https://t.co/cyV1wmjCXt\n— Jacob Rubashkin (@JacobRubashkin) February 11, 2022\nYeah, this is going to leave a mark:\nWhile opponents criticize him for being out of touch with Pennsylvanians and their priorities, Dr. Oz responds by… going to Hollywood to kiss his name on the ground?",
    "https://t.co/Fv0vJW0b8P\n— Spencer Brown (@itsSpencerBrown) February 11, 2022\nAnd it’s already becoming an issue for the Oz campaign:\nOz’s main opponent in the Pennsylvania Republican primary, Dave McCormick, is already lowering the boom, as @HerbNJDC points out.",
    "Pennsylvania Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz took a break from his Senate campaign to travel to Hollywood and literally get down on all fours to kiss his newly awarded star on the Walk of Fame.",
    "Have a watch:\nCurious as to what political advice Dr Oz is getting for his Pennsylvania GOP Senate campaign that would land him in Hollywood today for this.",
    "The ads write themselves:\nOz’s opponents have tried to paint him as an out of touch, out of state Hollywood liberal celebrity.",
    "pic.twitter.com/0ETx7tanOC\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 11, 2022\nDid his opponents trick him into this?",
    "pic.twitter.com/LJqlfKGTKC\n— Jacob Rubashkin (@JacobRubashkin) February 11, 2022\nRecommended Twitchy Video",
    "Now Oz gifts them this footage, which is probably already being cut into attack ads.",
    "(Not to mention the medical advice.)"
