    "Rams Depth Chart\nQB: Matthew Stafford, John Wolford\nRB: Cam Akers, Darrell Henderson Jr.\nWR: Cooper Kupp, Van Jefferson\nWR: Robert Woods, Ben Skowronek\nWR: Allen Robinson, Brandon Powell\nTE: Tyler Higbee, Kendall Blanton\nLT: Joseph Noteboom, Chandler Brewer\nLG: David Edwards, Tremayne Anchrum\nC: Brian Allen, Coleman Shelton\nRG: Bobby Evans, Jamil Demby\nRT: Rob Havenstein, Alaric Jackson\nNotes\nRobinson's signing doesn't necessarily signal the departure of free agent Odell Beckham Jr., who the Rams inked to a one-year deal during the 2021 midseason.",
    "While the official yearly breakdown and structure on Robinson's deal aren't clear at the moment, the Rams will obviously need to perform some salary cap gymnastics to become cap compliant, perhaps through restructures and/or extensions.",
    "A revolving door at quarterback (Mitch Trubisky, Nick Foles, Andy Dalton, Justin Fields) certainly didn't help Robinson, but L.A. is just about as solid as it gets at QB with Matthew Stafford calling shots.",
    "The Los Angeles Rams have agreed to terms on a three-year, $46.5 million contract ($30 million guaranteed) with free-agent wide receiver Allen Robinson, per Tom Pelissero of NFL Network.",
    "OBJ was a big reason why the Rams were able to win this year's Super Bowl, but he is currently recovering from a torn ACL suffered during the title game against the Cincinnati Bengals.",
    "Robinson is coming off a down year (38 catches, 410 yards, one touchdown) in 12 games, but he had a 16-game average of 100 catches and 1,199 yards over the 2019 and 2020 campaigns.",
    "However, per ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Rams would still like to re-sign wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and reportedly have the cap space to get that done.",
    "One could argue that's already the case with Robinson in the mix, but Los Angeles looks well-positioned to dominate yet again.",
    "Salary Cap\nThe Rams were listed as having just $1,482,831 in effective cap space before the Robinson move, per Over the Cap.",
    "Here's a look at how the Rams' salary cap and offensive two-deep depth chart may look with Robinson now in the mix.",
    "If the Rams can get that done, then L.A. undoubtedly has the deepest passing corps in the game on paper.",
    "Expect a big bounce-back year for the former Penn State star as the rich get richer in Los Angeles."
