    "He later added: “You can’t sign everybody back; that’s a fact of this game.”\nAs the Ravens plot a path forward this offseason, trying to plug their many roster holes through the draft and free agency, it’s unclear just how much they’ll be willing to spend on players outside Baltimore.",
    "Offensive tackle\nThe Ravens’ projected starting left tackle, Ronnie Stanley, is coming off his second straight season-ending ankle injury, and DeCosta, at his season-ending news conference, would say only that he was “optimistic” about his rehabilitation.",
    "Sebastian Joseph-Day: The 6-4, 310-pound Joseph-Day isn’t built like an old-school nose tackle, but he lined up over the center or over the center’s shoulder on about half of his snaps as a run defender last season, according to Sports Info Solutions.",
    "Justin Madubuike and Broderick Washington have shown promise as three-technique linemen, lined up over the outside shoulder of the opposing guard, but the Ravens will need to add at least one run-stuffing nose tackle this offseason.",
    "The 6-1, 202-pound Harris, who tied for the league lead in interceptions in 2019 (six), has just one pick over the past two seasons, but at age 30, he can still be an asset in split-safety coverages and on special teams.",

    "What DeCosta wants, he said, are “responsible, good deals that work for the club but also work for the player.” If the Ravens make a splash in free agency next month, it likely won’t be a big one.",

    "Pass protection remained an issue for Price — he allowed two sacks and 24 quarterback pressures — but he was a solid run blocker for the Giants.",

    "Brian Allen: Nagging knee injuries kept Allen from playing a single snap for the Rams in 2020, but he broke out in 2021.",
    "With no dominant edge rushers, first-year coordinator Mike Macdonald will need more from the Ravens’ interior pass rush.",
