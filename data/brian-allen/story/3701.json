    "“What he’s able to do down in, down out, whether it’s in the pass game, run game — he’s an unbelievable competitor.”\nStafford, who had never won a postseason game before beating Arizona in the previous week’s wild-card round, completed 28 of 38 passes without an interception.",
    "But at the end of the day, when you lose a game you lose a game.”\nThe Bucs (14-5), who lost to the Rams for third time in two seasons, were trying to become the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since the Brady-led New England Patriots during the 2004 season.",
    "Kupp, who had nine catches for 183 yards, lost a fumble, and the offense failed to take advantage of Miller sacking Brady to a force a fumble at the Tampa Bay 25 when center Brian Allen snap sailed past Stafford in shotgun formation and recovered by the Bucs.",
    "That included unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh for taunting and Brady, who was flagged while arguing unsuccessfully for what he felt should have been a penalty on the Rams for a hit that appeared to bloody his lip.",

    "“A lot of things didn’t go our way in the second half, but guys kept battling and found a way.”\nEarlier, Stafford found Kupp wide open behind the Bucs secondary on a 70-yard scoring play that put Los Angeles up 17-3 early in the second quarter.",
    "With the Rams on the verge of scoring again in the closing seconds of the second quarter, Cam Akers fumbled at the Tampa Bay 1 and Tampa Bay’s Antoine Winfield recovered to keep the defending champs to keep from falling farther behind.",
    "Stafford, obtained in the offseason in a trade that sent Jared Goff to Detroit, led the Rams downfield after the ensuing kickoff, using completions of 20 and 44 yards to Kupp to set up Gay’s third field goal of the day.",
    "… Punt returner Jaelon Darden left with a possible concussion in the fourth quarter..\nUP NEXT\nRams: Host the NFC championship game against the NFC West-rival 49ers, who have beaten Los Angeles six straight times.",

    "“Nobody was perfect, but we still found a way to win it.”\nThe Rams (14-5) will host next Sunday’s NFC title game against the San Francisco 49ers, aiming for a second trip to the Super Bowl in four seasons.",
    "Brady rallied the Bucs from a 27-3 second-half deficit with help from three of the Rams’ four turnovers, tying the game on Leonard Fournette’s 9-yard run on fourth-and-inches with 42 seconds remaining.",
    "“As for the hit, we did not think that it rose to the level of roughing the passer.”\nThe Rams hurt themselves plenty, too, especially while trying to put the game away in the second half.",
    "Fournette also scored on a 1-yard run for Tampa Bay, which pulled within 27-20 on Brady’s 55-yard TD throw to Mike Evans, who made the catch with Jalen Ramsey in pursuit with 3:20 left.",
    "“We took advantage of them, just couldn’t get the stop at the end.”\nINJURIES\nRams: Played without LT Andrew Whitworth, who was hurt during the wild-card round victory over Arizona.",
    "This time, though, the seven-time Super Bowl champion left too much time on the clock, giving Stafford a chance to create some playoff magic of his own.",
    "Stafford completed nine of his first 12 passes for 176 yards and TDs to Kupp and Kendall Blanton to open a 17-3 lead early in the second quarter.",
    "The Rams built the lead to 27-3 on Stafford’s quarterback sneak, with help along the way from some uncharacteristic mistakes by the Bucs.",
