    "FLORIDA REPUBLICANS CONDEMN 'WOKE' DISNEY, URGE MORE BOYCOTTS BY CONSERVATIVES AGAINST THE 'ACTIVIST MACHINE'\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement that \"Disney's opposition to a common-sense parental rights law exposes its disturbing effort to push the radical left's toxic 'woke' agenda on our country's most vulnerable, our young children.\"",
    "(Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images / Getty Images)\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said: \"While Disney expands its media empire in China, where human rights abuses are ignored, and other anti-gay nations, they caved to pressure by the left and publicly opposed a bill that protects children 4-8 years old from being indoctrinated with woke gender theory.",
    "However, the Florida law doesn't actually contain the word \"gay,\" but states that \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\"",
    "Disney’s actions will do immeasurable harm to our innocent young children by prematurely exposing, indoctrinating and even sexualizing them with ‘gender orientation’ and perverse sexuality,\" Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., said.",
    "\"Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that.\"",
    "The lawmakers' scorn comes after Disney publicly opposed Florida's new parental rights bill, which bars instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.",
    "FIRST ON FOX: A handful of House Republicans are piling on criticism of the Walt Disney Company, accusing the company of prematurely \"exposing, indoctrinating and even sexualizing\" children.",
    "\"Disney needs to get back to wholesome entertainment and remember who their paying audience is – parents of young children, not radical educators, legislators or woke activists,\" Good added.",
    "Corporations like Disney should listen to parents and reject the left's disturbing obsession with sexualizing our children,\" Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., told Fox News Digital.",
    "Disney recently announced it is expanding its media empire into at least ten anti-gay countries, despite its strong stance against Florida's parental rights bills.",
    "Disney this week said it will work to repeal the legislation in Florida because it's dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of the LGBTQ+ community.",
    "There is no trend more disturbing than the left's push to talk to very young children about their sexuality and indoctrinate them with radical gender ideology.",
    "\"Florida’s HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,\" Disney said in a statement.",
    "They're literally taking the position that children should learn about sexual orientation and gender identity before formal education on what sex even is.\"",
    "Those opposed to the legislation, including Disney, have dubbed it the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, saying the law is hurtful to LGBTQ rights and inclusiveness.",
    "(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik / AP Newsroom)\n\"The radical left will stop at nothing to indoctrinate America's children with their woke ideology.",
    "After taking over Disney’s corporate boardroom, their woke agenda is now being strategically woven into our children’s entertainment.",
    "Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., added, \"I applaud Republicans in Florida for taking a stand for parents everywhere.",
    "Parents are horrified by this, and conservatives must protect children from this extreme agenda!\"",
    "\"Far-left radicals are working to infiltrate and control every corner of our lives."
