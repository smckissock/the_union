    "\"The new information is important because it once again underscores that the most dangerous parts of Trump’s election-fraud operation were not the ill-conceived riots but the legal machinations before and on January 6, what I’ve called the “paperwork coup.” Tying the fake electors to the Trump campaign and figures like Giuliani could help rectify the uncomfortable dynamic in which foot soldiers have been prosecuted while kingpins remain unscathed.\"",

    "\"Now, however, the phony electors have become a focus for the House January 6 committee, The Washington Post reports, and the Justice Department is also reviewing the scheme, a top official told CNN.",
    "On the surface, the whole maneuver looks like the province of a few wild-eyed figures: Trump, Eastman, Giuliani, the attorneys Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, Jeffrey Clark, and Mike Lindell.",
    "Among the new revelations is just how closely Trump-campaign officials and the president’s loyal but bumbling consigliere Rudy Giuliani were enmeshed in the ploy,\" he wrote.",
    "As more information trickles out from the House January 6 panel, in court, and in press reports, one rattling revelation is just how many people were in on the coup attempt.",
    "\"As some would have it, former President Donald Trump’s attempt to steal the 2020 election was really no big deal,\" David Graham wrote for The Atlantic.",
    "The plotters might have been grasping at straws, and they might have been ragtag and disorganized, but they were not just a handful of fringe actors.",

    "The list of other participants in the broader effort has continued to grow too.",
    "He noted that 59 phony electors were submitted on behalf of the Trump campaign.",
    "As more information emerges, though, the size of the front grows,\" he wrote.",
    "Six were submitted from Nevada and another ten from Wisconsin.",
    "In Arizona, the fake document was signed by eleven people.",
