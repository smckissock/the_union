NE-Gov: With less than two weeks to go before Nebraska's Republican primary for governor, self-funding businessman Charles Herbster is running a TV ad that takes the remarkable tack of directly attacking one of the eight women who've accused him of sexual battery, state Sen. Julie Slama, claiming her allegations are part of a scheme orchestrated by a rival candidate, Jim Pillen, and termed-out Gov.",
    "After the explosive report came out, Ricketts denied he had anything to do with the allegations against Herbster, telling Politico that it's ridiculous to think that somebody could coordinate eight different people to talk to a reporter about this.? Slama, who has accused Herbster of reaching up her skirt at a 2019 event, has said that the online wedding invitation Herbster is now highlighting was sent to him accidentally, adding that she hadn't even been aware of the mistake until he RSVPed.",
    "The voiceover adds that even after the supposed incident, she kept contacting Herbster? and says Slama even invited Herbster to her destination wedding.? Pillen's attacks, the spot concludes, are built on lies.?\nThe commercial does not, of course, mention any of the allegations leveled against Herbster by not just Slama but also seven other women, all of whom went unnamed out of fear of retaliation when they spoke with the Nebraska Examiner.",
    "NC-Sen: Carolina Senate Fund (R) - pro-Pat McCrory (R), anti-Ted Budd (R), backed by $330,000\nFL-Gov: Charlie Crist (D) - anti-Ron DeSantis (R-inc), backed by $21,000\nAL-05: Casey Wardynski (R)\nAZ-01: Elijah Norton (R)\nCA-03: Scott Jones (R)\nGA-10: Mike Collins (R)\nMT-01: Monica Tranel (D) - anti-Ryan Zinke (R)\nNC-04: Clay Aiken (D)\nNC-13: Wiley Nickel (D)\nPA-12: Summer Lee (D)\nThis is a short blurb about Daily Kos.",
    "Lieberman berates GOP frontrunner Kari Lake for appearing at rallies with neo-Nazi sympathizers and castigates Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs for having been \"found guilty of racial discrimination\" by two federal juries, which Lieberman follows by pledging to focus on solving problems such as fixing schools and creating jobs as he uses a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze.",
    "Hobbs wasn't a defendant in Adams' lawsuit, though she had testified that she had been part of the group that fired Adams after it lost \"trust and confidence\" in her, but her campaign had defended Hobbs in response to the verdict by pointing out that \"the Republican majority chief of staff acted as ... the ultimate decision-maker regarding the termination\" of Adams' employment.",
    "Her attorney responded to the new ad by saying, Charles Herbster is solely responsible for the harm he inflicted against Senator Slama, and he will answer for it in court.?\nHerbster's female narrator begins by charging that Pillen and Ricketts are telling the same sort of lies that, she claims, were also leveled at Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh.",
    "Trump, Politico writes, responded earlier this month to the allegations against Herbster by relay[ing] word that Herbster wasn't fighting back hard enough, backing plans for Herbster to hold a press conference aggressively denying the allegations and pushing back at his adversaries?advice Herbster, much like Kavanaugh, evidently took to heart.",
    "The only other poll we've seen is a March internal for Edwards that found him trailing 52-20.\n? OH-09: State Rep. Craig Riedel and state Sen. Theresa Gavarone are each running new commercials ahead of the Tuesday Republican primary to face longtime Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, though considerably more viewers may see the former's messaging.",
    "While Hobbs had offered an initial apology after the 2019 verdict, she extensively apologized in a statement late last year that acknowledged the discrimination against Adams and conceded that her initial response to last year's verdict was \"unnecessarily defensive\" and \"fell short of taking real accountability.\"",
    "Lieberman's claim against Hobbs references a matter from last decade when Hobbs led Democrats in the state Senate, which involved a Black woman named Talonya Adams who claimed that she was fired from her position as a Senate staffer in 2015 after complaining about being paid less than her white male colleagues.",
    "McGarvey, who has Yarmuth's endorsement, already had a huge resource advantage over his one intra-party rival, state Rep. Attica Scott, even before the PAC came to his aid: McGarvey finished March with a $952,000 to $26,000 cash-on-hand lead, and no outside groups have spent on Scott's behalf yet.",
    "The same judge said back in February that Georgians First could not continue to air ads to help Kemp in his nomination fight against former Sen. David Perdue because Perdue and other non-incumbents cannot create their own leadership committees unless and until they win their primary.",
    "Nebraska Republican Charles Herbster\nThe Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, Stephen Wolf, Daniel Donner, and Carolyn Fiddler, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, James Lambert, David Beard, and Arjun Jaikumar.",

    "Lombardo, unlike some of the other candidates Trump has backed, was arguably already the favorite to advance, as he both ended March with a wide cash-on-hand edge over the rest of the GOP field and posted leads in the only two polls we've seen in months.",
    "? NC-11: GOPAC, a Republican super PAC that says it hasn't endorsed anyone in this race, is out with a survey from Differentiators Data that shows freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn leading state Sen. Chuck Edwards 38-21 in next month's Republican primary.",

    "? NM-Gov: Just two days after state Rep. Rebecca Dow released the first negative ad in the June Republican primary by labeling former TV news meteorologist Mark Ronchetti a \"Never Trumper,\" Ronchetti fired back with his own spot criticizing Dow.",
