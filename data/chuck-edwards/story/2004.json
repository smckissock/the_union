    "This week on The Downballot, cohosts David Beard and David Nir analyzed a bizarre ruling by New York's top court striking down the state's new congressional and state Senate maps; explained why Utah Democrats chose not to endorse a candidate for Senate at their convention last week; discussed the Michigan GOP's decision to back Trump-endorsed Big Lie proponents for state attorney general and secretary of state; and celebrated the results of the French presidential runoff.",

    "In their roles as the top elections official and the top law enforcement official in the state, they have played an important role in making sure that elections are run safely and soundly, whereas the candidates preferred by Trump, obviously believe that the only legitimate elections are ones that Republicans win and would unquestionably use their powers, if elected, to overturn any Democratic electoral victories.",
    "With nine candidates running, Singer said, anything can happen here,? especially given that not all of them have much money or name recognition:\nOne of the worst candidates in the nationand that's saying a lotis state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who, among many other things, tried to help Trump steal the state after the 2020 election, and on Jan. 6, he was filmed passing breach barricades at the Capitol.",
    "At this point, Beard and Nir welcomed Singer onto the show to analyze some sloppy GOP food fights in Senate races in Alabama, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; a pair of primaries in Oregon and Texas where progressive challengers are seeking to oust irritating Democratic moderates; and the first incumbent-vs.-incumbent matchup of the year, thanks to West Virginia losing a House seat.",
    "For that reason, while it may seem unusual, Utah Democrats are purposefully taking a very narrow path to try to get through with McMullin, so that at least the person who hopefully wins will be closer to the centera little bit more pro-democracy, if not a Democrat, somebody who doesn't like Mitch McConnell, who has promised not to vote for Mitch McConnell for majority leader,? Beard said.",
    "Beard added his perspective on the importance of keeping these maps from a politically strategic standpoint, even if they are gerrymandered:\nTo take it from a New York-focused point of a view to a national point of view just for a minute, the end result will probably be less gerrymandered maps for the state of New York, which in a vacuum, one could think, \"Oh, well, that's a good thing.",
    "DePerno, who is the candidate for attorney general, he shot on to the scene in 2020 after the elections, when he claimed that there was election fraud in Antrim County, that's in northern Michigan, a small conservative community, because the vote totals initially showed Joe Biden leading.",
    "The PAC seems to think that this is a good line of attack to argue Fetterman's unelectable, because they've attacked Fetterman for applying for the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, even though Fetterman explicitly said in their questionnaire he's not a socialist.",
    "Gerrymandered maps are bad,\" but when you look at it from a national perspective, what you see is that, in New York, a gerrymandered map to favor Democrats was struck down by a Democratic court, but in Ohio, Republican gerrymandered maps were struck down once by a Republican court.",
    "It's not at all clear to me how on earth lawmakers are supposed to force an evenly-divided partisan body, like the Independent Redistricting Commission, to quote, make more meaningful attempts at compromise,' but that seems to have been the only recourse that was left to them.",
    "On the off chance he wins and we end up with some sort 50-49 Senate plus McMullin, it'll be a really interesting scenario to investigate.?\nNir and Beard moved the conversation to Michigan, where concerning news emerged from Michigan Republicans' convention last weekend.",
    "Turning their attention to Oregon's 5th District, which is held by moderate Democratic Congressman Kurt Schrader, Singer noted that Schrader has annoyed progressives foramong many other thingssaying last year that the idea of impeaching Donald Trump was like a lynching.",
    "Trump did, in fact, win by a big margin in the county, but of course, none of that ever matters in the MAGA world, so DePerno has continued to press his claims that election fraudwhich again didn't existwound up causing Trump to lose the state of Michigan to Joe Biden.",
    "Macron won with 59% of the vote to Le Pen's 41%, a fairly significant defeat, a little bit larger than the polls were showing just before the electionwhich had been about 10 pointsbut was a significant narrowing from their 2017 race, which Macron won 66% to 33%.",
    "He's had an advantage in every poll we've seen against Congressman Conor Lamb, who won a very closely-watched special election in western Pennsylvania in 2018, and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who would be the first Black and gay senator to serve, ever.",
    "Schrader's one and only Democratic primary opponent in the seat, which takes up some of the Portland suburbs in Central Oregon, is Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who would be the state's first LGBTQ member of Congress and is running to Schrader's left.",
    "It's still called the IRC.?\nFurthermore, the IRC failed to produce actual new maps, and the constitution says that new maps have to come from the IRC and those maps have to be passed on a bipartisan basiscreating and impasse on the panel.",
    "Golob is the former executive of a state-owned energy company who took over, in a friendly way, the country's very newly-constituted Green Party, renamed it the Freedom Movement, and led it to victory all in the course of about a year.",
    "There was a real increase for Le Pen and her vote five years later, which Beard thinks is concerning:\nWe also saw that turnout was 72% out of registered voters, which was a low for French presidential runoffs dating back to 1969.",
    "Though primaries started back in March with Texas, the 2022 election cycle really gets underway in May.The coming month brings primary elections in 13 different states, and that includes Texas, which is holding runoffs.",
    "Garcia faces Sandra Whitten, who lost a very little-noticed campaign in 2020 to Cuellar  This seat in the Laredo area is a long-time Democratic stronghold, but Biden won it only 53 to 46 in 2020, so it could be in play.",
    "One of those candidates is Economic Development Advisor Carrick Flynn, who has benefited from over $7 million from Protect Our Future PAC, which is a group that's funded by cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried.",
    "Singer elaborated that Cawthorn might have essentially shot himself in the foot by getting greedy and switching districts:\n[Cawthorn's] greatest liability might be [that he] essentially tried to switch districts.",
    "One of them is he does not really take part in competitive Democratic primaries that often, so it's pretty notable he's weighing in here, even for someone who's tried to obstruct his agenda,? Singer pointed out.",
    "There's some fear that Walker could cost Budd some much-needed votes, but while McCrory went into the year with leads in even a Budd internal poll, the recent numbers we've seen have shown Budd well ahead.",
    "Even if a large majority of voters want Cawthorne gone, if he clears 30% and gets more votes than anyone else, he's renominated, which is pretty good, considering how red this district is,? he added.",
    "In the next district over, Oregon's 6th District in the Willamette Valley, there is a large field of candidates, but only two of the nine Democratic candidates have really gotten a lot of attention.",
    "On March 1, conservative Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar led his progressive Democratic primary opponent, Jessica Cisneros, just 49 to 47%very close, just below what Cuellar needed to avert a runoff.",
    "He's run ads that show Budd saying nice things about Putin and commending him as pretty smart when he invaded Ukraine, but so far that doesn't seem to be moving the needle the way he needs it to.",
    "The Court of Appeals said it probably has to take place in August, but there's a whole other round of litigation that's going to have to be resolved over the maps drawn up by this special master.",
    "The two congressmen, while having voted the same way most the time, have diverged on two very important issues recently: McKinley supported creating a Jan. 6 commission; Mooney very much didn't.",
    "The 2nd congressional district in the northern part of West Virginia will bear witness to the first incumbent-versus-incumbent primary of the whole cycle between Alex Mooney and David McKinley.",
    "Donald Trump is endorsing wealthy businessman Charles Herbster, who was at the Jan. 6 rally that came right before the attack on the Capitol, although Herbster says he wasn't there for that.",
    "There, the current Democratic incumbent is term limited, and Democrats have rallied around state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, but the GOP primary is once again shaping up to be very messy.",
    "With three major candidates, or two and a half if you count Brooks, and a bunch of pretty minor contenders on the ballot, it's very unlikely anyone's going to win the first round outright.",
    "To try to break Fetterman's lead, a pro-Lamb super PAC has spent heavily on ads thatrelying on a since-corrected media reportfalsely claims that Fetterman was a self-described socialist.",
    "Mandel has the support of the Club for Growth, a really deep-pocketed conservative organization that's been particularly aggressive about going after Vance for what he said about Trump.",
    "The race took a really unexpected turn two weeks ago when eight women, including a sitting Republican state senator, accused Herbster of groping them and other forms of sexual assault.",
    "Singer opened by sharing what he thought were upcoming main events, including the Ohio Republic Senate primary this upcoming Tuesday for an open seat in the wake of Republican Sen.",
    "Additionally, Democrat's House Majority PAC, which exists to keep Democrats in the majority and generally do not intervene in primaries; yet they've spent $1 million to help Flynn.",
    "Cawthorne, he gets a little greedy and says, I'm going to run for an even more Republican seat that I barely represent in the Charlotte area.'\nNo one's quite sure why he did that.",
    "Nir then highlighted what is happening in Georgia, home to a whole host of compelling primaries, the top of the ticket of which is the GOP battle in the Georgia governor's race.",
    "Might have just been to increase his statewide name recognition, might have been just to show what a big dog he was, but it really backfired, because that map no longer exists.",
    "Singer recalled an interesting turn in this race back in January, when Federal investigators raided Cuellar's home and campaign office, allegedly over his ties to Azerbaijan.",
    "Singer thinks things are clearer on the Democratic side, and that the GOP race has been an expensive mess?:\nOn the Democratic side  We have three major candidates, Lt. Gov.",
    "The highlight, of course, is TX-28, which we've covered extensively here already, but what has been going on since the first round down there in south Texas?? Beard asked.",
    "He's been focusing pretty much entirely on how he's Trump's candidate, and he's been proclaiming the Big Lie at every chance he gets ... but it doesn't seem to be working.",
    "Nir asked Singer to provide a rundown of the situation, and Singer had this to say:\nNorth Carolina's Senate seat is open because Republican Sen. Richard Burr is retiring.",
    "Regardless of who wins, Democrats will be nominating former state Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley, who doesn't really face any opposition in her primary,? Nir said.",
    "The court based its ruling on an amendment to the state constitution that voters approved in 2014 that created a body called the Independent Redistricting Commission.",
    "This is a key part of their strategy, Nir noted:\nThat's particularly crucial, given that Michigan will, almost certainly once again, be a major swing state in 2024.",
    "Moving on to Nebraska, where the winner of the Republican primary is probably going to go on to win the general election, Singer pointed out three major candidates.",
    "This is a reflection of a broader pattern we are seeing in other states, where really extremist candidates, Big Lie supporters, are running for secretary of state.",
    "Delegates to Utah's state Democratic Convention voted on Saturday not to run a candidate, an unusual move that one would not expect a state party convention to do.",
    "This, however, throws New York's politics into turmoil, because the filing deadline passed several weeks ago, and in New York, filing is not just a mere formality.",
    "You'll have no Democratic candidate, but you'll have it at least publicly known that the Democratic Party is backing McMullin's Independent run,? Beard explained.",
    "Nir then informed listeners that Pennsylvania is a state that does not use runoffs, so whoever wins this primary could do so with a very small share of the vote.",
    "Then there's Army veteran Mike Durant, who was held prisoner in Somalia for 11 days in 1993 in the incident that was dramatized in the movie Black Hawk Down.",
    "In closing, he noted that things are far from determined in this race:\nWhile Cuellar has long had a money advantageand still doesit has narrowed quite a bit.",
    "The GOP went with Matthew DePerno in the race against Attorney General Dana Nessel and Kristina Karamo in the race against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.",
    "It's a similar system, where all of the races go to runoffs between the top two candidates a couple of weeks later, just like the presidential system was.",
    "Last year, the Republican legislature adopted a congressional map, put most of Cawthorne's existing seat in a different western North Carolina district.",
    "Cisneros is more focused on abortion rights for this round: she's attacked Cuellar for siding with Texas Republicans to restrict the right to choose.",
    "The other candidate who's got plenty of attention here is state Rep. Andrea Salinas, who would be the first Latina to represent Oregon in Congress.",
    "Trump recently decided to endorse TV personality Mehmet Oz, as in Dr. Oz, who has very weak ties to the state; he didn't even vote there in 2020.",
    "There was a recent poll that showed a very close three-way race, with Lindstrom for the first time with a small leadbut very little polling here.",
    "The trio discussed yet another primary in North Carolina for a House race in the far western part of the state, which involves Madison Cawthorn.",
    "He lost his election in eastern Pennsylvania to the Delaware County Council back in 2017, but he's still a big presence, thanks to his wealth.",
    "Daily Kos Elections editor Jeff Singer joined for the second half of the show to talk about the huge slate of primaries coming up next month.",
    "I mean, it's safe to assume these were primarily left-wing voters who were unhappy with the options of a centrist and a far-right candidate.",
    "What you'll have as a result is Republican Sen.incumbentMike Lee running on the Republican ticket and you'll have Independent Evan McMullin.",
    "Nir explained that the process ended up completely jumbled because the commission could not agree on any maps, leaving New York with none.",
    "There was much more of a sense that a lot of people voted for him purely to keep Le Pen out, rather than out of real energy on his behalf.",
    "The Republicans also have a race to watch here, but the GOP establishment's going all in for a former Ted Cruz staffer named Cassy Garcia.",
    "The trio swung back to the eastern portion of the United States to hit the third major state that has a primary on May 17: Pennsylvania.",
    "Vance, like plenty of Republicans in 2016, was a vociferous Trump critic, who at one point mused he might even vote for Hillary Clinton.",
    "In conservative Utah, Democrats seem to have accepted the idea that they have little to no chance of unseating Republican Sen. Mike Lee.",
    "In both cases, two Trump-endorsed candidates who are Big Lie proponents defeated more traditional choices backed by the establishment.",
    "Most incumbents would be quite okay with that, but Cawthorne's constituents, they felt that he just tried to straight-up abandon them.",
    "Pat McCroryyou might remember him from 2016, when he narrowly lost reelection over the backlash over the transphobic bathroom bill.",
    "He's backed workplace protections for LGBTQ people, and he voted to override Ricketts' video on a gas tax and death penalty repeal.",
    "McKinley was one of the few Republicans who voted for the Biden administration's infrastructure bill; Mooney very much did not.",
    "Barletta, back in the early 2000s, was this virulent anti-immigration crusader when he was mayor of the small town of Hazleton.",
    "Singer thinks that it very well could:\nBrian Kemp, the governorhe rode to victory in the 2018 primary after Trump endorsed him.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "Singer says it is a cause for concern, and provided this overview of the situation:\nThat's caused a lot of consternation here.",
    "The GOP primary for North Carolina's Senate seat, which is another open seat race, has also become another truly nasty affair.",
    "Walker has trailed very badly in the polls, but kept running, even though Trump tried to convince him to run for a House seat.",
    "The Republican legislature was allowed to do a second round of gerrymandering and just pass it through, at least through 2022.",
    "More than three million voters went to the polls and cast a blank ballot in protest of the two candidates who were available.",
    "He since reinvented himself as a born-again MAGA conservative, but he's still taking plenty of flack for his past statements.",
    "Slovenia also recently held elections to determine whether right-wing Prime Minister Janez Jansa would receive another term.",
    "Why would they get involved in a primary for a seat that, since Biden won at 55 to 42, really shouldn't be that competitive?",
    "Right now, New York's maps are a total black hole, and there is just no predicting what's going to come out the other side.",
    "We're waiting to see if Trump's going to take sides, now that he's abandoned Brooks, or if he just lets this one play out.",
    "We are primarily accountable to readers like you because donations from readers like you are our biggest source of income.",
    "Every poll we've seen has shown Kemp either at or very close to the majority he'd need to avoid a runoff also on June 21.",
    "Unsurprisingly, that's not shaken Trump's confidence in him in the least, but we'll see if that affects things on May 10.",
    "Cawthorne's main opponent right now appears to be state Sen. Chuck Edwards, who has the endorsement of Sen. Thom Tillis.",
    "Oz has been self-funding much of his bid, but so has former hedge fund manager David McCormick and his allied super PAC.",
    "In France, the presidential runoff took place between centrists Emmanuel Macron and far-right challenger Marine Le Pen.",
    "They allowed the Ohio legislature to go back and draw another gerrymandered map and now those maps are being litigated.",
    "The expectation is that the primary will go ahead and the general will go ahead with these current gerrymandered maps.",
    "As Nir put it:\nNo one has any idea what the next set of maps will look like, but those also will be subject to appeal.",
    "No corroboration on this claim from the FBI or Department of Justice, but it hasn't emerged in campaign ads this time.",
    "The map that was adopted by the state Supreme Court no longer gave Cawthorne any real option, except to run at home.",
    "Maybe it was the Club for Growth, which has been spending very heavily here on Budd's behalf, making the difference.",
    "A dissenter said that was really nonsense and said that this view would leave the legislature hostage to the IRC.",
    "Maybe the polls are wrong, but if they're not, it's looking like Trump's going to take a very big black eye here.",
    "This one might've gotten more ink than any other, but it seems like it's possibly about to fizzle?? he suggested.",
    "Here's how far Republican politics has gone to the right: McCrory, if anything, is the less far-right candidate.",
    "Pete Ricketts, who hails from one of the most influential donor families in the Republican Party, is termed out.",
    "Mastriano also recently addressed a QAnon-aligned group, although he claims not to have anything to do with it.",
    "Trump's not so fond of him anymore, especially after Kemp refused to help him steal the state two years later.",
    "Those maps unquestionably favored Democrats, but this was the process that lawmakers believe was left to them.",
    "If it is a rematch between Kemp and Abrams, that will certainly be a blockbuster in November,? Beard added.",
    "You have former Congressman Lou Barletta, who lost the 2018 Senate race really badly to Democrat Bob Casey.",
    "So far, none of them have benefited from anything like the endorsements the other two have, but we'll see.",
    "Cisneros is not getting outgunned the way she did back in 2020, when she narrowly lost in the first round.",
    "As he explained,\nRicketts is backing Jim Pillen, who is a University of Nebraska regent and a pig farmer.",
    "In North Carolina, though, a second round happens only if no candidate takes more than 30% of the vote.",
    "Cawthorn how has seven opponents, and with North Carolina's runoff rules, that could bode well for him.",
    "With no fewer than five candidates running, Singer highlighted the major candidates:\nIt's been a mess.",
    "There was a lot of nasty sniping between the majority and the dissenters in the footnotes,? Nir added.",
    "Lacking a timetable, all the commission said was that the maps should be passed with \"all due haste.\"",
    "As West Virginia is a very red state, whoever wins is almost certainly going to prevail in November.",
    "We don't have any recent polls, but it's really been this demolition derby between Oz and McCormick.",
    "You also have wealthy businessman Dave White, who has used his resources to outspend everyone else.",
    "We'll see if that moves the needle, but even Edwards knows he's starting well behind,? Singer said.",
    "In many states, Singer explained, if you take less than a majority of the vote, you're in a runoff.",
    "Lastly, in Europe, two sets of elections have yielded positive results, as Nir and Beard explained.",
    "The difference here, obviously, is that Macron is definitely less popular now than he was in 2017.",
    "This was a convention to choose their nominees for state attorney general and secretary of state.",
    "We'll see if that does him any damage, but so far it doesn't seem to be, at least in the primary.",
    "Nir raised the issue of another demolition derby going on in the governor's race in Pennsylvania.",
    "You also have former Congressman Mark Walker, who has some connections with the religious right.",
    "Edwards even released a poll just last month that gave Cawthorne this huge 32 to 20 advantage.",
    "It doesn't look like Flynn is such a great candidate, that the group needs to intervene here.",
    "Whoever wins this one is going to take on Stacey Abrams, who was the 2018 Democratic nominee.",
    "Trump's gone all in for former Sen. David Perdue, who lost last year's runoff very narrowly.",
    "We'll see if that changes, but so far Cisneros is focusing on abortion rights,? Singer said.",
    "Cuellar's attorney recently said the congressman is not a target in a federal investigation.",
    "He's benefited from recent footage of Oz kissing his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
    "Moving on to May 24, we've got three states holding a primary, along with the Texas runoffs.",
    "That's essentially what the court seems to be okay withthe majority; this was a 4-3 opinion.",
    "That could be an even bigger liability than all the coke and orgy allegations in the world.",
    "Then, you have a third major candidate: state Sen. Brett Lindstrom, who is more moderate.",
    "The trio wrapped up the show in Texas, which is holding runoffs from their March primary.",
    "The problem for Perdue, it seems, is that Kemp still is liked by a majority of the base.",
    "Edwards has been running ads, saying, \"I'm not some vapid celebrity, unlike my opponent.",
    "What they decided instead is to back conservative Independent Evan McMullin's campaign.",
    "That's because Ted Budd, who is Trump and the Club for Growth's candidate, is also in.",
    "John Fetterman, who's the tattooed, six-foot-nine candidate who has this big fan base.",
    "New York has to have new maps, and so we are going to pass new maps,\" which they did.",
    "You can listen below, or subscribe to The Downballot wherever you listen to podcasts.",
    "If 31% of the voters here want a vapid celebrity, that's pretty good for Cawthorne.\"",
    "Here, there are competitive Democratic and Republican primaries in the Senate race.",
    "Kate Brown, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has also spent $1 million on her.",
    "This one will probably go to a second round almost certainly [in a June 21 runoff].",
    "That's not just journalists, but fact-checkers, editors, and administrative staff.",
    "Let's start off in Alabama, where the Republican Senate primary is taking place.",
    "That's far less than what Flynn has benefited from, but it's still quite a lot.",
    "Alabama's another state where you do need to win a majority to avoid a runoff.",
    "He has said he was a Trump conservative before there were Trump conservatives.",
    "As a reminder, you can reach our hosts by email at thedownballot@dailykos.com.",
    "It'll be interesting to see how that plays out in the legislative elections.",
    "Jim Justice; Mooney has Donald Trump and the Club for Growth in his corner.",
    "The Club for Growth is still on his side ... Brooks really is in bad shape.",
    "The Downballot comes out every Thursday everywhere you listen to podcasts.",
    "He apologized and voted to impeach Trump anyway, but the damage was done.",
    "And big names are getting involved: Joe Biden recently endorsed Schrader.",
    "He was defeated by a political newcomer, Robert Golob's Freedom Movement.",
    "We don't have corporate backers that are only in it for the bottom line.",
    "McLeod-Skinner argues that Schrader is dependent on special interests.",
    "A Thom Tillis-aligned super PAC has also been running ads against him.",
    "If he does win, that'll at least be interesting to watch,? Beard said.",
    "He was the Republican nominee for the other Ohio Senate seat in 2012.",
    "Its members are mostly appointed by politicians in the legislature.",
    "Cuellar's pretty much stuck with his strategy from the first round.",
    "Please send in any questions you may have for next week's mailbag.",
    "This really bizarre? outcome has left Democrats extremely unhappy.",
    "It's important:\n Media outlets shed 28,637 jobs last year alone.",
    "She's the former chief of staff to retiring Sen. Richard Shelby.",
    "Mastriano has plenty of competition, though, on the far-right.",
    "There's Katie Britt, who ran the state's Chamber of Commerce.",
    "The GOP race, on the other hand, is such an expensive mess.",
    "Singer offered this update:\nBrooks is still limping along.",
    "Vance, who is best known as the writer of Hillbilly Elegy.",
    "That's where Trump withdrew his endorsement of Mo Brooks.",
    "The polls show Budd's really taking control of the race.",
    "You can also find a transcript for this week right here.",
    "How do you see both of these going, Singer?? Nir asked.",
    "He's using his money to finance super PACs to help her.",
    "He's fervently conservative on pretty much everything.",
    "We have no idea who  Vance is going to end up beating.",
    "Maybe people are just tired of seeing McCrory's face.",
    "It's certain that New York's primary will be delayed.",
    "McCormick is portraying Oz as this vapid celebrity.",

    "They'd been running ads, attacking one another.",
    "There are two other major candidates to watch.",
    "He's argued Cisneros is weak on public safety.",
    "Next, the pair turned to the Utah Senate race.",
    "Thus, the state legislature said, \"Well, okay.",
    "Singer thinks that there is a lot to see here.",
    "Maybe it was Trump pushing Budd extra hard.",
    "As Nir put it, It's not independent at all.",
