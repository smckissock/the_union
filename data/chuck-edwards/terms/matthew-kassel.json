    "sentence": "Sen. Thom Tillis announced Wednesday that he was endorsing state Sen. <span class='selected-term'>Chuck Edwards</span>' campaign to defeat freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn in the May 17 Republican primary for North Carolina's 11th District, saying the next day that the incumbent has fallen well short of the most basic standards Western North Carolina expects from their representatives.?\nTillis threw in an unsubtle reference to Cawthorn's previous attempt to leave his constituents behind to run for an even more conservative district in the Charlotte area that he barely represented before a new court-drawn map foreclosed that possibility, antics that likely did him far more damage at home than his litany of embarrassing behavior.",
