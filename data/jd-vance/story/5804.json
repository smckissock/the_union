    "But it's also the first big win for billionaire Peter Thiel and the MAGA smart set who would like to see a GOP that is less libertarian in economics, less neoconservative in foreign policy, and as socially conservative as ever.",
    "But the end result is the same: a self-styled America First candidate who is not beholden to the Republican establishment in a must-win race for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.",

    "Trump needs Vance to keep winning because some of his endorsements seem less likely to pan out.",
    "The ex-president was a difference-maker in the contest, even though Vance's \"Are you a racist?\"",
    "He also had to compete with Mandel's lower-brow-than-Hillbilly-Elegy appeal to the base.",
