    "Vance (celebrated author and Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Ohio) who recently declared that he “doesn’t really care what happens to Ukraine.”\nIf the 1985 version of Marty McFly transported to 2022, it would be impossible to explain to him why so many conservative Republicans are willing to look the other way on Russia invading a sovereign nation, while they simultaneously blast Canada for imposing consequences on protesters blocking traffic.",
    "As The New York Times writes, Trudeau “invoked an emergency measure that gave the police the ability to seize the protesters’ vehicles and allowed banks to freeze their accounts.” Freezing people’s bank accounts and doxing donors (which was done via a leak, not by the government) raises legitimate concerns about asset seizures and the implementation of a sort of “social credit system,” whereby unpopular political opinions are suppressed.",
    "“We cannot and will not allow illegal and dangerous activities to continue,” Trudeau said in a speech, citing “serious challenges to law enforcement’s ability to effectively enforce the law.” In a different world, this would be called “leadership,” and Trudeau would be hailed by conservatives for demonstrating “toughness” and for not letting lawlessness prevail.",
    "If you find someone willing to defend Vladimir Putin for threatening to invade and kill his neighbors, while simultaneously calling Justin Trudeau a “dictator” for shutting down a lawless protest after three weeks, you have found someone who either is intellectually dishonest or has a warped sense of reality.",
    "This argument is obviously a slippery-slope prediction, but those who care about preserving liberty must be vigilant in calling out attempts to limit free expression and stifle diverse political viewpoints—which, of course, is vastly different from punishing lawless acts like shutting down traffic.",
    "Carlson isn’t outraged over what is happening to Ukraine, but found time last week to bash “strongman” Trudeau as “the dictator of Canada,” while saying that “Canada canceled democracy…”\nThere’s also Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who says Trudeau has gone “full dictator.” And J.D.",
    "In Russia, Putin is breaking the rule of law and the people have no recourse to stop his actions.”\nI’m reminded of the “blame America first” phenomenon that was once a feature of the “useful idiots” and “dupes” on the left—but has become democratized, so to speak.",
    "My friend Jeff Mayhugh sums it up perfectly: “In Canada, Trudeau is enforcing the rule of law and if the people of his country do not like the laws they can organize and lawfully remove him from power.",
    "The two dominant news stories right now (Russia menacing Ukraine and the Canadian truckers protest) provide us with a unique opportunity to compare and contrast people’s comments.",
    "“What the Canadian government is doing is a preview of what the US government in the future will likely [do to] dissenters,” writes the conservative writer Rod Dreher.",
    "He has fundamentally declared himself dictator and is waging war on innocent Canadian protesters and those who have supported them financially.” Dictator?",
    "On the other hand, I do understand why Americans might worry more about creeping authoritarian tendencies closer to home than those occurring abroad.",
    "If you want to understand someone’s values or worldview, take a look at who (and what) provokes outrage and who (and what) evokes sympathy.",
    "Now, as a conservative, I’ve never been a big fan of Trudeau, and his critics do have one point about what he did that I find persuasive.",
    "He took action to restore law and order after three weeks of truckers blocking traffic and generally disturbing the peace.",
    "This concern makes sense, and not just for those who espouse an “American First” worldview, with all that entails.",
    "The penchant to beat up the West, while giving the legitimate authoritarians a pass, is problematic and unhelpful.",
    "That’s because some of the most prominent voices on the right today view Vladimir Putin as a misunderstood victim.",
    "Or consider Fox News host Tucker Carlson, my friend (though we disagree profoundly on politics) and former boss.",
    "Consider the message of right-wing commentator Candace Owens, who recently tweeted: “STOP talking about Russia.",
    "It’s a truly twisted and perverse perception of a dangerous world, and the scary thing is, it’s catching on.",
    "The cognitive dissonance inherent in much of the American right can make such an examination problematic.",
    "Regardless, in the pantheon of civil liberties violations, Trudeau is a piker when compared with Putin.",
    "At least, that would be the case if the protesters were hippies or Black Lives Matter protesters.",
    "But they don’t want to, since their world knowledge is fed to them via Russian media propaganda.",
    "The American right is wrong to tear into Justin Trudeau while giving Vladimir Putin a free pass.",
    "And don’t forget the little matter of 100,000 of his troops massed on the Ukrainian border.",
    "Send American troops to Canada to deal with the tyrannical reign of Justin Trudeau Castro.",
    "Meanwhile, they cast Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as an authoritarian strongman.",
    "(This only makes sense if you also believe the Jan. 6 rioters were harmless tourists.)",
    "The American right is getting in the habit of calling evil good and good evil.",
    "To be clear, Putin is a former KGB agent and an actual authoritarian.",
    "Russian citizens probably couldn’t get rid of him if they wanted to.",
    "If you thought the gaslighting would end with Trump, you were wrong.",
    "Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau is the elected leader of a free nation.",
    "To be sure, Canada isn’t the U.S., but they’re pretty darn close.",
    "Heck, you probably wouldn't even need to go as far back as 1985.",
    "However, we’re still comparing apples to oranges.",
    "He literally kills and imprisons his critics.",
    "Innocent protesters?",
    "How about 2005?",
    "(Hardly.)"
