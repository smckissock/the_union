    "| Kenneth Ferriera/Lincoln Journal Star via AP, File\nBy Marissa Martinez\n 05/10/2022 11:48 PM EDT\nAll 22 of Donald Trumps endorsed candidates in Indiana and Ohio came away with the Republican nomination last week.",
    "While his May 3 win-loss record looked impressive on paper, it was artificially inflated  the former president backed lots of incumbents who had no opposition and counted them as victories.",
    "At a May 1 rally in Nebraska, Trump even took shots at Bacon, and asked the attendees to vote for the congressmans cash-strapped GOP challenger, Steve Kuehl.",
    "He backed GOP Rep. Alex Mooney over Rep. David McKinley in West Virginias 2nd District and Charles Herbster for governor in a messy contest in Nebraska.",
    "In other words, while Trump wanted Kuehl to win, he wasnt willing to risk tarnishing his record by endorsing a candidate who seemed likely to lose.",
    "He voted to overturn 2020 electoral votes, against creating the independent Jan. 6 commission and against enacting Bidens infrastructure plan.",
    "Trump is no fan of Bacon, who supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill and has said Trump bore some responsibility for Jan. 6.",
    "Smith, who represents a huge, rural district that covers the western part of the state, voted to overturn 2020 electoral votes.",
    "Herbsters failed campaign is Trumps first loss since Susan Wright lost her Texas special election House race in July 2021.",
    "But in his words of encouragement to Kuehl, the former president may have inadvertently revealed why he never backed him.",
    "Former President Donald Trump speaks from the podium during a rally, Sunday, May 1, 2022, in Greenwood, Neb.",
    "Yet while Trump declined to back Bacon, he also decided against endorsing Bacons sole primary challenger.",
    "This week, Trump had slightly more political capital at risk by choosing sides in two key primary races.",
    "His candidate fell short against Jim Pillen in the governors race, finishing second in a field of four.",
    "Mooney knocked off Rep. David McKinley in a battle of two incumbents thrown together by redistricting.",
    "There was one notable omission from Trumps endorsement list in Nebraska: GOP Rep. Don Bacon.",
    "And his big gamble proved successful when Vance came from behind to finish in first place.",
    "The former president was right about that: Bacon defeated Kuehl by a landslide margin.",
    "In his endorsement, Trump commended Smiths economic policies and gun rights advocacy.",
    "In his endorsement, Trump mentioned Millers advocacy for coal miners and gun rights.",
    "Were tracking Donald Trumps endorsement track record through the 2022 primaries.",
    "Get caught up here:\n May 3: Ohio and Indiana\n May 10: Nebraska and West Virginia",
    "That record marked him as far more aligned with Trumps interests than McKinley.",
    "West Virginia wins\nWV01\nRep. Carol Miller\nWon with 66 percent of the vote.",
    "Here is a look at the three Trump-endorsed candidates who won Tuesday.",
    "Nebraska wins\nNE03\nRep. Adrian Smith\nWon with 76 percent of the vote.",
    "Good luck, Steve, whoever the hell you are,? he said.",
    "WV02\nAlex Mooney\nWon with 54 percent of the vote.",
    "Trump did take one legit risk in endorsing J.D.",
    "She voted to overturn 2020 electoral votes.",
    "As for Herbster, Trump took the loss.",
    "Vance in the Ohio Senate primary."
