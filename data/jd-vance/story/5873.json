    "In his 1996 run, one Texas Republican declared that Buchanans opposition to free trade was a dagger aimed at the heart of everything we stand for in the world.?\nBuchanan, at the time, went after Bob Dole for having put the interests of the big banks ahead of the interests of American workers.?\nLike Perot and Buchanans campaigns, Trump drew from the recent history of working and middle class American families like the one described in Vances memoir  those left behind by the globalization of the American economy and a Left-Right immigration agenda hellbent on transforming the workforce and electorate.",
    "He said to cheers:\nThe question in this primary was do we want to have a border that protects our citizens, do we want to ship our jobs to China or keep them right here in America for American workers  do we want a Republican Party that stands for the donors who write checks for the Club for Growth or do we want a Republican Party for the people right here in Ohio?",
    "The first is that its often driven by donors, primarily Democratic donors, but unfortunately, donors on the right as well who want cheap labor.?\nIve heard them talk about this when they dont think anybodys listening  they want cheap labor and they dont care what consequences follow for their own country so that they can get that cheap labor,? Vance continued.",
    "Axios reports:\nThe Republican establishment privately regards Vance with the same disgust many felt toward Donald Trump when he entered the White House on Jan. 20, 2017.  Vance has made statements on the campaign trail that have repulsed establishment Republicans, including members of the Senate leadership.",
    "The themes, as derided by the Republican establishment in each election, were shaped around economic nationalism, national populism, and a rejection of the neoconservative Republican beltway in Washington, D.C.\nPerot was quickly labeled a frightening demagogue? in his 1992 run by Republican lawmakers.",
    "An establishment Republican Party that refused to do anything against the Sackler family which poisoned this state with drugs and an establishment Democrat Party that is actively encouraging the Mexican drug cartels to flood us with even worse drugs  how about we put them both in jail,? Vance said.",
    "At the time of the memoirs release, then-candidate Donald Trump was on his way to scoring the Republican presidential nomination against a crowded field of establishment types like Jeb Bush, economic libertarians such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and wealthy corporate executives like Carly Fiorina.",
    "Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,? Trump said during his July 2016 Republican National Convention (RNC) speech, vowing to punish multinational corporations for outsourcing jobs, reduce overall immigration levels, and dismantle the D.C. beltways thirst for foreign war.",
    "When Vance announced his candidacy for the Ohio Senate Republican primary, he did so by immediately pushing back against multinational corporations with near-monopolies in particular markets that have increasingly snuffed out small, family-owned businesses.",
    "Their messaging took on different variations that ultimately focused on the same Republican points that had been the fixture of GOP politics since at least the year 2000: Tax cuts, free marketism, promoting democracy worldwide, and reliving the Reagan Era.",
    "Vances memoir follows the struggles of his family in Middletown, Ohio, notably tackling the issues of addiction, quality of life, working class values, and the deindustrialization of Americas heartland through the lens of his childhood.",
    "As Breitbart News reported, Vances position that tariffs on foreign imports ought to be used to reshore Americas manufacturing base made him an enemy of the Club for Growth, which has promoted a free trade agenda for decades.",
    "Le Pen, like Trump, has routinely broken political orthodoxy with aggressive populist platforms that have featured tariffs, fast deportations, environmental conservation, and preservation of national heritage.",
    "Vance was publishing his memoir Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, the New York Times best-selling book that later became a major motion picture featuring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.",
    "The remarks were a clear break from carefully crafted Republican talking points that typically harp on the MS-13 Gang, crime, and terrorism as a way to escape discussing the economics of mass immigration.",
    "I want to fight for the small businesses who are struggling to hire and struggling to build a great company because the government and multinational corporations make it harder,? Vance said.",
    "That take was crushed when Vance was the only Republican in the race not to seek a relationship with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and to oppose intervention and U.S. military aid in Ukraine.",
    "Trumps populist agenda was so hated by beltway conservatives and the GOP establishment that the Koch brothers network poured millions into a last-ditch effort to stop his nomination.",
    "Republican insiders told Axios, after Vances victory, that the Ohio Senate candidates populist agenda will almost certainly face opposition from lawmakers in his own party.",
    "Frances Marine Le Pen, who leads the National Rally, at the time summed up the political realignment happening across the globe but most prominently in the United States.",
    "Months before announcing his Ohio Senate bid, Vance blamed corporate donors for waves of illegal immigration year after year in an interview with Breitbart News.",
    "The announcement kickstarted a series of populist-nationalist policy positions that Vance not only endorsed but urged fellow Republicans to get behind.",
    "Vance, with an endorsement from Trump, outpaced his Republican competitors by nearly 88,000 votes  winning all but 14 counties in Ohio.",
    "Consultants working for Vances competitors reportedly phoned Trump after results trickled in and credited his endorsement for the win.",
    "Trump had a much different message that harkened back to the 1992, 1996, and 1999 presidential runs of Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan.",
    "The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America first.",
