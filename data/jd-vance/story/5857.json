    "Next, the voters challenging the eligibility of North Carolina insurrectionist Rep. Madison Cawthorn to run for reelection had their day in federal appeals court on Tuesday, after a Trump-appointed lower court judge tossed their Constitutional challenge to Cawthorn's eligibility under the \"Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause\" of the 14th Amendment.",
    "As to actual reported results of voting on Tuesday, we cover, among other things, the Democratic U.S. House race watched closed by some on the progressive left between Rep.

    "Then, as we try to get caught up on a bunch of stuff that's been buried by larger stories (in Ukraine, at the Supreme Court) this week, a new memoir by Trump's last Defense Secretary, Mark Esper, claims that Trump wondered why the military couldn't just shoot Black Lives Matter protesters in the street.",
    "While all of this is great for Trump's considerable ego, it remains to be seen whether having a bunch of far-right, radical loons and alleged abusers who insist the election was stolen from Trump in 2020 (despite any evidence to support the claim) will be good or bad for the GOP this November.",
    "In this case, at least in Lucas (Toledo) and Cuyahoga (Cleveland) it appears the e-pollbook vendor misprogrammed them to print out barcodes on ballot cards that subsequently brought up the ballot for the wrong party when voters put those ballot cards into the BMDs to try and cast their votes.",
    "Nonetheless, the new maps created by the GOP-majority Redistricting Commission in the Buckeye State will likely result in a 13 to 2 -- or maybe 12 to 3 -- advantage in favor of Republicans in Ohio's U.S. House delegation, as redistricting expert Dave Daley told me via email today.",
    "Finally, Desi Doyen joins us for our latest Green News Report, as unprecedented heat in South Asia is now \"testing the limits of human survivability\" and much more, including even some good news on Denmark going all-electric...\nCLICK HERE TO LISTEN OR DOWNLOAD TODAYS SHOW!...",
    "Either way, problems like these do little to foster confidence in our electoral system, particularly on BMD systems which are already 100% unverifiable after elections, making it impossible to know if votes cast via such systems actually reflect the intent of any voter.",
    "In other cases, voters were given printed ballots that they could fill in by hand (begging the question as to why all voters weren't simply given reliable, verifiable hand-marked paper ballots to use in the first place to avoid these ongoing electoral nightmares!)",
    "All of the U.S. House races in Ohio were run on a new map found by the state Supreme Court to violate the state's constitution, requiring districts that reflect the state's partisan balance after a 2018 ballot iniative for fairer maps won 70% of the vote.",
    "As Constitutional law expert John Bonifaz of Free Speech for People, the group representing the voter challengers, summarized on Twitter yesterday: \"'Let's say you want to run for office at 12 years old, or something like that,' Judge James Wynn said.",
    "On the Republican side of Tuesday's primaries, all of Trump's endorsed candidates -- no matter how crazy, no matter how many times they've been accused of domestic violence or sexual harassment -- won yesterday in both Ohio and Indiana.",
    "In Ohio, in at least three different counties (Lucas, Cuyahoga and Williams) reports of misprogrammed systems prevented voters from casting their votes or forced them to return later in the day to do so.",
    "Turner lost once again on Tuesday, reportedly by a much wider margin this time, before suggesting in her fiery concession speech that she may be planning an independent run for President in 2024.",
    "That was enough, apparently, to win Trump's endorsement, which appears to have catapulted Vance from third place, just a few weeks ago, to a reported win on Tuesday night.",
    "The contest was a re-run of last Summer's special election to fill the House seat vacated by Rep. Marcia Fudge after she was tapped to serve as Joe Biden's HUD Secretary.",
    "In some cases, poll workers were able to manually punch in codes to bring up the correct party ballots and precincts onto the BMD systems for voters.",
    "It should be a big year for them, but there are still a whole lot of X Factors that could affect so-called Conventional Wisdom on this.",
    "Electronic pollbooks used as part of computer touchscreen Ballot Marking Devices (BMDs) appear to be the culprit this time.",
    "The Q&A between Cawthorn's defense attorney and one of the judge's on the appeals panel was...um...kinda mind-blowing.",
    "But he changed his tune when he decided to run for the open Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen.",
    "Luckily, confidence in our voting systems hasn't been a big concern in the U.S. of late, right?",
    "Cawthorn's counsel: Yes, the state has no role + must allow that 12 year old on the ballot.\"",
    "Now, Vance says, Trump's \"a great President, certainly the best President of my lifetime.\"",
