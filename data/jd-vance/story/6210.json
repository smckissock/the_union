    "Boyle then mentioned a recently released ad where Vance attacks the media for calling Americans who support a wall on our southern border racist.?\nIm so sick of every time that I talked about the border, getting accused of being racist or xenophobic, when the reason I care about the southern border is because I dont want to live in a community that has a ton of sex trafficking.",
