    "According to Rogier, “we’re able to put our members in the Oval Office so that they can see how these leaders act and also decide how they themselves want to shape their own leadership style.”\nUnfortunately, rather than really explore the contours of their decision-making, the Clintons — who seem to not realize or not care that they’re in the stage of life when they can offer hard, revealing truths — are more concerned with molding their images.",
    "Without many concrete lessons to teach, save some bits on public speaking (there’s some bitter irony there too, as Hillary tells viewers to practice speaking in front of a mirror, and then lessons later says that she has never read her victory speech out loud), the Clintons resort to messages we’ve mostly heard before, maybe at a mid-budget hotel conference complete with a cold breakfast buffet.",
    "And while the Clintons’ political opponents have generally overstated their personal role in Haiti’s continued struggles, Kim Ives, the editor of the largest Haitian weekly newspaper, Haïti Liberté, admitted in 2016 to the BBC that “a lot of Haitians are not big fans of the Clintons.”\nWhat accounts for those failures — and what might they say about politics as the art of the possible?",
    "As if to convince themselves, the Clintons are constantly justifying their presence on MasterClass with high-flying anecdotes — at one point, Hillary talks about why you should work hard, but not too hard, and uses the time she fainted into a car during the 2016 presidential campaign while she had pneumonia as an example of pushing it too far.",
    "It’s pretty clear why MasterClass, a web-based platform that produces video tutorials helmed by experts in their respective fields, wanted Clinton as an instructor: The publicity from her reading her speech drew more eyes to the platform, which was valued at $2.75 billion in the spring of 2021 according to CNBC.",
    "Today, for the price of $180 per year, viewers can learn to write verses with Grammy Award-winning rapper Nas, practice their shooting stroke with NBA star Steph Curry, build television characters with “Insecure” creator Issa Rae or make a galette with James Beard Award-winner Alice Waters.",
    "The ambivalence at the heart of MasterClass’ political tutorials — with political leaders talking about everything but politics, which itself might not even be teachable — mirrors a broader ambivalence about the role of America’s politicians in its cultural life.",
    "Instead of delivering it to screaming supporters, Clinton read it to a room of masked-up camera operators and producers, all working for the online education company MasterClass (who politely clapped at its conclusion), backed by a heavy-handed piano track.",
    "Nowadays, fandom is more likely to draw students to the Clintons, George and Laura Bush, and even fellow MasterClass instructors Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice than any real belief these politicians can teach a mastery of politics or policy.",
    "At a moment when Americans are hankering for “political outsiders” and candidates sell themselves as “disruptors” in Washington, MasterClass’ pivot to politics raises far more questions than it answers: Who do we expect our politicians to be?",
    "“[We want to make] it possible for everyone to learn from the world’s best across a variety of subjects.”\nAny comprehensive digital library like MasterClass would be well served to include material on political life.",
    "Donald Trump’s victory — following that of Barack Obama, notably another candidate who built a fervent fanbase based in part on identity and ensuing celebrity — changed the image of American political leadership.",
    "But students may wonder just what kind of wisdom Clinton — and fellow political leaders like her husband, Bill, or George and Laura Bush, who have their own course on leadership coming — are prepared to impart.",
    "War stories have always been an academic staple, but MasterClass promises specific knowledge and expertise, such as design tips from Marc Jacobs or a primer on astrophysics from Neil deGrasse Tyson.",
    "The question is relevant because these times, more than any other in memory, have raised questions about whether political leadership is a skill that can be learned or a gift to be used or abused.",
    "Reports on how MasterClass compensates its teachers suggest Clinton was paid at least six figures up front, plus a revenue cut for her full course, which the company released in December of 2021.",
    "How can we learn from them to be better leaders in our own lives?”\nNonetheless, politicians on MasterClass teach courses that are substantively different from much of the other content on offer.",
    "Navigate to the “food” section of the platform, for example, and you’ll find many celebrity chefs taking you step by step through how to shop and how to prepare some of their most famous dishes.",
    "They already all know what happened to me, and they know if I can be back here, they should be too.”\nClinton concludes in his course, “I have to do my own version of hanging up the paintings.",
    "Popular in Haiti for helping to return democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power while he was president, Clinton stayed involved in the country after leaving the White House.",
    "MasterClass certainly is in the learning camp, suggesting students can pick up professional tips from political leaders just like from designers or writers or sports stars.",
    "“And by reaching for unity, decency, and what President Lincoln called the better angels of our nature, we met that challenge.”\nThis is, of course, an alternate history.",
    "At another, Bill uses the example of sending troops into harm’s way to explain how, while some decisions are necessarily lonely, you shouldn’t make loneliness a virtue.",
    "For students, the attraction to politicians on MasterClass, then, is not to figure out how to win an election, but to get a peek behind the curtain into their lives.",
    "MasterClass believes that Bill Clinton can teach leadership and Hillary Clinton can teach resilience because of the demands placed on them while in the public eye.",

    "If you’ve never picked up a tennis racket, watching Serena Williams talk about hitting punishing forehands isn’t going to make you a Grand Slam champion.",
    "“Fundamentally, this election challenged us to decide what it means to be an American in the 21st century,” Hillary Clinton said in her victory speech.",
    "Dominique Ansel will simply teach you how to make pastries, while Simone Biles has lessons both on how to master the uneven bars and to overcome fear.",
    "You might gain something, though, from her approach to mental toughness, and you might remember her groundstroke lessons should you pick up a racket.",
    "If the Clintons are reaching more people via MasterClass than your average motivational speaker, it’s because they are celebrities, not politicians.",
    "But the Clintons mostly forgo political analysis, instead centering their lessons almost entirely around concepts like organization and resilience.",
    "He believes in the promise of its name — that taking courses from the service can start users on a path toward mastery of the subjects on offer.",
    "“They change the course of world events, make tough calls, help millions and manage through crises and conflicts none of us could even imagine.",
    "Still, offering courses from politicians is not just about diversifying content for Rogier — he believes they do have something to teach us.",
    "They are politicians interested in explaining politics, and also celebrities tasked with teaching other people how to be more like them.",
    "Its sales skyrocketed during the pandemic, and financial analysts reading the tea leaves believe the company could go public this year.",

    "“It’s good to see you again, I just can’t believe that you all have come back here so quickly,” Clinton replied.",
    "On one side of a major thoroughfare, according to Clinton, artists set up shops to sell their wares to tourists.",
    "It’s the sort of story MasterClass was surely looking for when they agreed to a deal with the former president.",
    "“Our values endure, our democracy stands strong, and our motto remains ‘e pluribus unum’ — out of many, one.",
