    "#PAsen @ChrisStigall pic.twitter.com/cfVB7r7PEY\nWhether Barnette meant to intentionally mislead during the interview or if she simply misspoke remains unknown, but falsely claiming to have voted for Trump in the 2016 primary as a MAGA badge of pride makes for a rather odd hill to die on considering some of the presidents most ardent supporters initially opposed him (some quite virulently) in the primary.",
    "Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,? Trump stated, noting that she has many things in her past which have not been properly explained or vetted, but if she is able to do so, she will have a wonderful future in the Republican Partyand I will be behind her all the way.?",

    "In an interview on the Chris Stigall show, Barnette was asked about her first vote in the state of Pennsylvania, to which she responded that she voted for Trump in the 2016 primaries.",
    "Aside from the passage in her book, Barnettes past tweets show that she firmly opposed President Trump throughout the primary, routinely knocking his moral character and demeanor.",
    "The one that really pops out in my mind is 2016 for the primary for President Trump, as well as for the general election for President Trump,? she said on the show.",
    "Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate Kathy Barnette appears to have been caught making a false claim about voting for Donald Trump during the 2016 primaries.",
    "Though I didnt vote for Trump in the primaries, by the time the general election rolled around I was firmly on the first car of the Trump train.",
    "http://t.co/djJRNDlJ2C #WAARadio\nI agree, there is a real disconnect, for me, in #DrBenCarson endorsing #Trump over #Cruz.",
