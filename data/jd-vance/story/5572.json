    "Citing local frustration,? she added, Kurt Schrader is not that candidate.?\nIn a statement, Mr. Schraders spokeswoman, Deb Barnes, said he has a proven ability to bring everyone together  rural, urban and suburban  to find common ground and deliver wins that make a real difference.?\nElectability is playing out in a different way in South Texas, where Jessica Cisneros is challenging Representative Henry Cuellar, the most staunchly anti-abortion Democrat in the House, in a district where conservative Democrats have often thrived.",

    "Now they want people who will pass Bidens agenda and hold swing seats, and progressives need to make the case that they are the best chance to do that.?\nIn Pennsylvania, a House primary for the seat around Pittsburgh being vacated by Representative Mike Doyle, who is retiring, will vividly test that argument.",
