    "Ohio congressional nominee J.R. Majewski\nTuesday's night's biggest surprise came in Ohios newly gerrymandered 9th Congressional District, when J.R. Majewski, a QAnon-aligned activist who attended the Jan. 6 Trump rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol, defeated two Republican state legislators to win the nod to take on 20-term Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur.",

    "However, Sommer reports, Majewski has continued to associate with Paine: In February, Majewski told Paine that he was willing to fight Democrats in a \"civil war\" (as Sommer put it) and even invited Paine to host a November victory party for him less than two weeks ago.",
    "And while Majewski, unlike his two foes, doesnt appear to have run TV commercials, he did still generate attention with an online video in which he told his audience hed do whatever it takes to return this country back to its former glory? just before cocking a rifle.",
    "Majewski edged out state Rep. Craig Riedel 36-31, with state Sen. Theresa Gavarone taking third with 29%, and will now face Kaptur in a Toledo area constituency that would have supported Trump 51-48a massive shift from Biden's 59-40 victory in her current district.",
    "In that appearance, writes the Daily Beasts Will Sommer, Majewski identified himself as a supporter of the conspiracy cult and said, I wear this shirt with pride.?\nFollowing Trumps defeat, Majewski bragged that he was helping bring people to the Jan. 6 rally.",
    "That day, he also appeared with a QAnon promoter named Zak Paine, who posted a video with Majewski with Paine saying theyd made it all the way to the base of the Capitol building? after violence broke out.",
    "Majewski, who previously served in the Air Force, made news in 2020 when he used paint to transform his yard into a giant Trump 2020? banner, a move that Trump himself praised on Twitter.",
    "Majewski also benefited from outside support from Drain the DC Swamp, a PAC that spent close to $400,000, mostly on mail and radio ads promoting him and bashing the two state lawmakers.",
    "Gavarone, who is closer to GOP leadership, sported a notable endorsement of her own from 5th District Rep. Bob Latta, who currently represents just over half the revamped 9th.",
    "Majewski will now go up against Kaptur, who is the longest serving-woman in the history of the House, for a seat that Republicans engineered to try and win for themselves.",
    "Vance, saying, We love you, J.R.? (Given Trump's difficulty in remembering the initials of Ohio Republicans, though, it's always possible this was just a happy accident.)",
    "Listen to a breakdown of the May primaries on Daily Kos Elections The Downballot podcast with David Nir and David Beard\nx\nx\nYou need to enable JavaScript to run this app.",
    "The candidate ultimately raised and self-funded just over $250,000 through late April, which was actually slightly more than the amount Gavarone brought in.",
    "Majewski soon appeared decked out in a QAnon shirt in an interview with Fox News, and he also showed up on a QAnon livestream sporting related garb.",
    "Riedel ran commercials touting his support from Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, including one in which he pledged to join Jordans Freedom Caucus.",
    "The congresswoman, though, is hoping that her deep ties to the Toledo area will help her win over enough conservatives to hold on.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "We are primarily accountable to readers like you because donations from readers like you are our biggest source of income.",
    "Riedel and Gavarone each enjoyed considerably deeper networks as sitting elected officials, and they made use of them.",
    "Until Tuesday night, though, Majewskis prospects of even making it to the general election seemed remote.",
    "Even Majewski, when he launched his campaign, acknowledged, My grandparents supported Marcy Kaptur.",
    "(Riedel took in a little more than $435,000, with a large portion of that self-funded.)",
    "However, Majewski proved to be a tougher opponent than either official likely realized.",
    "Trump himself gave Majewski a shoutout at a late April rally for Senate candidate J.D.",
    "That's not just journalists, but fact-checkers, editors, and administrative staff.",
    "(After his win, another video surfaced of him in a Let's Go Brandon\" rap video.",
    "We don't have corporate backers that are only in it for the bottom line.",
    "My grandmother adored Marcy Kaptur and so did my great-grandmother.",
    "It's important:\n Media outlets shed 28,637 jobs last year alone.",
