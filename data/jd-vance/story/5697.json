    "3 explosive effects of overturning Roe\nOhio's GOP Senate primary showcases 2 flavors of Trump\nWhy Republicans cheered a GDP drop\nThe 1 thing Biden got exactly right\nKarine Jean-Pierre to become 1st Black White House press secretary\nMail-order abortion pill sales are surging in red states\nSchumer: Senate will vote to codify Roe next week\nUnderstanding the Supreme Court leak\nPentagon: 'No impact' from Russia's attempts to strike arms flowing into Ukraine\nThe depressing spectacle of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\nU.S. is letting Ukraine field-test mysterious new Phoenix Ghost drones",
    "In the days since the leaked draft of a majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade (1973) was published by Politico, Democrats have convinced themselves that this is a huge political gift for the party and an equally massive liability for Republicans  because the country is overwhelmingly pro-choice and doesn't want to see the landmark decision reversed.",
    "Just a few months ago, in late February, 48 Senate Democrats voted to advance a bill  the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA)  that would enshrine the right to an abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, despite strong opposition to late-term abortion in the public at large.",
    "A Democratic Party that placed itself near the center of public opinion by promising to codify abortion rights in federal law up through the early weeks of the second trimester would win a lot of support, even if it left the most maximalist members of the party clamoring for more.",
    "Support for abortion rights comes in at around 61 percent during the first three months of pregnancy, but it falls to around 35 percent during the second three months, and then falls again, all the way down to 20 percent support, during the final three months prior to birth.",
    "As if to demonstrate this move wasn't just an empty gesture meant to appease the only people paying attention at the time (pro-choice activists), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has now announced that Democrats will bring the WHPA up for a vote again next week.",
    "Now it's certainly possible that Republican state restrictions on abortion after Roe is overturned will end up being so outrageously harsh that public opinion in many places will recoil in the other direction, giving Democrats the momentum on the issue they're hoping for.",
    "In making their case for placing abortion at the center of their messaging over the next six months, Democrats point to multiple polls showing broad-based opposition to overturning Roe and widespread support for the pro-choice position.",
    "I suspect the number of Americans who grasp this crucial fact is quite low  which means hostility to the pending decision could well dissipate once it comes down and voters in solidly blue states realize that nothing has changed.",
    "Going further might placate the maximalists, but it would likely win the party fewer votes overall, thereby decreasing the chances of the Dems accomplishing much of anything to protect reproductive rights at the national level.",
    "While it's possible to imagine scenarios in which the Democrats took advantage of widespread anger against the high court's actions to give them an edge in the upcoming midterm elections, the party isn't following that path.",
    "Base mobilization is important, but it can backfire if the mobilizing position alienates or actively antagonizes other voters while also handing the opposing party material it can use to mobilize its own ranks.",
    "But how many of the people expressing support for Roe understand that overturning it will lead not to an automatic nationwide ban on the procedure but rather to the issue being returned to state legislatures?",
    "It won't pass, but it's hard to see how anything positive will be accomplished, beyond base mobilization, by getting so many members of the party on the public record favoring such a bill.",
    "On the contrary, Democratic officeholders and candidates are staking out positions just as far out of the mainstream as Republicans seeking to ban abortion outright at the state level.",
    "The days when a Democratic politician with aspirations for higher office would use Bill Clinton's formulation about keeping the procedure \"safe, legal, and rare\" are now long gone.",
    "Vance lost little time in labeling that \"a barbaric position anywhere in the world,\" including in European nations, which \"typically don't allow abortion after 12 weeks.\"",
    "But it's also the case that when they are asked whether abortion should be permitted in the first, second, and third trimesters, the results are far more conflicted.",
    "It's certainly true that when Americans are asked by pollsters whether they are pro-choice, around 60 percent say yes and have done so for quite a long time.",
    "Public opinion among self-identifying Democrats has been moving further left on numerous issues over the past decade, very much including abortion.",
    "Vance in the Ohio Senate race this November, to come out this week on Fox News favoring no restrictions on abortion through 40 weeks of pregnancy.",
    "It's also the case that most Americans support exceptions (for rape, incest, and the life of the mother) all the way through pregnancy.",
    "This shift has been picked up in Gallup polls from 1996 down to 2018, and it's also present in a more recent survey from a year ago.",
    "But that will only happen if the Dems don't stake out a position equally far outside of the mainstream in the opposite direction.",
    "It's quite a feat to make Vance sound like a paragon of moderation and reasonableness, but Ryan has managed to accomplish it.",
    "Democrats need to figure out how to ride the tiger of justified rage at the Supreme Court's looming reversal of Roe.",
    "The most recent Gallup poll to ask about parental-consent laws (from 2011) found 71 percent support for them.",
    "But the American default comes nowhere near support for a blanket right to terminate a pregnancy on demand.",
    "The same might be said of the decision by Rep Tim Ryan, the Democrat who will be facing Republican J.D.",
    "Greg Abbott in Texas, appears eager to do something similar in his own race.)",
    "The WHPA also would have knocked down parental consent laws in 37 states.",
    "If they fail, they run the considerable risk of being devoured by it.",
    "The result is as likely to hurt the Dems as to help them in November.",
    "But what about expressed support for abortion rights in general?",
    "That's what Democrats are in danger of doing with abortion.",
    "(Beto O'Rourke, the Democrat challenging Republican Gov.",
    "(Vance is right about abortion policy in Europe.)",
    "There are indeed polls that support those views.",
    "And on that, we have reason to worry.",
    "It doesn't need to be this way.",
    "This is a mistake."
