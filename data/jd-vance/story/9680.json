    "And anyone who doesn’t think that Mexican drug cartels essentially constitute an army waging war isn’t really paying attention.",
    "There were 164,973 encounters in February alone, a 63% increase over last February, and higher than February 2020 by 350%.",
    "Migrants into the U.S. are more often than not workers or families looking for a better life in a free country.",
    "American lives and livelihoods are negatively affected by the open southern border in numerous other ways.",
    "“To put it in context, 200,000 Russians invaded Ukraine, give or take,” writes Senate candidate J.D.",
    "Tens of thousands of Americans are dying due to overdoses on drugs smuggled across the border.",
