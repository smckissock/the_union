    "pic.twitter.com/lRwLHcWYlc\n— Rep. Elise Stefanik (@RepStefanik) February 24, 2022\nI was heartened by this one, a tweet from a man who was careful as a candidate not to offend Trumpy populists:\nPutin’s invasion of Ukraine is an assault on a sovereign nation and will have devastating consequences for Ukrainian citizens.",
    "— Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) February 24, 2022\nAnd I’m surprised by this one:\nMissouri GOP senator Josh Hawley calls for arming Ukraine and sanctioning Russia: \"Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine and invasion of its territory must be met with strong American resolve.\"",
    "I like the way one Twitter pal summarized the conflict: “Russia telling Ukraine ‘we are one people’ as it lobs missiles at it is the whole situation in a nutshell.”\nUkrainian Ambassador To Russian Ambassador: There is no purgatory for war criminals.",
    "— Senate Republicans (@SenateGOP) February 24, 2022\nTrump ally Elise Stefanik is also pro-Ukraine, although her statement amply demonstrates the logic of the “Never Democrat” camp that I described:\nMy statement on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ??",
    "“They will ignore Trump’s praise and instead focus on — and agree with — Trump’s statement that Putin would not have done this if Trump had won.” Right, that’s the “Never Democrats” position, refocusing the Ukraine debate on Biden’s weakness.",
    "pic.twitter.com/OQopoxPYD9\n— nikki mccann ramírez (@NikkiMcR) November 26, 2019\nThe third camp is the “Never Democrat” Republicans, the people whose supreme duty is to find a way to dunk on Biden and advance the GOP’s electoral interests.",
    "Jim Swift’s not wrong that the daytime speakers featuring traditional hawks like Marco Rubio might sound different from the evening MAGA programming:\nThe 3:50 PM show at CPAC is completely different than the 8 o'clock show.",
    "Most of them say that their only concern is making sure American troops aren’t sacrificed to protect the territorial integrity of a far-off land but occasionally one will admit that they’re actually on Russia’s side.",
    "This statement that he issued last night turns out to be far more representative of opinion among Washington Republicans, including some aligned with Trump, than the anti-anti-Russia nationalist view is.",
    "Maybe Republicans who were considering taking the “America First” position watched this and ultimately gagged at the thought:\nMore likely, though, is that this comes down to electoral politics.",
    "Republican politicians are so terrified of alienating MAGA voters, though, that one might have expected them to adopt the Tucker/Vance line that there’s no reason to quarrel with Putin.",
    "Hawley and Stefanik are smart people and know that the next weeks and months will bring endless coverage on American television of innocent Ukrainians being pulverized by Russia.",
    "Behold:\nMy statement on Russia's invasion of Ukraine: pic.twitter.com/EWa0i6I74Q\n— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) February 24, 2022\nAmerica stands with the people of Ukraine.",
    "And in order to call Biden weak here, you necessarily have to believe that Putin is an enemy and that stopping him would be a good thing, a sign of American strength.",
    "Even Trump in his pitiful comments a few days ago paying tribute to Putin’s “genius” was careful to say that Russia never would have taken Ukraine on his watch.",
    "If that’s the direction right-wing populist influencers are headed, that’s the direction we’d normally anticipate “the fear caucus” in Congress to take.",
    "Zelensky gave an unexpectedly strong speech last night to rouse his country as the invasion began, one that circulated widely on American social media.",
    "Those people are destined to tilt pro-Ukraine in this conflict because the easiest dunk on Biden when a U.S. enemy is advancing is that he’s weak.",
    "pic.twitter.com/9H6bTrSykl\n— John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) February 24, 2022\nHawley is probably the most nationalist Republican in the Senate.",
    "It’s anyone’s guess how large each camp is relative to the other (although it’s a safe bet that the third is much bigger than the other two).",
    "As much as their instinct is to pander to populist righties, they don’t want to be on the wrong side of an issue that might break 75/25.",
    "Like, say, this guy, who copped to it in 2019:\nTucker: \"Why do I care what is going on in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?",
    "I’ll leave you with the Ukrainian ambassador to the UN telling the Russians to their faces last night that they’re going to hell.",
    "Congrats to Mitt, who’s been waiting 10 years to use that line and finally got the opportunity in the grimmest of circumstances.",
    "It’s possible that all but the most devout nationalists in the Carlson mold sympathize with Ukraine’s plight, Hawley included.",
    "“In coming days every top Republican lawmaker will be asked about Trump praising Putin for the invasion,” predicts Patterico.",
    "Particularly if it would mean letting Biden argue that he, not the GOP, is the one showing “strength” during this episode.",
    "It’s cynical in the sense that it’s more concerned with partisan point-scoring than with national unity against Putin.",
    "One is the old-school hawks like Romney who genuinely believe in supporting western-aligned liberal democracies.",
    "Vance) who insist that the U.S. has no interest in checking a fascist regime’s westward expansion into Europe.",
    "But at least it requires taking Ukraine’s side in the conflict, which we should regard as a moral victory.",
    "pic.twitter.com/v7UTOmEs58\n— Jim Swift (@JimSwiftDC) February 24, 2022\nRon DeSantis speaks this afternoon.",
    "This senseless, unprovoked attack undermines democracy worldwide and we must hold Russia accountable.",
    "If anyone was going to take a Tucker-esque line towards the Russia/Ukraine conflict, it was Hawley.",
    "I’m curious to see what sort of rhetoric we hear about Russia and Ukraine this weekend at CPAC.",
    "They go straight to hell pic.twitter.com/JOFOT9Rzdb\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 24, 2022",
    "His only competition is Tom Cotton, really, and Cotton is a committed hawk.",
    "The second is the nationalist ideologues (or pretend ideologues like J.D.",
    "Two days ago I wrote about the three camps within the GOP.",
    "That’s a hard thing to have to shrug off every day.",
    "And we pray for the Ukrainian people and for peace.",
    "Does he take a side or just ignore the subject?",
    "Enjoy the veal and be sure to tip your waiter.",
    "Yet here he is, sounding more like Romney.",
    "There’s good news on a dark day, though.",
    "Why shouldn't I root for Russia?",
    "Which by the way I am.\"",
    "But they’re not.",
