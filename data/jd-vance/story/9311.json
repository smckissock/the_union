    "In a recent op-ed in The Hill, “Reducing illegal drugs in the US requires the tools of trade, not ‘war’”, Kathleen Frydl, an award-winning political historian and author of “The Drug Wars in America, 1940-1973,” wrote:\n“We hear a lot about fentanyl crossing the southern border with Mexico, mostly from Republicans who claim this is the result of “open borders.”\nOften these remarks make mention of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers also crossing the border, implying that drug trafficking organizations recruit them to smuggle this dangerous drug into the United States.",
    "The Republican Political Message\nIn spite of the facts, many Republicans have been building the narrative that fentanyl overdoses, and the tragedy around them, is the fault of the alleged “open borders” policies related to immigration and their favorite talking points about the “Biden Border Crisis.” They have used social media, TV appearances, and paid ads to muddle the issues of the international drug trade with issues related to migrants seeking safety at the border.",
    "The ad offers not a solution to that problem but instead claims, “Vance will finish the wall, end welfare for illegals, and eliminate all federal tax dollars for sanctuary cities.” This reference to the border wall and a list of dog-whistles has nothing to do with stopping drug trafficking, nor do they anything but signal that immigrants and immigration are closely linked to opioids to justify his nativism and populist appeal to halt immigration.",
    "Most House and Senate Republicans voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the $1.2 trillion bipartisan bill that invests in technologies and infrastructure – including “$430 million to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the construction and modernization of land ports of entry and equipment and fixtures for operations,” according to the National Immigration Forum.",
    "The GOP obsession with focussing on the wrong problem and the wrong solutions is costing thousands of lives, contributing to the flood of drugs, the continued growth of a flourishing, sophisticated network of cartels, but there is clearly a better answer: go where the drugs are, not where they aren’t.",
    "Going beyond the splashy headlines Republicans are quick to amplify, Reichlin-Melnick found that in one Customs and Border Protection report about fentanyl seizures at the border, of the 796 pounds captured, all but one pound was captured at an official port of entry or vehicle checkpoint.",
    "Rather than meet that real problem head-on and increase inspections of every cargo shipment, the GOP prefers to focus on where illegal drug flow is low, but the political benefit is high: focusing on men, women, and children fleeing violence and seeking safe haven at our borders.",
    "The O’Rourke clip is followed by several news headlines that warn about fentanyl, implying that one has to do with the other, despite the repeatedly demonstrated ineffectiveness of the wall as a deterrent to migration, let alone the unrelated issue of illicit drug importation.",
    "It is on the solutions playing field that Democrats may find some opportunities to turn the Republican focus on fentanyl and opioid overdoses against them and lead the country towards solutions that will actually reduce importations of the deadly drug to American communities.",
    "The nativist, xenophobic, and coded messages of Republicans can be potent if left unchallenged, but because the reality of opioid and drug importation is so divorced from Republican rhetoric and “policy” proposals, it opens the door to forceful Democratic response.",
    "Whether or not voters buy this prepacked lie may largely depend if they understand Republicans’ motivation behind it and whether or not they hear a sensible alternative solution for addressing their concerns over fentanyl and the dramatic increase in overdoses.",
    "We don’t pretend to have the answers to solve the issues of hard drugs, but we know that Republicans’ cynical political opportunism here is detrimental to both improving both our immigration system and reducing the problems of this dangerous drug.",

    "It’s just math.” The Independent Senator, who caucuses with Democrats, called for additional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance resources deployed in Latin America to help identify and interdict fentanyl importation.",
    "While it is true that the majority of fentanyl bound for the United States comes from Mexico, the organizations that traffic in it do not risk their product on desperate people facing steep odds and a dangerous crossing.",
    "The reality under Biden is that almost 80% of those encountered by authorities at the border have been immediately removed, put in detention, or in the case of children, put in a government-run or contracted shelter.",
    "He recently pointed out that migrants bringing in drugs was notability absent from the Drug Enforcement Administration assessment of how fentanyl and other hard drugs are being smuggled into California from Mexico.",
    "This money, which most Republicans opposed, can help purchase new screening technology, which as the Washington Post reported is showing results in terms of Fentanyl seizures by analyzing the contents of trucks.",
    "Unfortunately, too many Republican candidates are more interested in scoring political points than truly helping the American people who are suffering the consequences of our inability to deal with this reality.",
    "Republicans intentionally cultivate conflation between the issues, which leaves little room for the viewer to draw a different or more accurate conclusion about what steps need to be taken to address fentanyl.",
    "Democrats Should Draw a Contrast and Lean-In with Solutions\nThis misdirection play by Republicans is something Democrats should lean into because it exposes the hollowness of the Republican campaign strategy.",
    "How many dangerous criminals released into America is enough?” The rapid succession of these three rhetorical questions creates the false premise that they are all a part of the same problem.",
    "At our online database, we have compiled nearly 100 unique examples of Republican campaign ads that employ this misleading, xenophobic tactic in just the first three months of the year.",
    "Republicans are spending millions of dollars on political ads intentionally misleading the public so that the fentanyl crisis is mainly seen through the lens of their nativist agenda.",

    "Meanwhile, despite the apocalyptic rhetoric from many Republicans, immigration is, in fact, way down, with net immigration to the U.S. just 25% of what it was five years ago.",
    "Regardless, there is not a correlation between the number of new migrants seeking refuge at our borders and the amount of fentanyl and other drugs coming into the country.",
    "Though their strategy may be clear to some, without a counter-narrative based on facts and values, the Republican lies and misdirection strategy can be quite convincing.",
    "If they are going to effectively respond to Republicans’ disingenuous narrative, Democrats must communicate a plan for real solutions to the nation’s fentanyl problems.",
    "While we do not support the Biden administration’s deterrence focus at the border, the right-wing framing of Biden’s supposed “open borders” is filled with falsehoods.",
    "Occasionally U.S. border officials seize packages of fentanyl, and lots of seizures provide indirect evidence of a lot of supply that makes the crossing undetected.",
    "The ad begins with a clip of his Democratic opponent, Beto O’Rourke, from an interview during his Presidential bid in 2020, saying he would knock down the wall.",
    "And the immediate expulsion of many migrants means that the overall data of total encounters includes many individuals who are multi-counted, as CBP data show.",
