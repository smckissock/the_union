    "What I felt afterward was this: For all you knuckleheads on Fox who say that Biden cant put two sentences together, heres a news flash: He just put NATO together, Europe together and the whole Western alliance together  stretching from Canada up to Finland and all the way to Japan  to help Ukraine protect its fledgling democracy from Vladimir Putins fascist assault.",
    "But the recent primaries and the investigations around the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol are revealing a movement by Trump and his supporters that is not propelled by any coherent set of policies, but rather by a gigantic lie  that Biden did not freely and fairly win a majority of Electoral College votes and therefore is an illegitimate president.",
    "And they will never do what principled Republicans running for office or acting as elections officials did after the 2020 election  accept the votes as they were tabulated in their states, accept the court orders that confirmed that there were no significant irregularities and permit Biden to legitimately take power.",
    "And they are more than hinting that in any close election in 2024  or even ones that arent so close  they would be willing to depart from established constitutional rules and norms and award that election to Trump or other Republican candidates who didnt actually garner the most votes.",
    "That is why so many allied leaders have privately said to Biden, as he and his team have revived the Western alliance from the splintered pieces that Trump left it in, Thank God  America is back.? And then they add, But for how long??\nBiden cannot answer that question.",
    "But with every passing day, every mass shooting, every racist dog whistle, every defund-the-police initiative, every nation-sundering Supreme Court ruling, every speaker run off a campus, every bogus claim of election fraud, I wonder if he can bring us back together.",
    "McCarthy publicly denied the fact that immediately after Jan. 6 he explicitly (and on tape) told his Republican colleagues that he expected Trump to be impeached for inspiring the insurrection and that McCarthy intended to tell him he should resign.",
    "Because it is one thing to elect Donald Trump and pro-Trump candidates who want to restrict immigration, ban abortions, slash corporate taxes, pump more oil, curb sex education in schools and liberate citizens from mask mandates in a pandemic.",
    "It clearly weighs on him that we have built a global alliance to support Ukraine, to reverse the Russian invasion and to defend core American principles abroad  the right to freedom and self-determination of all peoples  while the G.O.P.",
    "And he knows thats why he was elected  a majority of Americans worried that the country was coming apart at the seams and that this old war horse called Biden, with his bipartisan instincts, was the best person to knit us back together.",
    "The far left also saddled Biden and every Democratic candidate with radical notions like defund the police?  an insane mantra that would have most harmed the Black and Hispanic base of the Democratic Party had it been implemented.",
    "It is stomach-turning to watch the number of Trump Republicans running for office affirming his Big Lie, when we know that they know that we know that they know that they do not believe a single word of what they are saying.",
    "It has been the best performance of alliance management and consolidation since another president whom I covered and admired  who also was said to be incapable of putting two sentences together: George H.W.",
    "In doing so, he has enabled Ukraine to inflict significant losses on Russias invading army, thanks to a rapid deployment of U.S. and NATO trainers and massive transfers of precision weapons.",
    "Have no doubt: These people will never do what Al Gore did in 2000  submit to a decision of the courts in an extremely close election and recognize his opponent as the legitimate president.",
    "I ate a tuna salad sandwich with tomato on whole wheat bread, with a bowl of mixed fruit and a chocolate milkshake for dessert that was so good it should have been against the law.",
    "To defeat Trumpism we need only, say, 10 percent of Republicans to abandon their party and join with a center-left Biden, which is what he was elected to be and still is at heart.",
    "It reached its nadir, in my view, when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, so obsessed with becoming speaker of the House at any cost, actually lied about telling the truth.",
    "House Democrats also sullied one of Bidens most important bipartisan achievements  a giant infrastructure bill  by making it hostage to other excessive spending demands.",
    "Its the reason he decided to run in the first place, because he knows that without some basic unity of purpose and willingness to compromise, nothing else is possible.",
    "My formative experience in journalism was watching Lebanese politicians go there in the late 1970s and plunge their frail democracy into protracted civil war.",
    "Not when people like Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano  an election denier who marched with the Jan. 6 crowd at the Capitol  just won the G.O.P.",
    "Bush helped manage the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany, without firing a shot or the loss of a single American life.",
    "Under pressure to revive the economy, and facing big-ticket demands from the far left, Biden pursued expansive spending for too long.",
    "But we may not be able to get even 1 percent of Republicans to shift if far-left Democrats are seen as defining the partys future.",
    "I am talking about our ability to transfer power peacefully and legitimately, an ability we have demonstrated since our founding.",
    "Thus, their top priority is installing candidates whose primary allegiance is to Trump and his Big Lie  not to the Constitution.",

    "And that is why I left my lunch with the president with a full stomach but a heavy heart.",
    "The peaceful, legitimate transfer of power is the keystone of American democracy.",
    "And once we break it, it will be gone  and we may never be able to get it back.",
    "Nevertheless, they are ready to hitch a ride on the Trump train to gain power.",
    "Who in your life have you ever encountered who lied about telling the truth?",
    "The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.",
