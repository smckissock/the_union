    "NBC added, \"Though Trumps press shop had already written up an endorsement of Vance, a source close to Mandels campaign said Thursday that it threw up a last-minute obstacle for the former president to consider: an internal Republican poll conducted by Mandels campaign showing that, with Trumps endorsement, its candidate would be in front with 33 percent of the vote, followed by Matt Dolan and Mike Gibbons tied at 15 percent, with Vance and Timken both at 9 percent.\"",
    "According to Swan of Axios, \"Trump, who puts a ton of stock in debates, was impressed with Vances performances  and thought Mandel was embarrassing,\" adding, \"Trump was soured by clips of a near-physical debate altercation last month between Mandel and another rival, investment banker Mike Gibbons.\"",
    "Trump's endorsement of the \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author, who has been highly critical of the former president in the past, caught many by surprise with NBC reporting \"The Mandel people hit the roof,\" upon being given advance notice and that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) tried to talk Trump out of it.",
    "Add to that, Trump didn't like how Mandel came off during his TV appearances -- a death blow for any candidate seeking the twice-impeached former president's support.",
    "The report adds that Trump also thinks Vance \"has the look\" of a candidate and \"has been impressed with his appearances with Tucker Carlson.\"",
    "According to Jonathan Swan of Axios, Donald Trump decided to throw his endorsement for the GOP Ohio U.S. Senate nomination to author J.D.",
    "However, the former president was not deterred with Axios reporting Don Trump Jr. was pushing for Vance.",
    "Vance because he thinks the alternative, former Ohio treasurer Josh Mandel, is \"embarrassing.\""
