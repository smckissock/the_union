    "Stefanik, meanwhile, declared in ads last September that Democrats would legalize undocumented immigrants in a PERMANENT ELECTION INSURRECTION.? Thats a vile replacement trope pushed by the No.",
    "So it is that the New York lawmaker is lashing out at critics who have noted her flirtation with great replacement theory? in the wake of the horrific racist shooting in her home state.",
