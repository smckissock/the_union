    "Just In...\nDELAWARE, OHIO  Republican Senate candidate Mike Gibbons told the Washington Examiner on Friday that he remains optimistic about his chances in the Republican primary despite former President Donald Trumps endorsement of one of his rivals, author J.D.",
    "If you're standing in front of 600 people, somebody gets in with the microphone, answering a question, and somebody gets up in your face, what do you do?? Gibbons asked, adding that he did not feel particularly at risk but was unsure how to respond.",
    "We still think we have a trajectory.?\nTrumps endorsement of Vance was controversial among even some of his staunchest supporters, with some pointing to critical remarks Vance made about Trump and his supporters during his 2016 campaign.",
    "The crowded field of candidates in Ohios Republican primary, in which the winner will enter a general election crucial to the Republicans' efforts to win a majority, spent much of the primary seeking Trumps endorsement.",
    "Asked how much weight he thinks Trumps endorsement will carry with voters, Gibbons said that he likes Trump personally and had a good conversation? with the former president about his campaign.",
    "Asked about his path to success in the primary, Gibbons argued that voters are tired of celebrities that come out of nowhere? and that he is a businessman and not a politician.",
    "The Washington Examiner spoke with several Ohio Republican voters this week who expressed discouragement with the contentious Republican primary and negative television ads.",
    "We havent changed our plans,? Gibbons said at a campaign stop in Delaware, Ohio, adjacent to a rally where Trump included Vance in the speaker line-up.",
    "And I personally think this is one of them.?\nGibbons said he doesnt know why Trump made the endorsement, and we'll see what happens.\"",
    "Asked how he would respond to those voters, Gibbons pointed to rival Josh Mandels decision to get in his face at a candidate forum.",
    "As Trump selected Vance, who had previously been lagging in polls, the other candidates shifted their approach to the race.",
    "I got tired of throwing things in my television set as much as those people have.?\nThe state's primary is May 3.",
    "Even though I wasn't at fault, I am still embarrassed by the fact that I was even involved,? Gibbons said.",
    "But a lot of people, rightfully so, look at what he did with the Trump agenda, what he accomplished.",
    "They also recognized that he made a lot of bad decisions when it came to picking people.",
    "He argued the voters of Ohio would ultimately make their decision.",
    "It just added a different dimension to the race,? Gibbons said.",
    "But I think everybody looks at him differently,? Gibbons said.",
    "I never even considered running for office,? he said.",
    "Vance."
