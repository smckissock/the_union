    "As the GOP primaries accelerate in the coming weeks, several Republican Senators told The Hill the party could still screw up what they view as an advantageous political environment.?\nThe concern is both an echo from previous cycles, where Republicans feel they got burned at the ballot box because less-electable candidates won a primary and a recognition that with a 50-50 Senate, any one race could make-or-break who wins the majority,? noted The Hill.",
    "I think most of the Republicans would rather have Donald Trumps endorsement than not  but its a lot of factors, people are paying attention.?\nDespite the fears, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is largely optimistic, believing the election atmosphere is actually better than it was in 1994? when Republicans swept the mid-terms to take back the House.",
    "Weve shown our ability to do that and thats why its important as always to nominate people who can win general elections, and it remains to be seen.?\nThe big test this coming mid-term will be former President Donald Trumps kingmaker status depending on how well his endorsed candidates perform in both the primaries and the general election.",
    "Trump endorsed Katie Arrington, one of his early supporters and former national security officials, for Congress in South Carolina to oust establishment Republican Rep. Nancy Mace in the states 1st district.",
    "While Republicans have not exactly warmed to Pennsylvania Senate candidate Mehmet Oz due to his left-leaning past, Trumps endorsement has helped put him in the lead by a razor-thin margin of three points.",
    "https://t.co/fKcoegYVrd\n Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 10, 2022\nFor the most part, in every primary race, the Trump-endorsed candidate has shot to the front of the pack, as in the case of J.D.",
    "And weve had some experience with that in the past.?\nIn the Senate, if you look at where we have to compete in order to get into a majority, there are places that are competitive in the general election.",
    "Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) concurred that GOP should perform strong this coming November so long as the party doesnt screw up the primaries.?\nWeve been there before,? said Cornyn.",
    "[There] are some very contentious, competitive primaries and in states, swing states, in a general election where youve got to have good candidates,? Thune said.",
    "Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said Republicans would have a higher than 50 percent chance of recapturing the Senate if the primaries were over.",
    "Senate Republicans have warned primary voters to select the best candidates if they hope to win House and Senate this coming November.",
    "From an atmospheric point of view, its a perfect storm of problems for the Democrats,? McConnell said.",
    "So you cant nominate somebody whos just sort of unacceptable to a broader group of people and win.",
    "It would be a lot higher than 50-50 if the primaries were over and we knew who our nominees were.",
    "Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) told The Hill that Trumps influence will be on a case-by-case basis.",
    "We had that experience in 2010 and 2012,? McConnell added.",
    "It will be in some and not the others,? said Cramer.",
    "It looks like the [former] president has given J.D.",
    "Well see how long that lasts,? Cornyn said.",
    "Vance a little bit of a bump.",
    "How could you screw this up?",
    "Its actually possible.",
    "Vance in Ohio."
