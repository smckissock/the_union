    "“Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine and invasion of its territory must be met with strong American resolve,” he declared, calling for Biden to “sanction Russian energy production to a halt,” and “help arm the Ukrainians to defend themselves.”\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who had earlier blamed Biden’s “weakness” for the invasion made it clear Thursday that he thought that “There is only one group of people responsible for the tragedies unfolding — Vladimir Putin and his cronies.”\n“Europe must act with strength and resolve to prevent risking a wider conflict,” Johnson said “and the U.S. must support our NATO allies and freedom-loving people in this moment of extreme peril.”\nEven the uber-Trumpy Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) issued a statement denouncing what she called “an unwarranted and unjustified invasion by a gutless, bloodthirsty, authoritarian dictator.”\nBoth in tone and substance the GOP reaction was in sharp contrast to Donald Trump’s lavish praise of Putin as a savvy “genius.” Even as the invasion unfolded, Trump lauded the Russian autocrat as “smart” because he’s “taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions.”\nTo the unwary, this could look like the Big One — an issue that would finally split the GOP from Trump.",
    "The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser was struck by how much of the born-again hawkishness among Republicans was “gaslighting,” after “literally enabling a pro-Putin president for four years and refusing to stop him even when he literally blackmailed Ukraine with millions in security aid to help Ukraine fight Russia.”\nAttorney George Conway noted Stefanik had risen to GOP leadership and “made herself famous for her mendacity in opposing the impeachment of the guy who attempted to extort Ukraine by illegally withholding security assistance funds that Congress had appropriated for that country.”\nEven as congressional Republicans accuse Biden of being insufficiently harsh toward Putin, Trumpist figures in the entertainment wing of the GOP came to Putin’s defense.",
    "National Review editor Rich Lowry — a harsh critic of Putin — nevertheless tweeted that “The sheer unpredictably of Trump, his anger at being defied or disrespected, his willingness to take the occasional big risk (the Soleimani strike), all had to make Putin frightened or wary of him in a way that he simply isn’t of Joe Biden.”\nThis is a genuinely bizarre take, given Trump’s fawning admiration for Putin and his praise of the invasion.",
    "Longtime Trumpist consigliere and trickster Roger Stone has also taken to repeating Russian talking points, and insisted Thursday that “Biden wants war more than the Ukrainians want war.” Trumpist rock star Charlie Kirk told his millions of followers that “it feels as if Putin is going into places that want him.” (The Ukrainian people would like a word.)",
    "This would seem to support Rothman’s argument that the pro-Russian voices on the right “are talking only to a small clique that is utterly unrepresentative of the American right.” But this assumes that the views of those voters are firmly held and not subject to the rapid evolution of Republican views that we have seen on other issues.",
    "He cites a CBS/YouGov survey from June 2021 that found that 62 percent of Republicans see Putin as either “unfriendly” or “an enemy.” A more recent Quinnipiac University poll found that a similar percentage of Republicans (63 percent) thought that Russia posed military threats to the United States.",
    "And the influence of that entertainment wing is magnified by the ascendency of the America First isolationism championed by Donald Trump, whose dominance in the GOP has meant the virtual eclipse of the party’s once robust internationalist wing.",
    "The latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 50 percent of voters said that Biden would be “very” or “somewhat” responsible for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while 34 percent said he was “not too” or “not” responsible.",
    "He also cites a CBS News/YouGov survey from earlier this month that found that 41 percent of GOP voters said they backed Ukraine in the current crisis, compared with only 9 percent who said they supported Russia.",
    "Vance, the Ukraine-indifferent Ohio Senate candidate whose border obsessions are entirely domestic and whose rallying cry is “Build that wall.”\nThe animus of the right has been turned inward.",
    "The reality is that, despite Tom Cotton’s saber-rattling, there is really no longer any appetite among Republicans for a Reagan-esque tear-down-that wall approach to foreign policy.",
    "On the first day of the red-meat Republican event, only hours after Russian bombs had begun to rain on Ukrainian cities, the condemnation of Putin was in notably short supply.",
    "Ron DeSantis had time in his welcoming speech to assail the autocracies in Canada and Australia but not the one sending tanks across the border of an independent nation.",
    "In part, that explains the weird flex that ignores Trump’s long record of Putin appeasement to argue that it was only his departure that emboldened Russian aggression.",
    "But his cry for “freedom” loses some of its luster when the CPAC organizers found room on the same stage for Putin-apologist and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.",
    "So, the Putin-is-a-savvy-genius wing of the party may be small at the moment, but as we have seen over and over, the MAGA voices are the Republican id these days.",
    "“There is not a minute to lose.”\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who had earlier suggested giving in to Russian demands to exclude Ukraine from NATO, pivoted hard.",
    "A casual observer might have heard echoes of the party of Reagan, a party that used to stand firmly against autocracy and Russian imperialism.",

    "As I’ve said for month — NATO (under direction from the United States) is violating previous agreements and expanding eastward.",

    "So, whatever happens, Republicans will be united in their opposition to whatever Joe Biden does or fails to do.",

    "The same poll found that 82 percent of Republicans disapprove of Biden’s handling of foreign policy.",
    "Does he eat dogs?”\nOther voices from the MAGAverse have gone further in exonerating Putin of blame.",
