    "When he first ran for Congress in 2002, Ryans campaign highlighted his anti-abortion bona fides, and in 2009, he penned an op-ed acknowledging that he is a pro-life member of Congress.?\nIn Congress, Ryan supported pro-life legislation like the 2003 Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act  which blocked abortions in military medical facilities that are federally funded  and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which was, as Ryan plainly stated: against partial-birth abortion, and against human cloning.?\nRyan even joined a pro-choice colleague,? Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), to introduce Preventing Unintended Pregnancies, Reducing the Need for Abortion, and Supporting Parents Act, with the goal of offering common-ground policy solutions to reduce abortions by addressing the root causes.?\nThe congressman explained his pro-life position to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who was also Speaker at the time, to firmly say that any healthcare reform should prohibit public funds from paying for abortions.?\nIn 2015, Ryan detailed his flip-flop on the abortion issue in an op-ed titled Why I changed my thinking on abortion,? where he explained that after nearly 15 years in office, he would now be pro-abortion after speaking to women and having a child of his own.",
    "He proudly voted for the measure this past year, calling the deaths of these children reproductive health.?\nAs summarized by the Catholic News Agency:\nThe WHPA would prohibit abortion restrictions or bans that are more burdensome than those restrictions imposed on medically comparable procedures, do not significantly advance reproductive health or the safety of abortion services, and make abortion services more difficult to access.?\nThe acts text lists a series of specific restrictions it would do away with, on everything from limitations on telemedicine to restrictions around viability, which the act defines as the point when a fetus can survive outside the womb  determined by the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider.?\nThe Senate hopeful also supports having the taxpayers foot the bill for abortions.",
    "His statement claimed that the decision by the Supreme Court, if true, is absolutely wrong.?\nThe statement also indicated that the Democrat-controlled Senate should end the filibuster? in order to force through the Womens Health Protection Act which would codify Roe and protect abortion rights from attacks at the state and local level?:\nOverturning Roe v. Wade would be absolutely wrong, not to mention catastrophic for Ohio, where Republicans have passed one extreme and dangerous proposal after another to ban abortion- without exceptions even for rape.",
    "Ryan endorsed the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act,? which would reverse the Hyde Amendment and allow anyone who receives health care or insurance from the federal government  such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Veterans Administration  to have coverage for abortions.",
    "Control of the Senate has never been more important: its time to end the filibuster, pass the Womens Health Protection Act, and fight like hell to make sure all Ohio families are free to make these critical decisions without interference from politicians in Columbus or Washington.",
    "I have come to believe that we must trust women and families  not politicians  to make the best decision for their lives.?\nThe now-pro-abortion Ryan, however, only more recently embraced the more radical side of his partys advocacy for killing unborn Americans.",
    "The congressmans new stance is to support late-term abortion  up until the moment of birth  which is a key tenet of the Womens Health Protection Act,? an extreme federal takeover of abortion regulation of which Ryan is an original cosponsor.",
    "The abortion views of Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), the Democrat nominee for Ohios open U.S. Senate race, have devolved alongside his party in the past decade, switching from being a pro-life advocate to a radical proponent of abortion-on-demand.",
    "Ryan wanted to push his extremist views on abortion further following the release of a leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn the infamous pro-abortion case Roe v. Wade.",
    "The ten-term congressman and failed presidential hopeful spent a good chunk of his career in Congress advocating for the unborn, voting on bills that would protect children in the womb.",
    "Heres Kamala Harris stooge Tim Ryan defending abortion through 40 weeks,? Vance said in response to a clip of the congressman speaking to Bret Baier on Fox News on Wednesday.",
    "I would be abandoning my own conscience and judgment if I held a position that I no longer believed appropriate,? he wrote.",
    "But its an especially radical position in Ohio.?\nHeres Kamala Harris stooge Tim Ryan defending abortion through 40 weeks.",
    "This is a barbaric position anywhere in the world (even European nations typically dont allow abortion after 12 weeks).",
    "This is a barbaric position anywhere in the world (even European nations typically dont allow abortion after 12 weeks).",
    "Vance hammered Ryan for saying women should be able to abort an unborn child at any point in the pregnancy.",
