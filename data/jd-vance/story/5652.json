    "I think a lot of the most interesting political dynamics are going to be out in the states, and especially, say, in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, where you have a Democratic governor and a Republican legislature, and just a few votes in that legislature is  it's going to make the difference of whether the governor can veto these anti-abortion bills that are coming through.",
    "New York Times columnist David Brooks and Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty join Judy Woodruff to discuss the week in politics, including the latest developments from the U.S. Supreme Court leaks, culture wars, what early primary election results could mean for this year's midterms and the war in Ukraine.",
    "And sort of seeing how those races play out, where you have a Trump contender and a vigorously anti-Trump contender, or at least one that the president believes  the former president believes is anti-Trump on the ballot, next to each other, those are going to be, I think, better tests.",
    "David Brooks:\nIt's hard to know, because, while clear majority support Roe, a clear majority oppose abortions  or support abortion restrictions after the first trimester, and a really large majority oppose  or support restrictions in the second trimester.",
    "And so you could say, should we support Roe, but then, if it goes back to the voters in the state legislatures, and they start acting, in theory, in my ideal world, in PBS world, it goes back to the voters, and the majority is sort of in the middle there.",
    "David, does this make  and, by the way, we should say, Clarence Thomas, Justice Thomas, gave  spoke today at a judicial conference, in which he said the court is not going to be bullied, no matter what people think about what was leaked this week.",
    "And then what's interesting in Washington is, we really could see, when parties get control over Congress, and they decide to throw out the filibuster, we could see the federal government swinging wildly from one abortion regime to another.",
    "David Brooks:\nAnd so, the effects of this, I don't  don't think it'll be huge in the midterms, but I think it could be  potentially be very huge five years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, in ways that are really hard to see.",
    "But the kind of norm-breaking ideological warfare that it took for somebody to actually leak the draft of an opinion written back in February, I think it just shows that the court has become yet another political branch of government.",
    "We talked a little bit about the midterms, but let's talk about, in the run-up to the midterms, David, in Ohio, you're seeing the primary elections take place, President Trump, former President Trump, weighing in.",
    "Karen Tumulty:\nEven as the culture wars have raged around this issue, public opinion about abortion, and specifically about Roe v. Wade, has been very, very stable over the years, over the decades.",
    "Karen Tumulty:\nThe real question is whether this again, lights a fire under Democrats, and particularly the ones who are really hard to get to the polls in a midterm, young voters, single women.",
    "So  but if you had asked people like me in 1973, what's going to be the effect of Roe v. Wade, a big culture war, Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, believe me, that would not have occurred to us.",
    "Karen Tumulty:\nI do think that, in terms of, is it going to make the Republican base more energized, it would be really hard for the Republican base to be any more energized than it is.",
    "Karen Tumulty:\nAlthough I  in terms of the election that's right in front of us now, I do think that we love to fixate on whether Congress, the control of Congress, is going to shift.",
    "What the pro-life people say, in my view, after about the 22nd week, if you look at the science of what a fetus is doing, it's a lot of humanlike activity.",
    "And in\nDavid Brooks:\nBoth  I think the  what Hillary Clinton said about what happens to women, and they're dangerous, that's a very powerful argument.",
    "And so I would say it becomes a bit delegitimized, when every Republican appointee votes one way and every Democratic appointee votes the other way.",
    "But  so I think they just had different flavors of Trumpism mostly on the\n(CROSSTALK)\nJudy Woodruff:\nBut do you see, Karen, this  what does it say?",
    "We know Trump is putting his weight heavily on one of the candidates, Mehmet Oz, in Pennsylvania, on his favorite candidate, Perdue, in Georgia.",
    "I was at a Freedom House dinner with a Ukrainian activist, and just the conviction and fervor, that she said: \"We're not here to negotiate.",
    "Karen Tumulty:\nBut I do think the court as an institution suffered a very serious blow this week by the leaking of this draft opinion.",
    "And so I think the most likely outcome is that the red states go radically one way and the blue states go radically the other way.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nAnd then the question is, what does the U.S., what does NATO do in response if he does something unthinkable?",
    "David Brooks:\nYes, I agreed with Hillary Clinton's sentiments on that, though, a graceful exit, I'm not sure I see coming.",
    "It's  and then law professors, even very pro-choice law professors, have always said, we're worried about this decision.",
    "And so, if we had a good democracy, we would wind up where Europe is, where they say, there are strong arguments here.",
    "We at The Post had a poll just a few days ago, where it was 54 percent in favor of Roe v. Wade vs. 27 percent against.",
    "No, and he shifted over because, in those  it hadn't become the culture war landscape that we now are familiar with.",
    "I mean, we have  we have seen Justice Breyer and others out there making speeches about the legitimacy of the court.",
    "Karen Tumulty:\nI think it's still an open question whether Vladimir Putin in a corner is less or more dangerous.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nWell, a lot  and a lot of investigative work being done right now to figure out how it leaked.",
    "So I think, by and large, people do generally want abortion to be available in the early part of pregnancy.",
    "This guy Matt Dolan, who sort of ran against  is sort of a non-Trumpy, he did  he certainly did very well.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nBut, I mean, to David's point, Karen, the country is already so deeply divided, polarized.",
    "That is New York Times columnist David Brooks, and Karen Tumulty, columnist for The Washington Post.",
    "Yes, we have gotten leaks of which way a decision is going to go in the past, including Roe v. Wade.",
    "What does that say, if anything, about the former president's ability to sway these races coming up?",
    "I looked at the resolutions the Southern Baptist Convention was passing around then about abortion.",
    "And that, I do think, is potentially kind of light a fire under people who support abortion rights.",
    "And so hanging all that on that decision was always going to be  it was  it was waiting to go off.",
    "And especially it is going to be  it is going to be Georgia, where the governor is on the ballot.",
    "I think Vladimir Putin, when he feels like he has nothing to lose, could be very dangerous still.",
    "But it's just been another week of slow, grinding, but somewhat progress for the Ukrainian side.",
    "I think the  but you  conservatives think that it was delegitimized when Roe v. Wade happened.",
    "And I happen to think this is an issue on which both sides have extremely powerful arguments.",
    "I mean, how much should we be worried about what Putin's reaction is going to be if he loses?",
    "And so that means 70 or 68 percent of Republicans in Ohio voted against the Trump candidate.",
    "And that, in an ideal world, is what happens if it goes back to the state legislatures.",
    "We heard, David, Hillary Clinton, focus on Vladimir Putin and say he's been humiliated.",
    "When the Supreme Court made the Roe v. Wade decision, we didn't have a culture war yet.",
    "So, all the culture war that we had, that was really partly kicked off by Roe v. Wade.",
    "Read the Full Transcript\nJudy Woodruff:\nAnd now to the analysis of Brooks and Tumulty.",
    "And then you had the pro-life movement, which shifted over onto the Republican side.",
    "And, in my view, Ronald Reagan would not have been elected without pro-life voters.",
    "And you can think the Constitution doesn't guarantee it, but people should have it.",
    "And they said, we have got a long way to go before that  we  that's a big concern.",
    "There is a lot that's gone on in the last few days that we are here to talk about.",
    "And Mike DeWine, the governor, who Trump really dislikes, he cruises to victory.",
    "It wasn't a majority, but he did win the Republican nomination for the Senate.",
    "We have to remember, what, two-thirds of the country wasn't even born in 1973.",
    "And so I just think that there's a sense that he really is being pushed back.",
    "And I have asked experts about, should we really worried about getting nuked?",
    "Karen Tumulty:\nThose are going to be the more interesting primaries, I think.",
    "David, we're now, what, four days out from this leak from the Supreme Court.",
    "I mean, Louisiana is talking about criminalizing it for the pregnant woman.",
    "A lot of people are reading about what's going to happen in the future.",
    "That's somewhere the pro-life movement has never really gone before.",
    "I mean, does it look like he's going to be able to get who he wants?",
    "He is public enemy number one, as far as Donald Trump is concerned.",
    "I mean, does this  doesn't this punctuate what the differences are?",
    "They were allowing a lot of loopholes for people to have abortions.",
    "We see the Europeans go even harder on getting rid of Russian oil.",
    "Donald Trump would not have been elected without pro-life voters.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nAnd it might make a difference, but we don't know.",
    "The last thing I want to ask the two of you is the court itself.",
    "We  it looks like he's going to have to find some graceful exit.",

    "Vance was at about 23 percent support before the endorsement.",
    "They want some restrictions, but not all the way through.",
    "Karen Tumulty, David Brooks, so much going on right now.",
    "And I  personally, there are two separate issues here.",
    "And there's no gender gap particularly on this issue.",
    "And Ruth Bader Ginsburg made this point back in 1992.",
    "Should abortion be a right that people get to enjoy?",
    "Should  does the Constitution guarantee that right?",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nLast quick question for both of you.",
    "They don't want the court to be seen as political.",
    "It's similar to the fury you saw in Bush v. Gore.",
    "That decision was so big, she said it's fragile.",
    "Women and men are more or less in the same camp.",
    "And it's important to separate those two things.",
    "And I'm not sure we live in that world anymore.",
    "And so, in our ideal world, we have a debate.",
    "David Brooks:\nYes, maybe an eight-point jump.",
    "And so both sides have powerful arguments.",
    "Let's try to find some way to reconcile.",
    "I would be a little humbled about that.",
    "David Brooks:\nWell, first, I'm humbled.",

    "I don't know the answer to that.",
    "This makes it worse, doesn't it?",
    "They are worried about decision.",
    "They were supporting abortions.",
    "But it is Donald Trump's party.",

    "His candidate in Ohio, J.D.",
    "Vance, did come out on top.",
    "They were pretty moderate.",
    "It's not a great decision.",
