    "But when he bad-mouthed us, the voters, that pissed me off.?\nMr. Vance, for his part, pressed his attack on Mr. Mandel, who had vied for the former presidents endorsement with ads calling himself pro-God, pro-gun, pro-Trump.? Mr. Vances spokeswoman, Taylor Van Kirk, called Mr. Mandel a phony, fraud and sellout, who claims to be anti-establishment in public, but throws President Trump and the entire MAGA movement under the bus to the establishment behind closed doors.?\nIn turn, the one Republican who has said the party needs to move on from the former president, State Senator Matt Dolan, castigated Mr. Vance for bringing members of the partys extremist wing, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, into the state on Saturday  not because of their extreme positions, but because they are outsiders? who are telling Ohioans how they should vote.?\nIn the rush to the right, Mr. Gibbons, who had styled himself a businessman in Mr. Trumps mold and was once the front-runner in the Senate contest, pledged his fealty to a right-wing movement, called the Convention of States, to rewrite the Constitution to restrain federal power.",
    "A pro-Vance super PAC, heavily funded by Peter Thiel, the Trump-aligned financier that Mr. Vance works for, fired back Friday with an ad running in Columbus, Dayton and Cleveland that portrays Mr. Mandel as a squish.? Mr. Mandels embrace by the Republican nominees for the presidency in 2008 and 2012, John McCain and Mitt Romney, are treated in the advertisement like a scarlet letter, and kind words from Mr. Kasich might as well have come from Nancy Pelosi.",
    "Josh Mandel: Another failed career politician squish,? a new ad from a super PAC supporting Mr. Vance blared on Ohio television sets on Friday, calling Mr. Mandel, who is mounting his third Senate run, a two-time loser? and a moderate for the moderates.?\nAfter so much vitriol, Ohios primary will begin to shed light on just how much power the former president can still wield from his exile.",
    "Ohio used to be known for the quiet conservatism of the states celebrated former senator George Voinovich and its current governor, Mike DeWine; for the Merlot-swilling happy-warrior days of the former House speaker John A. Boehner; for the moderation of John Kasich, a two-term governor; and for the free-trade, free-market ideology of Mr. Portman himself.",
    "The former presidents attacks did chase the one Ohio Republican who voted to impeach him, Representative Anthony Gonzalez, into retirement, and he buoyed a former White House aide, Max Miller, who is running for an Ohio House seat, despite an accusation from one of Mr. Trumps press secretaries, Stephanie Grisham, that he had physically abused her.",
    "In a series of statements on Friday seemingly issued to appeal to the far right, Mr. Gibbons declared that a dire need of real change? meant he would support a convention to rewrite the Constitution, and said that a new effort by the Department of Homeland Security to combat disinformation would be a de facto Ministry of Truth? to crush dissent.",
    "COLUMBUS, Ohio  Republicans running for the seat of Ohios retiring senator, Rob Portman, appear determined to bury the soft-spoken country-club bonhomie that was once a hallmark of the party in this state, and replace it with the pugilistic brand of conservatism owned by Donald J. Trump and now amplified by the new band of Buckeye bomb throwers.",
    "But in other contests, such as a heated Republican primary in northwest Ohio, mainstream Republicans are expected to prevail against conservative showmen like J.R. Majewski, who painted his vast backyard into a 19,000-square-foot Trump election sign and posted a video of himself walking through a shuttered factory with an assault-style rifle.",

    "Instead, affections for such Ohio leaders are now being weaponized  in broadsides from the candidates and advertisements by their allies  as evidence that rivals are paying only lip service to Mr. Trump and his angry populism.",
    "He still motivates our base in a way that some people think is waning, but its not from my perspective.?\nStill, to call Tuesdays Republican primary a referendum on the future of Trumpism  in Ohio and beyond  would go too far.",
