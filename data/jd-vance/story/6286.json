    "On Monday, Democratic Georgia state Rep. Josh McLaurin, Vance's old college roommate, tweeted what he said was a message he received from Vance, who expressed concern that Trump might be Americas Hitler.?\nI go back and forth between thinking Trump might be a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldnt be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he might be Americas Hitler,? Vance wrote, according to McLaurin's tweet.",
    "Clearly, President Trump trusts that JD is a genuine convert, as out of all the Republican candidates running, he endorsed JD and concluded that he is the strongest America First conservative in the race,? Wiggins added, The Washington Times reported.",
    "Its laughable that the media treats JD not liking Trump 6 years ago as some sort of breaking news, when theyve already covered it to death since this race began,? campaign manager Jordan Wiggins told conservative outlet The Washington Times.",
    "Of course, the issue here isnt merely that Vance didnt like Trump, but that he apparently acknowledged Trumps similarities to a genocidal Nazi who killed millions  and now supports Trump regardless.",
    "Vance had a well-established record of bashing Donald Trump before ultimately groveling for  and winning  the former president's endorsement in the upcoming Republican U.S. Senate primary in Ohio.",
    "Hows that for discouraging??\nVance previously used words like idiot,? noxious? and reprehensible? to describe Trump  but that was before he sought the former president's endorsement.",
    "And as a Trump loyalist now, maybe he pictures himself as Americas equivalent of a brownshirt  a soldier picked to carry out Trumps violent, antidemocratic vision for the nation.",
    "Its always helpful when Trump World figures and their associates use cultish language  like convert?  to expose their sheepish ways.",
    "But an unearthed Facebook message from 2016 shows just how shameless Vances pivot from Trump skeptic to sycophant has truly been.",
    "That said, neither Vance nor his team have denounced the comparison between Trump and Hitler.",
    "Hes since deleted his tweets criticizing Trump and said he regrets speaking ill of him.",
    "Vances team quickly went into damage control following McLaurin's tweet Monday.",
    "Maybe he still thinks its accurate.",
    "J.D."
