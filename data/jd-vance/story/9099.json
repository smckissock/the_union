    "My statement on President Trumps endorsement: pic.twitter.com/abjDitwCS5\n Jim Lamon (@jim_lamon) June 2, 2022\nThen, after that several paragraphs long statement, Lamon released the first of two attack ads against Mastersfalsely claiming that Masters is antisemitic:\nThe ad drew a quick rebuke from across the GOP spectrum, with Masters himself releasing a video comparing Lamons actions to tactics employed by leftists and establishment media outfits:\nDesperate opponents like Jim Lamon are resorting to journalist tactics!",
    "#AZSen https://t.co/We2uNXpDtQ\n Arthur Schwartz (@ArthurSchwartz) June 6, 2022\nThen, after the backlash against that first attack ad, instead of accepting that he made a mistake and that Trump had made his selection in Arizona, Lamon tripled down with yet another attack ad bashing Masters for having the support of Peter Thiel:\nWhile Blake Masters is busy trying to downplay the controversial statements hes written, said, or shared, I thought it would be a good time to release this new TV ad.",
    "https://t.co/u65isUHX89 pic.twitter.com/bPw9XKnKnW\n Blake Masters (@bgmasters) June 3, 2022\nOthers, like Donald Trump Jr. and other top allies of the former president, rushed in to rip Lamon and defend Masters as well:\nSo disappointing to watch a supposed Republican desperately echo the dishonest smears of the leftwing media to try to tear down @bgmasters.",
    "Vance, with Trumps endorsement and Thiels support, defeated a similarly crowded field to become the GOP nominee for Senate in Ohio and ran a campaign much like the one that Masters is currently running in Arizona  focused on reducing immigration and questioning U.S. intervention in conflicts worldwide.",
    "View it here  pic.twitter.com/jps27Dt48a\n Jim Lamon (@jim_lamon) June 6, 2022\nThiel, it is worth noting, while a former Facebook board member, has been one of the most strident America First donors in the country, whose support was also critical for J.D.",
    "First, in a statement berating the former president for the endorsement and claiming he would win anyway, Lamon said he is especially disappointed in Trump for endorsing the rising GOP star over him.",
    "Lamon is a snake who cant be trusted and thats just one of the many reasons that DJT didnt endorse him (apparently his breath stank like a dead rat when he met DJT  that didnt help either).",
    "Establishment candidate for U.S. Senate Jim Lamon is melting down after former President Donald Trump endorsed his opponent Blake Masters against him in the Arizona GOP primary last week.",
    "The winner of that primary will face incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) in Novembers general election, and this seat could determine majority control of the U.S. Senate.",
    "pic.twitter.com/VBVzPLObiD\nThe ad, paid for by the pro-Masters super PAC Saving Arizona PAC, details Lamons business ties with the Chinese Communist Party.",
    "While these anti-Masters ads are not accurate, one attack ad running in Arizona  against Lamon  does appear to be accurate:\nJust call @jimlamon China Jim.",
    "The chamber is currently split 50-50, so the Democrats, who hold the White House, have the majority because Vice President Kamala Harris cuts the ties.",
    "Borrowing a page from the corrupt Democrat playbook to lie about a fellow Republican won't save your campaign, @jim_lamonShameful!",
    "Republicans need to flip a net one seat back in their direction to retake control of the upper chamber of Congress.",
    "https://t.co/NwoSYPncON\nAs a Jewish American who lost family members in the Holocaust, Im disgusted by @jim_lamon.",
    "His lie only minimizes very real anti-Semitism being spewed by some Democrats on the floor of Congress.",
    "He made a lot of money doing business with the ChiComs and opposed Trump's get tough on China policies.",
    "Much more about this is expected to come out in the coming days and weeks ahead of the Aug. 2 primary.",
    "https://t.co/8uINpj3SOM\nThis @jim_lamon ad is straight out of the dems playbook.",
    "Do you really want to vote for someone for U.S. Senate who will stoop this low?",
    "So he opposed Trump, is pro-China and sold out American workers.",
    "A Republican like this is unfit to be a U.S.",
    "He has a lot of explaining to do.",
    "Take the ad down, Jim.",
    "Vance in Ohio.",
    "Senator."
