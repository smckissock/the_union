    "Thats what happened on the evening of November 3, 2020, when networks started calling states for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who would eventually win 51.3 percent of the popular vote, defeat former President Donald Trump by more than 7 million ballots, flip five states the Democrats had lost in 2016, and secure a 306-232 Electoral College mandate.",

    "The former corporate lawyer, millionaire venture capitalist, and author of a lamentable book, Hillbilly Elegy, said as the French results were beginning to be tabulated Sunday night, I have a buddy in France, and they just had an election there.",

    "France is a multiparty democracy where, in the first round of voting, all views are represented and where the parliament includes an ideological spectrum that ranges from the far left to the far right.",
    "The replacement of the Electoral College with a system that is designed to give the presidency to the candidate who wins the most votes is not the only democratizing aspect of the French system.",
    "In fact, under the French system, its quite likely that the winner of the popular vote in 2000, Democrat Al Gore, would have ultimately won the presidency.",
    "Perhaps Vance, a first-time candidate, is unaware that television networks in the United States conduct exit polls and project winners as well.",
    "France has a universal system for organizing elections, distributing paper ballots, counting them by hand, and then recording the results.",
    "Vance took time out from trivializing Russias murderous assault on Ukraine last week to comment on the presidential election in France.",
    "While Gore and Clinton would have faced runoffs, its likely they would have entered them with the advantage Macron retains in France.",

    "No need for recounts in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin.",
