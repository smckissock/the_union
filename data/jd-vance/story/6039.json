    "Mr. Vance opposed the establishment of a European-led no-fly zone over Ukraine, and has drawn criticism for a statement he made in February in which he said he did not really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.?

    "CLEVELAND  The homestretch of Ohios contentious Republican Senate primary has revealed a party united in its conviction that American values, indeed the nations way of life, are under attack, but divided on whether to embrace a strict isolationism to address its mounting misgivings about global interconnectedness and American leadership abroad.",
    "But the world beyond Mexico may be the brightest dividing line in the Republican Party, with conservatives split on what to do about Russian aggression, how far to distance the United States from its traditional alliances, and above all what to do about China, at once the nations biggest competitor and one of its largest economic partners.",
    "Mr. Vance, who won Mr. Trumps coveted endorsement, has even suggested, with a straight face but no evidence, that President Biden was intentionally allowing fentanyl into the country because of its potential to kill Republican voters, bringing the issue back to his mother, who as a nurse became addicted to pain medication.",
    "Voters dont always have long memories here, especially after a primary campaign, but certainly the anti-China feelings are going to resonate for a long time,? said Paul Beck, a professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University and a longtime Ohio politics watcher.",
    "Ms. Greene railed against the forever wars? started under George W. Bush and talked up what she called the civil war in the G.O.P.,? while Mr. Gaetz blasted the leaders of his own party and said he and Ms. Greene needed backup in Washington  backup that Mr. Vance would provide.",
    "Anger at Mexican criminal organizations that are distributing fentanyl to the north has become particularly salient in a state that has been ground zero for the national opioid crisis and experienced some of the countrys highest overdose rates over the past three years.",
    "The strains reflect the broader splits in a party undergoing something of an identity crisis, with ideological conservatives, the old Republican establishment of big business, and the Trump-inspired newer rank and file all pulling in different directions.",
    "Whoever wins Tuesday will have to deal with those divisions in the coming general election campaign, especially since the presumed Democratic candidate, Representative Tim Ryan, has no qualms about blasting China while backing U.S. involvement elsewhere.",
    "In Port Clinton, where Ms. Timken, Mr. Gibbons and Mr. Dolan all worked the crowd at a Knights of Columbus chicken barbecue lunch, Lisa Slobodzian said she was still sifting through her direct mail and studying the candidates positions.",
    "And Mr. Gibbons embraced a fringe movement to hold a constitutional convention aimed at curbing federal power, and mocked the Department of Homeland Securitys new effort to counter disinformation as an Orwellian Ministry of Truth.",
    "And then improve our legal immigration.?\nPerhaps the most glaring examples in Ohio of the forces warring within the Republican Party have unfolded over competition with China, the war in Ukraine and American leadership abroad.",
    "And Mr. Cruz, like Republican congressional leaders, has shied away from some of Mr. Trumps broader attacks on corporate America  especially the pharmaceutical industry  which often echoed Democratic talking points.",
    "At the same time, Republicans have been searching for ways to relate to former President Donald J. Trump himself: a few by taking tentative steps away from him, others by falling in line with him wholeheartedly.",
