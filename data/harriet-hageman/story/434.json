    "The governor has not yet announced if he'll sign or veto the proposals, though he put out a statement saying, I remain adamant that the maps should reflect the growth of the African American population in our state over the last 10 years, allowing for minority groups to have an opportunity at electing candidates of their own choosing, and I do have concerns that several of the maps do not fulfill that moral and legal requirement.?\nThe biggest question is what will happen with the new congressional map, which maintains the status quo of a single majority Black and heavily Democratic district and five predominantly white and safely red constituencies; African Americans make up about a third of the state's population, but the GOP leadership ignored calls to create a second majority Black seat.",
    "Leading Off\n? NC Redistricting: A three-judge panel has until Feb. 23 to decide whether the new North Carolina congressional and legislative boundaries passed late on Thursday meet the standards the state Supreme Court set when it rejected the GOP's original plans as \"unlawful partisan gerrymanders\" and ordered new ones, and as we'll discuss in this guide to the new(est) congressional map, it remains something of a Republican-friendly gerrymander while still creating several potential battlegrounds.",
    "This is the first time in decades that both parties have settled on a compromise legislative map rather than task the tiebreaking member to choose between competing Democratic- or Republican-drawn boundaries: Monmouth University's Patrick Murray tweets that the last time the tie breaker wasn't needed was in 1971 back when most state senators were still elected to countywide constituencies, a system that was completely abandoned two years later.",
    "? OH-Sen: Former state party chair Jane Timken's new ad features her standing with photos of four of her opponents in the May Republican primary, all of whom are men (only state Sen.

    "Opt in to email updates from Daily Kos Elections\nSponsored by: Daily Kos Elections\nThere is also the light-blue 1st in eastern North Carolina where Rep. G.K. Butterfield is retiring, which joins towns like Greenville, Rocky Mount, and Wilson and would have favored Biden 53-46; this district has the highest African American percentage in the state, though it still has a 49-42 white plurality.",
    "New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams took 12.5% even though Politico reports that he was \"actively working\" to get the requisite quarter of the vote, while Rep. Tom Suozzi did not submit his name for consideration; both of Hochul's opponents can still qualify for the ballot as long as they turn in 15,000 valid signatures by the April 7 filing deadline.",
    "It's extremely rare for a party leader to side against one of their own incumbents, and CNN says McCarthy reached this point after he convinced the nihilistic Freedom Caucus, whose support he'd need to become speaker, that it would be better to concentrate on denying Cheney renomination rather than ejecting her from the Republican conference.",
    "? PA-Gov, PA-06: The Philadelphia Inquirer's Jonathan Tamari tweets that \"a number of prominent Republicans are encouraging\" Guy Ciarrocchi, who is the former president of the Chester County Chamber of Business and Industry, to drop out of the GOP primary for governor in favor of taking on Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan.",
    "? NJ Redistricting: The New Jersey Legislative Apportionment Commission voted 9-2 on Friday to implement a new legislative map to first be used in the 2023 elections, with one Democrat and one Republican (former state Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., who is currently running for Congress) in opposition.",
    "The three GOP naysayers, though, weren't motivated by disgust with partisan or racial gerrymandering: Firment angrily protested that his constituents in Grant Parish would be divided between two seats, while Amedee and Miguez were likewise unhappy that St. Mary and St. Martin parishes would each be split.",
    "Secretary of State Steve Simon says that state law requires a special election primary take place on May 24 with the general election on Aug. 9, which is the same day as the regular statewide primary; the special election will be held under the congressional lines that have been in place for a decade.",
    "Doug Ducey is still keeping everyone guessing about whether or not he'll launch a bid ahead of the April filing deadline, and Politico reports, \"Three people familiar with Ducey's thinking said he is unlikely to enter the crowded Republican Senate primary, but has still not completely ruled it out.\"",
    "? WY-AL: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has joined Donald Trump in backing attorney Harriet Hageman's August primary challenge to Rep. Liz Cheney, who began the 117th Congress as the third-ranking Republican in the leadership but was ousted months after she voted for impeachment.",
    "The Senate's lines, likewise, cleared the upper chamber 27-12 and the House 65-31, with four absent members of each party; five House Republicans rejected the Senate lines, with one member complaining that his hometown was shifted out of a seat he's also been thinking of running for.",
    "However, this map has a surprisingly high number of competitive seats: In an especially good Democratic year, this could potentially turn into a map where each party holds seven districtsor, if absolutely every card gets played right, an outright eight-to-six Democratic majority.",
    "Based on Dave's Redistricting App data for the newly passed map, Democrats start with three very safe Democratic seats: Deborah Ross' 2nd District in Raleigh; the open 4th in Durham and Chapel Hill, where David Price is not seeking re-election; and Alma Adams' 12th in Charlotte.",
    "Governors\n? AK-Gov: While a media report over the summer said that state Sen. Natasha von Imhof was considering an intra-party challenge to Republican incumbent Mike Dunleavy, she said Tuesday that she wouldn't run for anything, including re-election, in 2022.\n? NY-Gov: Gov.",
    "In another case, they sought to shore up Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, a reactionary who has stymied many progressive priorities, against another bid from nurse Lenny Cioe, who held him to a 55-45 win in the 2020 primary, by stripping out turf where Cioe did well.",
    "Five Democrats and four Republicans didn't vote (one safely blue Democratic-held seat is also vacant), so if all the absent members sided with their party's leadership, the GOP would still need to switch two votes in order to implement the map over Edwards' objections.",
    "The Minnesota Reformer first reported that Hagedorn used $110,000 in taxpayer money to pay a company owned by one of his staffers to print constituent mailers, and that his office had also given $340,000 to another firm called Abernathy West for a similar job.",
    "The redistricting bill passed the Senate 27-10, which is one more than the 26 needed to muster a two-thirds supermajority to override an Edwards' veto, but it cleared the House only 64-31six votes below the 70 needed for an override in the 105-seat chamber.",
    "McClatchy's Danielle Battaglia, who is tracking candidate announcements under this map, reports that singer Clay Aiken and Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam have confirmed that they'll continue their campaigns to seek the Democratic nod in the new 4th.",
    "However, while this 50-48 Obama district looked competitive on paper, especially as Team Blue's fortunes continued to suffer nationwide, national Republicans showed little interest in aiding the underfunded Hagedorn against the formidable Walz.",
    "The Republican's allies ran one of the most xenophobic campaigns of the cycle against the Democrat, and the NRCC ran anti-Semitic ad after anti-Semitic ad tying Feehan, who is not Jewish, to philanthropist and Holocaust survivor George Soros.",
    "Kathy Hochul won 86% of the weighted vote at Thursday's state Democratic convention, which both got her the party endorsement and prevented any of her opponents from taking the 25% needed to earn an automatic place on the June primary ballot.",
    "Redistricting\n? FL Redistricting: A state House committee voted along party lines to advance a GOP-drawn congressional map that would create 18 districts that would have gone for Donald Trump and just 10 that would have voted for Joe Biden.",
    "A recent poll from local firm Target-Insyght gave Marlinga a 48-45 lead over Army veteran John James, who was the GOP's two-time Senate candidate, in a hypothetical general election, little changed from the 46-43 edge it found last month.",
    "Hines, who began running for a seat in Congress in January of last year and has self-funded a majority of his campaign, had $397,000 available, while Ellmers had just $9,000 to spend after a few weeks in the race for the struck-down 4th.",
    "Battaglia writes that on the Democratic side, former state Sen. Erica Smith says she's still in to succeed Butterfield: Smith, who had been running for the U.S. Senate until the fall, had $97,000 to spend at the end of the last quarter.",
    "That leaves one other member of the Democratic caucus: Rep. Kathy Manning, who will most likely run in the new 6th District, which covers Greensboro but also rural areas to its south, and would have gone for Trump by a tiny 49.4-49.2.",
    "But this area, which is home to a large working class white electorate, proved to be very amenable to Trump, and his coattails were almost enough to put Hagedorn over the top: Trump carried the 1st 53-38, and Walz only won 50.3-49.7.",
    "? TX-34: Army veteran Ruben Ramirez has earned an endorsement from Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who represents over two-thirds of this new constituency but is running in the neighboring 34th District, in the March 1 Democratic primary.",

    "Republican Rep. David Rouzer represents just over half this new seat, but since he's never had to win in turf this blue, it's possible he'll instead barge into the adjacent 13th in Raleigh's southern suburbs.",
    "Hagedorn's constituency used to be very competitive territory in presidential elections, but Donald Trump carried it 54-44 in 2020 as Hagedorn was winning re-election by a considerably smaller 49-46 spread.",
    "The GOP originally tried to make this seat much more vulnerable to a pickup: Biden won the old 1st 54-45, while the now-defunct GOP map (which renumbered this the 2nd District) dropped his margin to 51-48.",
