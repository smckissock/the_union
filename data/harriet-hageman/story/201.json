    "Though deep-red Wyoming traditionally draws significantly less in campaign contributions than more populous battleground states, Cheney's unrelenting criticism of former President Donald Trump and statements blaming him for the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 have transformed the race for the state's lone U.S. House seat into one of the most closely watched contests of the 2022 midterms.",
    "Cheney, who chaired the Republican House Conference before being ousted from her post last year, has broken her personal fundraising records in five consecutive quarters and has raised more than $10 million throughout the election cycle, her campaign said in a statement.",

    "But the Republican National Committee Cheney in February, effectively opening the door for them to throw their support behind Hageman's challenge.",
    "Given her vote to impeach him and her position on the Jan. 6 House Select Committee, Cheney's seat is among Trump's top 2022 targets.",
    "Hageman, a Cheyenne attorney, raised $1.3 million over the first three months of 2022, her campaign said in a news release Monday.",
    "But they've also expanded her profile and allowed her to build a nationwide fundraising network.",
