    "In the course of one monologue in February, he said that President Joe Biden supports Ukraine because “its leaders once sent millions of dollars to Joe Biden’s family,” and that liberals oppose Putin because they hope the war will cause energy prices to rise: “expensive energy would be good for the many renewable deals their friends and donors are invested in.”\nHe also constantly flirts with the far-right “Great Replacement” theory that immigration is a way of disenfranchising conservative white Americans, most recently saying that the Democratic party’s slogan is “let’s change the population as fast as we can so we never lose an election.”\nLimbaugh had similar targets, but his overall message was that liberals were dumb and didn’t understand the consequences of their ideas.",
    "During the Ottawa trucker convoy, the host of TV’s most-watched cable news show made headlines for telling his Fox News viewers that “there’s no more fearful despot in the world than Justin Trudeau of Canada,” who has turned the country “into a relentlessly punitive surveillance state.”\nIn the past week, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought new scrutiny of Carlson’s history of downplaying Vladimir Putin’s aggression, and his dismissal of Ukraine as a “State Department client state”— not to mention his statements that American liberals are a bigger threat than Putin: “Has Putin ever called me a racist?” he told his viewers to ask themselves.",
    "Young men who live a lot of their lives online may be more worried about being banned or doxxed than about business tax rates, and Carlson has plenty of experience with them: his top writer, Blake Neff, resigned in early 2020 after CNN revealed that he had spent years posting racist content on a message board under a pseudonym (Neff previously worked for a publication Carlson co-founded, The Daily Caller, which had several contributors associated with white nationalism).",
    "“Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?”\nThese are two of the biggest stories since the February 2021 death of Rush Limbaugh, the radio host who virtually invented the modern conservative talk show, and Carlson has clearly become Limbaugh’s successor: Whether we agree with him or are appalled by him, everyone cares what he thinks.",
    "Carlson, who reinvented himself as a Trumpian nationalist conservative in 2016 after less successful hosting gigs on CNN and MSNBC, picks most of the same targets as “The Rush Limbaugh Show,” particularly feminism, diversity, and Democratic politicians, with particular contempt for liberal women like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
    "Carlson briefly allowed that the posts were “wrong” but showed much more passion in denouncing “the ghouls now beating their chest in triumph at the destruction of a young man.” It was a way of reassuring viewers that he has their back, no matter how heinous their views might be.",
    "But when it comes to the established Republican politicians, Carlson spends so much time attacking them — he has called the party’s Senate leader Mitch McConnell “an instrument of the left” — that they don’t yet court his approval as actively as they did Limbaugh’s.",
    "Carlson engages in his share of mockery and insults (he likes to belittle Occasio-Cortez by calling her “Sandy”), but his show is built around indignant, serious monologues where he portrays liberals as power-hungry, malevolent and even frightening figures.",
    "Another reason Carlson spends less time on attacking government is that he is obsessed with the threat of deplatforming and “cancellation,” which in the U.S. and Canada are usually done by private business rather than governments.",
    "While Carlson would never advocate for universal health care or anything else that his audience associates with socialism, he likes to mock the Republican obsession with tax cuts and limited government.",
    "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Carlson won some mainstream media praise for taking the disease seriously and was even credited with convincing then-president Donald Trump that the virus was a big deal.",
    "This obsession may explain why Carlson attracts an audience that is a bit younger than Limbaugh’s, with Nielsen reporting that Tucker Carlson Tonight even draws more young Democrats than CNN or MSNBC.",
    "Limbaugh could maintain his influence even when Republicans were out of power, but Carlson was at his most influential when Donald Trump was in the White House and watching his show every night.",
    "Limbaugh, like the Republican party in general, deplored “big government” and talked a lot about cutting taxes, regulations, environmental standards, and other restraints on business.",
    "Old-school conservative hosts like Sean Hannity, who hosts the Fox News show after Carlson’s, like to attack liberals as bleeding hearts who don’t understand how the world works.",
    "This vagueness has an upside for him as an entertainer building a larger audience: it allows him to change positions almost randomly, sometimes reversing himself within days.",
    "He constructs most of his monologues around the idea that liberals are trying to enrich themselves, or enhance their power, at the expense of the people who watch his show.",
    "Instead, he worships activist far-right leaders like Victor Orbán in Hungary, whom he recently praised for using tax incentives to encourage higher “native” birth rates.",
    "Carlson has built an entire world view that’s almost like a conservative version of Marxism, with his viewers as the underdogs in a world-historical struggle for power.",
    "With few clear policy goals, he can say whatever will get him a bigger audience; everyone can point to at least one show where he seemingly agreed with them.",
    "More recently, he flip-flopped within days from calling the Ukraine invasion a mere “border dispute” to a slightly more Putin-critical line.",
    "Vance, who gave Carlson his first interview after announcing his Ohio Senate candidacy and often echoes his opinions on issues like Ukraine.",
    "And yet, even as his audience expands, Carlson may not be able to match Limbaugh’s power as a kingmaker within the Republican party.",
    "When Canadian cable companies dropped the Russian state channel RT, Carlson denounced this as another example of Canadian tyranny.",
    "Limbaugh was a radio shock jock who defended some of his more extreme terms (“feminazi”) by claiming he was trying to be funny.",
    "Carlson is almost always on the attack, and rarely talks about what kind of policies he would like to see implemented.",
    "But if you watch enough of Carlson’s shows, or the monologues that go viral on YouTube, his tone is different.",
    "His popularity has had some influence on aspiring Republican politicians, like “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D.",
    "Whenever a news story captures the world’s attention, so does Tucker Carlson’s reaction to the story.",
    "And the differences between the two hosts may give a hint as to how U.S. conservatism is changing.",
    "Not long after, he pivoted to downplaying the virus and, eventually, to downplaying the vaccines.",
    "Until then, at least he knows he can always get attention by calling Justin Trudeau a dictator.",
    "To really challenge Limbaugh for the throne, he may have to hope Trump runs again in 2024.",
    "This view of liberalism demands a conservative government that will hit back even harder.",
    "His implied audience was people who either ran a business or aspired to run one someday.",
    "Carlson thinks Justin Trudeau knows exactly what he’s doing, and it’s evil.",
