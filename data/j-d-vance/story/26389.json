    "Speaking on a hopeful note, Nir said, “If Democrats can somehow hold on to all their vulnerable seats this cycle—it’s not just Georgia and Arizona, but it’s also New Hampshire, it’s also Nevada—and somehow win two more, Joe, you know what that means, right?”\nWith 52 Democratic senators and a Democratic vice president, Sudbay replied confidently that it was “a given” that Democrats would be able to finally bring an end to the filibuster.",
    "Both hail from the western part of the state, so there’s, you know, a lot of votes in Philadelphia, in the eastern part of the state, which creates an interesting sort of dynamic in the primary … Fetterman has been the leader in the polls and in fundraising, but barring a surprise, whoever is the Democratic nominee simply isn’t going to have to worry about tens of millions [of dollars] in attack ads before winning the nomination.",
    "Starting with redistricting, Nir explained that the process hasn’t exactly shaken out as Democrats expected, in a good way:\nA lot of progressives had very good reason to fear what redistricting was going to look like overall because really, as a party, we did not do particularly well downballot in 2020 when all the elections were held for the people who were going to be drawing the new lines.",
    "It is an open seat, and Republicans are probably going to nominate just someone absolutely appalling, but in the end, I don’t see that being enough of a difference maker, given what Ohio’s become.”\nIn North Carolina, in the race for an open Senate seat, Democrats have rallied around former State Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley.",
    "In Pennsylvania, Sen. Pat Toomey announced he would not be running for reelection, leaving an open seat that Nir thinks is the best pickup opportunity for Democrats in the Senate this year:\n[This is great] precisely because it is an open seat, precisely because Pennsylvania does lean a little bit more to the left than Wisconsin.",
    "The two frontrunners appear to be yet another rich guy—this hedge funder, David McCormick, and none other than quack TV doctor Mehmet Oz, who wasn’t even living in Pennsylvania when he first expressed interest in the race, and they have been going at it super hardcore, like I said, spending a fortune on ads.",
    "Moving on to talk about the midterms, Nir pointed out that public sentiment typically turns against the party in power, making this year all the more difficult for Democrats, who currently control the Senate, House, and the White House:\nThe party that controls the White House seldom does well in midterms.",
    "And there we have one of the rare cases of Republicans not facing a bitter, nasty, expensive, contested primary because Donald Trump was so obsessed with former NFL star Herschel Walker that he got behind him quite early on, and no one else of any substance really got into the race.",
    "In that Senate Republican primary, according to Nir,\nDucey decided not to run for reasons that are pretty familiar at this point, because Trump also hates him for the same reasons that he hates Brian Kemp: he wouldn’t help him distort the results in Arizona.",
    "Also, he’s lately come under attack for a rather questionable record in the world of business that his accomplishments seem to not be what he claims they are, and if that’s sounding rather like the guy who endorsed him, well, it’s probably not an accident.",
    "The question is, can he run against this tide that’s coming in right now, and that’s really the million-dollar question.”\nThe pair then turned their focus to Georgia’s gubernatorial election, where Stacey Abrams is challenging incumbent Brian Kemp again.",
    "Despite this all, Nir thinks that Warnock will pull through given his large following and continuously strong fundraising numbers: “Man, the guy has been a monster fundraiser—I think it was $8, $9 million a quarter last year for two quarters in a row.",
    "Given that the U.S. Senate races are shaping up to be very interesting and not as bad as we thought as well, Sudbay asked Nir to drill down into a couple of states—particularly ones in which Democratic senators won in 2020, Georgia and Arizona.",
    "But it’s a two-edged sword: any time Donald Trump likes someone, you have to wonder, ‘Well, what’s wrong with them?’ And the answer with Herschel Walker, the answer is, ‘Quite a lot.’ He has been accused of violent behavior toward women.",
    "This bill is ready to pass as soon as you’re ready to join us, but in the meantime, we’re going to gerrymander the hell out of the states we control if you’re going to do that in the states you control.’ And that’s exactly what they did.",
    "So instead, they have sort of a weird group of candidates that include a couple of rich guys, including a guy who works for Peter Thiel, and they also have the attorney general, Mark Brnovich, and he’s also someone who Trump hates.",
    "In the process, Purdue “has totally turned into a [Trump-lite candidate].” Purdue said that had he been governor in 2020, he wouldn’t have certified the state’s election results—in other words, endorsing GOP election subversion.",
    "“The Ohio Senate GOP primary is actually the nastiest in the entire nation,” he added, pointing out the infighting between characters like former State Treasurer Josh Mandel and venture capitalist J.D.",
    "In Arizona, the current governor, Doug Ducey, who had been heavily recruited by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and even George W. Bush to enter the Senate race, declined to seek the office.",
    "It’s also important to remember the significance of these two states, Nir said: When Biden won Arizona and Georgia, it was the first time since the 1990s that a Democrat had carried them together.",
    "However, he cautioned that Democrats still need to be wary, as just because Republicans put forth a really lousy candidate with a huge number of flaws doesn’t mean they can’t win.",
    "You know, of course we won the Senate, the House, and the White House, but we really didn’t do well on the state legislative level, and that generated a lot of fear.",
    "Nir replied,\nYou know, I have to pinch myself whenever you say something like Senator Raphael Warnock, because I just can’t believe we won that runoff last year.",
    "And there are quite a number of districts in play this year—Republican-held districts that otherwise wouldn’t have been had Democrats not been so aggressive.",
    "But as you noted, Warnock only won a special election for the final two years of the term he’s serving out now, so he has to run for a full six-year term.",
    "Nir believes that Warnock is going to have a very difficult fight until the end, and polling shows that the race is very close, which is confirming that.",
    "And so he knew that getting into the race would mean spending a year of his life having Trump crap on him, day after day, and that just wasn’t worth it.",
    "Pat McCrory—who signed into law the notorious HB 2 anti-trans legislation in 2016—is facing off against Congressman Ted Budd, who was endorsed by Trump.",
    "Nir added that on the Democratic side of that race, Mark Kelly is also an extraordinary fundraiser, which is yet another obstacle for Republicans.",
    "Thirty-four Senate seats, all 435 members of the House, 36 gubernatorial races, and 80 to 90 legislative bodies are up for elections this year.",
    "With an additional two Democratic senators, “a Manchin-proof, Sinema-proof majority” would make the world a very different place, Nir opined.",
    "This week, Daily Kos Political Director David Nir joined Joe Sudbay on The Michelangelo Signorile Show to discuss races to keep a watch on.",
    "Next on the agenda was Ohio, which Nir believes Democrats are unlikely to flip despite having a solid candidate in Congressman Tim Ryan.",
    "Nir broke his analysis down into two pieces, focusing on redistricting and then an overview of the actual midterm races themselves.",
    "And that’s one of a long line in GOP recruitment failures of these popular governors that they’ve failed to get to run for Senate.",
    "Again [...] it’s because he wouldn’t get on board with the Big Lie, so Trump hasn’t really taken sides in that race, I believe.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "In 2020, Kemp certified Georgia’s election results when Joe Biden won the state, but that did not come without consequences.",
    "What will this year’s midterm elections look like, and what are the most important issues we should be paying attention to?",
    "We are primarily accountable to readers like you because donations from readers like you are our biggest source of income.",
    "Trump ended up tapping former Sen. David Purdue, who lost last year’s other U.S. Senate runoff in Georgia to Jon Ossoff.",
    "And it’s not wrong to say that the Democrats’ majority in the Senate really hinges on these two races,” he emphasized.",
    "“You need to treat this like a presidential election—there’s that much at stake.”\n“Let’s start at a 30,000 foot level.",
    "So it’s going to be a hard year for Democrats despite redistricting turning out much better than most folks expected.",
    "Some are legitimate—some are BS grievances fueled by Republicans, but this is the backdrop we face going into 2022.",
    "But generally speaking, voters tend to take out their frustrations on the party in power, whether justified or not.",
    "Now, Democrats have pushed legislation in Congress for many years calling for an end to partisan gerrymandering.",
    "Well, it turned out that much of that fear was not justified, because Democrats refused to unilaterally disarm.",
    "And as a result, we have a playing field that is definitely looking better than we had every reason to expect.",
    "Republicans, on the other hand, have what Nir called an “absolutely disgusting” primary, where former Gov.",
    "The two leading candidates appear to be Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and Congressman Connor Lamb.",
    "“Let’s go to Georgia first, where we have Rev.—Senator—Raphael Warnock running for reelection.",
    "“For that sin, Trump decided to go and recruit a candidate to run against him,” Nir explained.",
    "Talk about what you’re seeing in Georgia, particularly on the GOP side,” Sudbay said.",
    "You can listen to the full audio here:\nx\nx\nx\nThis is a short blurb about Daily Kos.",
    "So Democrats said in response, ‘Well, we’re not going to just take this lying down.",
    "That's not just journalists, but fact-checkers, editors, and administrative staff.",
    "And whoever emerges from that primary is going to definitely be a little bloodied.",
    "He has an incredibly devoted following in a way that few senators tend to have.",
    "I can’t even imagine what the first-quarter numbers are going to be for him.",
    "“Ohio really has moved pretty far to the right; Trump won it quite solidly.",
    "We don't have corporate backers that are only in it for the bottom line.",
    "Next up, Nir and Sudbay chatted about Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",
    "The Democrats also have a contested primary, but it’s not nasty.",
    "It's important:\n Media outlets shed 28,637 jobs last year alone.",
    "What’s your sense of how this year is shaping up?” Sudbay asked.",
    "And unfortunately, voters have a lot of frustrations right now.",
    "Once again, Republicans have a bitter, vicious, nasty primary.",
    "I just don’t see it changing hands, especially in a midterm.",
    "On the GOP side, things have gotten off to a chaotic start.",
    "“In both cases, it was by really, really narrow margins.",
    "It’s really, for the most part, being run on the issues.",
    "In fact, historically, it usually does quite poorly.",
    "They’ve already spent tens of millions of dollars.",
    "Now he’s in a bitter primary fight against Kemp.",
    "“So this a major election [year],” Sudbay said.",
    "So he’ll have all the resources he needs.",
    "There have been some exceptions to that.",
    "But Republicans have refused to pass it.",
    "We’ll see what happens there.",
    "Click here to donate $3 now.",
    "Donate $3\nDonate $5 monthly",
    "Want to keep it that way?",
    "Daily Kos is different.",
    "Please read it.",
    "Vance."
