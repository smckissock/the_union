    "Advertisement\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressed his assessment of the gathering when he claimed in response to Greene’s attendance: “There’s no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) described Greene’s — and Rep. Paul Gosar’s (R-Ariz.) — participation as “appalling.”\nBut at a GOP candidates’ debate, Vance said Greene “is my friend and she did nothing wrong.”\n“I’m not going to throw her under the bus,” he added.",
    "Vance on Monday supported Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) speaking engagement at a white nationalist conference last month, insisting: “She did nothing wrong.”\nGreene spoke in person at the America First Political Action Conference, whose organizer complained to the audience that the nation had forgotten “young white men.” Participants hailed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a hero and chanted his name.",

    "Me: yeah it's a mystery...\n— Dad Jokes Panda (@TrashPandaFTW) March 29, 2022\nApparently in today’s Republican party there’s “nothing wrong” to speak at a racist white nationalists conference.",
