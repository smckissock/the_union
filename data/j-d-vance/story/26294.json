    "It’s all over the place,” Trump said as Stahl quickly shot back with a defiant “No.”\nThe back and forth continued until Stahl reiterated once more that she disapproved of Trump’s comments and “didn’t know” if what he said was true.",
    "They refused to report on Hilary Clinton spying, Hunter Biden’s laptop, Tara Reade’s sexual assault claims against Joe Biden, Joe Biden’s mental decline, and many other material stories.",
    "The backlash comes after new allegations by special counsel John Durham in the inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation gjzg support the former president’s suspicions.",
    "In the October 2020 interview, Trump declared that “the biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign.”\n“There is no real evidence of that,” Stahl responded.",
    "I say all the time: Trump’s greatest accomplishment is not any particular policy, but revealing the corruption at the heart of our institutions,” said J.D.",

    "“As a matter of fact, I don’t know that.”\n“Lesley Stahl should apologize to Donald Trump,” Trump’s son Eric Trump said Sunday on Twitter.",
    "And you will see that, Lesley, and you know that, but you just don’t want-,” Trump said before Stahl interjected.",
    "That is because the media’s objective is to help the Democrats defeat and destroy their opposition.",
    "Facebook, Google search et al have shadow-banned, suspended and deleted us from your news feeds.",
    "The mainstream media aided the Democrat Party in 2020 to take down President Trump.",
