    "Here’s a video that explains the basics of the policies:\nLast night’s Ohio GOP Senate debate: “Do you think … for the betterment of the Republican Party it’s time for Donald Trump to stop talking about the 2020 election and move on?”\nJust one candidate, Matt Dolan, raised his hand.",
    "And Mandel got the Politico treatment, in which 75 people told the publication he had “been nothing if not an eager reader and rider of political currents.” (I have to mention here that Mandel and Gibbons squared up at another debate in a near fight, by the way.)",
    "While House Republicans have said they want to implement a redux of the 1994 “Contract with America” (they’re getting help from original architect, and bad person, Newt Gingrich), it’s unclear if that’s the policy of the party.",
    "To be clear about a small point here, it’s not even that these Republicans are saying it would run contrary to the “betterment” of the country for Trump to drop his continuing coup chatter.",
    "The current frontrunner is Mike Gibbons, former co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Ohio and a businessman who dabbled in racism against Asians in a podcast in 2013.",
    "And, as the Associated Press noted, the race is the most indicative in the country—with all the candidates gleefully sucking up—of how much the GOP has changed.",
    "It outlines the fundamentals of the GOP’s platform: Four of five members of the party don’t believe in democracy enough to admit that Donald Trump lost in 2020.",
    "Mostly, this has been pegged to discontent with the Democratic Party and the fact that the president’s party typically loses seats in midterm elections.",
    "And Florida Sen. Rick Scott’s plan—while ticking traditional Republican boxes of xenophobia and hatred of the poor—has not been accepted by McConnell.",
    "Vance, backed by the Silicon Valley money of Peter Thiel, had a Washington Post profile wondering how he kind of stopped believing in democracy.",
    "In any case, the gist of both Vance and Mandel is that, at the end of the day, people running for the US Senate will do anything to get power.",
    "honest folks!—and I want to talk about that to win in 2022.” Even this dirge of candidate-speak is just too much for them though.",
    "Mitch McConnell told a reporter that he’d “let [them] know” when he had figured out the Senate Republican agenda.",
    "While both Vance and Mandel trail Gibbons, they are outpolling the one person who raised their hand: Matt Dolan.",
    "Each right-wing radicalization can come down to the simple fact that a lot of Americans like what they’re doing.",
    "But he has gotten less attention on the national level than the two can-you-believe-they-went-kind-of-fascist?",
    "It is that they are afraid to even say the party should “move on” from the last election for political gain.",
    "pic.twitter.com/h4UGOhOMVv\n— Natalie Allison (@natalie_allison) March 22, 2022\nI found that helpful.",
    "But, last night, we got a step closer to figuring out the core of the Republican message in 2022.",
    "Usually, news highlights the loud, even bombastic, defenses of Trump by budding authoritarians.",
    "As happened often in 2020, the race has been haunted by the question: Who will Trump endorse?",
    "All they’d have to say is something like: “Real people care about real issues—kitchen table!",
    "And that has left it unclear what the Republicans’ policy agenda actually constitutes.",
    "It’s particularly interesting because this video is from a GOP Senate debate in Ohio.",
    "It leaves one Republican waving his hand in a room of people staring ahead, silent.",
    "That’s just enough space to pretend the party has good folks there, fighting back.",
    "It’s the silent complicity of adults trying to stand very still.",
    "This groveling has been, it seems, fun for the former president.",
    "The Republican Party is expected to win the 2022 midterms.",
    "Vance and Mandel thought it would help them get elected.",
    "Anti-democracy can be a career move, too, after all.",
    "Timken, Mandel, Gibbons and Vance stared ahead.",
    "No one asked them to say he broke democracy.",
    "No one asked them to concede Trump lost.",
    "But this clip is a more solid explainer.",
    "(It used his beard to explain it?)",
    "The imagery is well placed here.",
    "Vance and Josh Mandel.",
    "So, they went for it.",
    "meat and potatoes!",
    "candidates: J.D."
