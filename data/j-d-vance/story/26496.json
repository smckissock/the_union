    "Mike DeWine, Larry Hogan Win McNamee/Getty Images; Drew Angerer/Getty Images\nPresident Biden, whom both governors saw on Sunday at a dinner hosted by the National Governors Association and again on Monday, is poised to spend much of the midterm campaign year trying to draw sharper contrasts with Republicans.",
    "DeWine said Republicans \"are for opportunity\" and cited his work on expanding early childhood education and economic development –-- including recently announced plans by semiconductor giant Intel to spend $20 billion constructing two microchip plants near Columbus.",
    "Asked which element of the federal government is sparking the confusion – the White House or federal agencies – Hogan said much of it \"does come out of the CDC but some at the FDA, some at different places, but the White House has to get control of it.",
    "In Maryland, Hogan is being wooed for a run against Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, whom national Republicans believe would be vulnerable to a challenge from a governor with approval ratings that top 70% in some surveys.",
    "Hogan, however, is a moderate who has openly criticized former President Trump over his handling of the pandemic, as well as those in his own party whose actions he thinks have been driven by fear of retaliation by Trump.",
    "Those polls also show strong enough support among Black, Latino and women voters, making him an especially appealing general election candidate in a state that hasn't elected a Republican senator in more than 40 years.",
    "Hogan believes his high approval rating in the state, his more pragmatic brand of Republican politics as well as his party's desire to flip control of the Senate this year, are why party leaders keep asking him to run.",
    "And maybe it's not where a lot of people are today in the Republican base, but I can tell you, there's somewhere over 40% of the people, who are not supporting Trump, don't want Trump to run again.",
    "Many of them have made the lockdown measures DeWine took at the onset of the pandemic — which were similar to those taken by Democratic governors — a centerpiece of their campaigns.",
    "DeWine says there's still work to do with the White House on acquiring more tests as his state sees a high number of positive cases and deaths due to the Omnicron variant.",
    "On the COVID-19 pandemic, both governors expressed confidence in the way their states are responding, with Hogan touting some of the nation's highest vaccination rates.",
    "Maryland embraces public health, given in part that it's the home of the National Institutes of Health and other major hospitals and medical research centers.",
    "And the crowded GOP primary field of U.S. Senate contenders take issue with the governor's positive assessment of his handling of the public health crisis.",
    "So I understand people not being happy with everything that's going on that the government has done,\" DeWine said Saturday in an interview with CBS News.",
    "In Ohio, DeWine faces a Republican primary opponent Jim Renacci, who is sharply critical of how he's overseen the Buckeye State's pandemic response.",
    "I've said that every time they've asked for more than a year now, but that hasn't stopped them from continuing to push and ask,\" he told CBS News.",
    "But he criticized the Biden administration's federal response, blaming \"the mixed messaging where we just constantly get conflicting guidance.\"",
    "Speak with a clear voice and, and be responsive to the governors who really have been on the frontlines of this thing for more than two years.\"",
    "He has until the state's February 22 deadline to jump into the Senate race against Van Hollen, but Hogan on Saturday again dismissed the idea.",
    "But it's a big difference going from running a state to being one of 100 people who argue all day and don't seem to get much done,\" he added.",
    "Former president Donald Trump has not endorsed DeWine's challenger yet, as he has in Georgia, but DeWine says he's not too worried about it.",

    "\"People are making pretty cogent arguments about [it], but it's not something I aspire to… I don't want to go argue with people all day.",
    "Maryland's Larry Hogan and Ohio's Mike DeWine are among the most popular governors in the nation among their home state residents.",
    "Vance, DeWine dismissed it all as evidence of personal ambition and candidates stoking frustrations dredged up by the pandemic.",
    "\"All I can see is a lot of frustrating divisiveness and dysfunction in Washington and a lot of finger-pointing on both sides.",
    "Hogan can't run for another term due to term limits, and he has backed Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.",
    "That's a pretty big lane, especially if you have eight or ten people all fighting in that other lane,\" he said.",
    "I think Republicans — some of them continue to be focused on the past and their view of what happened in 2020.",
    "But within the Republican Party, they're facing challenges that reflect the current state of the party.",
    "And Democrats I think are moving too far to the left, way away from where the rest of the country is.",

    "Omicron was very, very contagious– we're still dealing with it in Ohio.",
    "\"But,\" he added later, \"whether or not there's a path, I'm not sure.\"",

    "But people are saying to me, 'We think you can make a difference.'",
    "And I think about 77% of the people are just really frustrated.\"",
    "Some people didn't like the decisions and you have a primary.\"",
    "Hogan said Republicans like him remain focused on the future.",
