    "What they cannot do is hold this position while also admitting that Trump consistently sided with Putin against Ukraine; that Trump’s efforts to weaken our international commitments are largely aligned with Putin and against the interests of the West; and that we’re now witnessing the awful truth about the threat that Trump consistently downplayed.",
    "But she also insists the true version of “America First” entails taking aggressive non-military steps against Putin, because this will “protect American security interests at home and abroad.”\nIt is in our interests, and in the interests of the West and liberal democracy, to defend Ukraine through sanctions and other measures.",
    "Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), a member of the House GOP leadership, issued a statement ripping Putin as an “authoritarian dictator” but spent far more time attacking Biden’s “weakness.”\nOther Republicans have made similar claims, mostly by arguing that Biden should have imposed sanctions earlier.",
    "After claiming not to care about Ukraine’s fate, he abruptly issued a new statement admitting the invasion is a tragedy but blaming “elites” and “globalists” for the problem, insisting those taking action to defend Ukraine secretly want to drag the United States into armed conflict.",
    "How can they express horror and condemnation — which no doubt are sincerely felt — over Vladimir Putin’s actions while avoiding taking a position on Donald Trump’s praise of the Russian leader, let alone on Trump’s long history of kowtowing to him?",
    "But here’s the key point: Blaming Biden’s weakness also obscures Trump’s alignment with Putin on the bigger question of whether Ukrainian sovereignty and the international order should be defended in the face of Putin’s threats to it.",
    "The solutions Republicans have hatched to this problem usefully illuminate the range of acceptable opinion in the party, and the constraints on it, at a moment when many Republicans still see Trump as essential to the party’s future.",
    "Before this, of course, Trump accepted Putin’s denial of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and wielded U.S. military aid as corrupt leverage against Ukraine even as it pleaded for help against Russian aggression.",
    "What’s also notable, however, is how Republicans are finding new sweet spots that allow them to condemn Putin while also vaguely retaining fidelity to the underlying worldview that Trump’s praise of Putin reflects.",
    "Republicans are erasing what Trump got spectacularly wrong and replacing it with an account in which Trump was and remains eternally strong, which is faithful to Trumpism at its most base level.",
    "The story is essentially that Trump’s praise of Putin has left him isolated, now that many Republicans are condemning the invasion, even as Republicans avoid faulting Trump directly for this.",
    "But Vance manages to condemn Putin while remaining faithful to Trumpist nationalist tropes, without admitting how aligned they — and Trump himself — are with Putin’s own worldview and goals.",
    "We can legitimately debate how sanctions should have been imposed, but given all we’ve seen, no one can seriously pretend earlier sanctions would have likely dissuaded the invasion.",
    "You see, internationalist commitments cannot simply be admittedly insufficient in a situation where armed aggression by a nuke-possessing madman leaves no good options.",
    "But Vance deep-sixes nuance: NATO’s successes in maintaining decades of relative peace and security for hundreds of millions of people are entirely erased.",
    "And he bizarrely claims the only “solution” to “tyranny abroad” is a strongly nationalist America — but how this would have stopped Putin is unexplained.",
    "But in the real world, this has nothing in common with Trump’s vision of “America First,” which has long been all about weakening the Atlantic alliance.",
    "These commitments must have no value whatsoever and can reflect only corrupt elite plotting, and the only answer can be maximal withdraw from them.",
    "And as Damon Linker notes, Putin didn’t invade Ukraine before almost surely because Trump was also committed to Putin’s goal of weakening NATO.",
    "Trump has publicly praised Putin’s moves as “smart” and “savvy” and as “genius,” and he has reportedly also lavished private praise on Putin.",
    "But even more notable is that, while they are condemning Putin, they’re also finding ways to cast this as somehow the Trumpist position.",
    "Here again, there’s a legitimate historical debate over whether NATO expanded too far in a way that aggrieved Russia.",
    "Now that this aggression has become a horrifying reality, very few Republicans have condemned Trump for any of this.",
    "Meanwhile, one of Vance’s primary opponents, former Ohio state GOP chair Jane Timken, condemns Putin’s aggression.",
    "One way Republicans are accomplishing this is to condemn Putin’s invasion while blaming Biden for it.",
    "Many Republicans are legitimately horrified by Putin’s invasion and do support action against it.",
    "Magically, the alignment of “America First” Trumpism with Putin’s interests is simply erased.",
    "The Post has a remarkable new overview of quotes from Republicans about the situation.",
    "The invasion of Ukraine has presented Republicans with a vexing conundrum.",
    "Vance, the “Hillbilly Elegy” author and GOP Senate candidate in Ohio.",
    "What that withdrawal is supposed to be an answer to remains unstated.",
    "Some have even suggested this wouldn’t have happened under Trump.",
    "Vance now dismisses the worth of sanctions against Putin.",
    "Here’s the bottom line.",
    "This is absurd.",
    "Take J.D."
