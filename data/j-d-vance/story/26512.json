    "Advertisement\nVance was heavily criticized for a tweet to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey asking him to “let Trump back on” the social media network because “we need Alec Baldwin tweets.”\nConsidering Vance criticized then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016 for making “reprehensible” remarks, Spectrum News’ Taylor Popielarz was curious how the “Hillbilly Elegy” author justified similar hot takes.",
    "I asked Vance how he justifies that type of rhetoric: pic.twitter.com/vWCbthK4oz\n— Taylor Popielarz (@TaylorPopielarz) January 24, 2022\nAs you can see in the clip, Vance defended making offensive jokes because, “unfortunately, our country’s kind of a joke.",

    "Vance came under fire in October after he made a tasteless joke about the tragic prop-gun death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins to attack outspoken Republican critic Alec Baldwin.",
    "“So I think the idea that we can’t have somewhat offensive humor sometimes from our politicians is basically just asking us to have fake politicians all the time.",
    "Now Vance is defending the bombastic rhetoric and tasteless tweets as something Ohio voters should want in a candidate.",
    "Right?”\nVance then attempted to make the case that it’s better for a politician to be offensive than not.",
    "“Every single person that I knew was joking about what would Donald Trump say if he was on Twitter.",
    "Advertisement\n“I think it’s important for our politicians to have a sense of humor.",
    "I think it’s important for us to be real people,” Vance said.",
    "And we should be able to tell jokes about it.",
    "That’s not what I’m going to be.",
    "We need Alec Baldwin tweets.\"",
