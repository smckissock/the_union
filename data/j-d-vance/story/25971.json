    "And one of the things I’m proposing, Tucker, is that, look, we’re going to send $10 billion of aid to the Ukrainians, what Republicans should do, what we should do to look after our own voters is to say that for every dollar that goes to the Ukrainians, we should send $3 to the American southern border.",
