    "He is driven, as he once put it, by \"the charisma of realism.”\nIn the 1980s, when he was the vice-president of the SPD’s youth wing, known as the Jusos, and a member of the group’s left-wing Stamocap wing, which drew on the Marxist-Leninist thesis of state-monopolistic capitalism, Scholz called for the \"end of the capitalist economy.” Later, as the party’s secretary general under SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, he defended the latter’s controversial Agenda 2010, whose wide-ranging reforms included cutbacks in the welfare system and the liberalization of the labor market.",
    "Lars Klingbeil, now a co-leader of the party, confirms as much: \"It is important to Scholz that nobody should ever again turn away from the party because they feel betrayed by it.”\nWhen the SPD again joined Angela Merkel’s CDU as junior coalition partner after losing the 2017 election, it was Nahles and Scholz who ultimately forged the partnership with the conservatives.",
    "On German television, Lindner was asked, \"How high are the chances that you will ultimately get your way on this?” He answered: \"High.” It took days of meetings, in some cases until the early morning hours, before the coalition partners were finally able to agree on a relief package, including a tax rebate for gasoline – one that is set to expire after three months.",
    "It is where he tried out a number of things on a small scale that he would later apply on the larger canvas of the Finance Ministry or, indeed, in his election platform: concepts to fight youth unemployment, to improve digital administration and to boost public infrastructure, such as roads, daycares and universities.",
    "Scholz’s government isn’t yet acting on the international level, and it has required a fair amount of coaxing to get into line with the others, whether it’s the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, arms deliveries to Kyiv or the ejection of Russian banks from the SWIFT banking information system.",
    "For the German chancellor, it wouldn’t take much effort to visit the site where thousands of refugees from Ukraine are arriving each day – where hundreds of volunteers are helping the new arrivals with their basic needs and registration before escorting them to buses waiting to bring them to shelters.",
    "Time to Step Up\nAnd while other countries proudly announce every day the weapons they have delivered to Ukraine, the German public is only slowly discovering that the Germans have supplied more to Kyiv than helmets, bazookas and seriously defective East German anti-aircraft missiles.",

    "Due to pressure from the FDP, the coalition now also wants to largely remove the COVID restrictions, which are to only remain possible in so-called \"hot spots.” The Bundestag is to pass a law on the subject, but the states feel like they have been sidelined.",
    "People speak of \"FBI methods” when describing his cross-examination tactics, and they mention his deceptively drowsy \"late-night radio voice.” Others say he is like a crocodile, listening silently for a long time before pouncing when he senses weakness.",
    "Scholz, a lawyer with a penchant for numbers and statistics, seemed well-suited to the task – or at least better suited than his two main competitors, Armin Laschet of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and Annalena Baerbock of the Greens.",

    "He is a man who walks in short strides, slightly stooped, as he makes his way up the red carpets that are rolled out for him, and who generally speaks quietly into the microphones set up for him.",
    "At that moment, Scholz fulfilled the famous promise he made many years ago: \"If you order leadership from me, that’s what you’ll get.”\nBut in the silence following the big bang, he disappeared.",
    "In September 2021, the Germans opted for a reserved head of government who prefers substance over style, one whose most salient characteristic is tedium and who never, ever raises his voice.",
    "Scholz knows the legends about his negotiation style, and they are likely congruent with his perception of himself as someone excellently prepared, shrewd and, if necessary, tough as nails.",

    "He is a fan of the sociologist Andreas Reckwitz and of the American philosopher Michael Sandel – and even in the middle of the pandemic, he managed to read a book about the Moors in Spain.",
    "There was the fraud scandal surrounding Wirecard, a bit of malfeasance that Germany’s supervisory authority BaFin failed to identify at a time when Scholz was head of the Finance Ministry.",

    "Friedrich Merz, the head of the parliamentary group of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has already stated that his people do not want to be the \"back-up bench” for Scholz.",
    "There have been a few of the latter: The riots on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Hamburg -- in part the result of Scholz, who was mayor at the time, having misjudged the situation.",

    "One minister in the current federal government says: \"Scholz works like a vacuum-cleaner salesman.” He says that Scholz makes people believe that they themselves wanted his solution.",
    "Then, when he became Hamburg’s interior senator, Scholz took a hardline approach and approved the forced use of emetics, substances which induce vomiting, for suspected drug dealers.",
