    "Like other critics of Trump, the senator decried the former president’s “genius” talk, saying, “It is outrageous, if unsurprising, that Trump would praise Putin’s murderous invasion of Ukraine as an act of ‘genius.’ It should concern us all that Putin is exactly the kind of leader Trump would like to be, and that so few Republicans have the courage to say this out loud.”\nSanders emphasized the need for “serious sanctions on Putin and his oligarchs, including denying them access to the billions of dollars that they have stashed in European and American banks.” And the Vermont senator highlighted the bravery of anti-war protesters across Ukraine and Russia, noting how “even as the Ukrainian people are bravely resisting this aggression, anti-war protests have taken place in 40 different Russian cities, and at least 1,000 Russian citizens have been arrested for opposing the war.”\n“Today, I stand in solidarity with those people” added Sanders.",

    "However we keep having leaders that seem to think they can get away with war and they do!” observed Wright on Thursday, as she highlighted the role of anti-war demonstrators who “hit the streets with signs and banners with our concern so leaders and media see visible opposition to war.”\nThe anti-war demonstrators in Moscow and St Petersburg, who hit the streets shouting “No to war!” were undoubtedly seen by Putin.",
    "And he did just that when he responded to Russian aggression toward Ukraine by praising Russian President Vladimir Putin’s tactical “genius.” Displaying his unique brand of international solidarity, Trump joined a right-wing radio show on Tuesday and hailed Putin’s announcement that he would send Russian troops into Ukraine as “peacekeepers.”\nTrump’s not concerned about peace, of course.",
    "Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is among those who have stepped up to hail the anti-war protesters who, despite police crackdowns on protests and arrests of anti-war activists such as Marina Litvinovich, have rejected the notion that Putin’s imperial ambitions are the stuff of “genius.”\nNeedless to say, that’s not what Trump and his compatriots are doing.",
    "Before Americans start complaining about rising gas prices, we should think hard about their courage.”\nThe marchers drew high praise from Bernie Sanders, who was in the forefront of advocating for diplomacy before the invasion, who raised concerns about NATO expansion when few others did, and who continues to champion efforts to de-escalate tensions.",
    "Ann Wright, a retired Army colonel and US diplomat who resigned in protest over the US invasion of Iraq, recounted that as many as 1,600 Russians have been arrested for protesting the Russian invasion of Ukraine, just as Americans were arrested when they protested against the Iraq invasion in March, 2003.",

    "“In an authoritarian country like Russia, protest is an act of enormous courage.”\nThe senator, along with US anti-war leaders and activists who have recognized the Russian protests, is speaking a vital truth that Donald Trump will never understand.",
    "“Finally, only the anti-war movement of Russians, in my opinion, can save life on this planet.”\nMuratov is wise in his assessment of the strikingly large protests that have broken out in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities.",
    "Instead of standing on principle, they are busy apologizing for—and, in some cases, explicitly embracing—the excesses of the oligarchs and strongmen they are so prone to admire.",
    "Contrast their statements with the position taken by Americans who have consistently opposed this country’s wrongheaded wars and who now oppose Russia’s wrongheaded war.",
    "Trump, a former commander in chief, went to the most jaw-dropping extremes, with a cavalier celebration of Putin’s plan to “keep peace” by invading a sovereign country.",
    "Very, very well.”\nTrump’s amen corner in conservative media, and in much of the Republican Party, echoed his line, which went soft on Putin and tough on Biden.",
