    "First, George Voinovich, who had been Cleveland mayor and Ohio governor before serving two Senate terms, then Portman, a veteran congressman who had been President George W. Bush's U.S. Trade Representative and White House budget director.",
    "\"A cavalcade of clowns,\" declared the Ohio Democratic Party, whose officials and Senate primary candidates probably can't believe their luck this year in a state that has been trending red statewide with Trump handily carrying it twice.",
    "It's nearly impossible to imagine the late Voinovich or Portman angrily going nose-to-nose with an opponent in a debate, as current candidates entrepreneur Mike Gibbons and former state treasurer Josh Mandel did recently.",
    "Mandel, Gibbons, Timken and Vance devote much of their time and resources trying to out-Trump each other, and are obviously running scared of displeasing the ex-president by even acknowledging he lost the 2020 election.",
    "While both usually voted party line, they were also known for their willingness to work across the aisle (it was called \"bipartisanship,\" for younger readers unfamiliar with the concept).",
    "Dolan's apparent only wrongdoing is declining to prostrate himself before Trump, preferring to look ahead than dwell in Trump's fantasies about overturning the presidential election.",
    "\"Republican candidates in a Senate primary are competing with World Wrestling Entertainment for most outrageous behavior,\" wrote Gary Abernathy in a March 23 Washington Post column.",
    "Maybe it's time for some brave Ohio Republicans to jump off Trump's back and try running to hold a Senate seat with the professional style that has worked well for 23 years.",
    "Opinion contributor\nSumming up recent developments in Ohio's Republican U.S. Senate race, a veteran campaign strategist commented: \"Tim Ryan is having a great week.\"",
    "Abernathy, a retired newspaper editor/publisher in suburban Loveland, writes \"Trump Country\" columns and is a former Republican Party official and officeholder.",
    "But he also said state Sen. Matt Dolan of Cleveland is the best-qualified Republican candidate to succeed Portman and become \"a good senator.\"",
    "The commenter was Kellyanne Conway, longtime national Republican adviser, and she was talking about the Democratic primary front-runner.",
    "Enquirer political columnist Jason Williams wrote on March 23 that Ohio Republicans need for Trump to intercede and stop the madness.",
    "Dan Sewell, who retired from daily journalism last year after 44 years, is a member of The Enquirer board of contributors.",
    "Williams suggested Timken, the former Ohio GOP chair already backed by Portman, would be the right pick for Trump.",
    "Or appearing in a campaign commercial referencing opponents' sexual equipment, as candidate Jane Timken has.",
    "Rob Portman of Terrace Park, whose announced retirement at the end of his second term has led to the chaos.",
    "The seat at stake has been Republican since 1999, held by two of the state's most successful politicians.",
    "Or being dismissive of Russian-invaded Ukraine, as author and venture capitalist J.D.",
    "There is an old saying: \"He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount.\"",

    "Think about that, Republicans.",
    "Vance was."
