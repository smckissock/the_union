    "Speaking after the debate, he justified his position by arguing, “One of them very directly affects our vital national security interests, one of them kills our people, and the other doesn’t.”\nVanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and director of its initiative on non-state armed actors, said Vance has put his finger on a useful lever, but his plan falls apart after that.",
    "“It allows our military to go to Mexico, to go on our southern border, and actually do battle with them.”\nIt’s notable that Vance, who argues against involvement in Ukraine over concerns that U.S. soldiers could eventually be dragged into that conflict, readily suggests deploying troops in a different nation to pursue American interests.",
    "“Not because this will have any impact on the behavior of the cartels or their activity, but as a pressure on the Mexican government to start cooperating with our counternarcotic efforts.”\nThe Mexican government under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, she explained, has largely stepped back for those drug intervention efforts.",
    "“But at the same time (it) would significantly complicate various dimensions of U.S. foreign policy.”\nThe designation gives government officials financial tools to pursue those providing “material support” to a terrorist organization, but Felbab-Brown contends they’re duplicative of measures already in place against the cartels.",
    "Label cartels terrorist organizations\nVance suggests the U.S. military is the right tool to fight the drug cartels producing and smuggling drugs into the U.S.\n“We need to declare the Mexican drug cartels a terrorist organization because that’s exactly what they are,” he argued on the debate stage.",

    "“If you stop that spigot, you actually make it a lot more easy to control the southern border.”\nPressed on his claims that undocumented immigrants are receiving benefits after a recent debate Vance argued there are too many “loopholes” in current policy.",
    "— GOP (@GOP) February 20, 2022\nMore immigrants are showing up at the border, but Customs and Border Protection also notes their figures “somewhat overstate the number of unique individuals” because recidivism has jumped as well.",
    "“Immigrants for the most part come to the United States to work, to be reunited with family, to build a better life for themselves and their families.”\nThe Forum is pro-immigration, but it’s not a left leaning organization.",
