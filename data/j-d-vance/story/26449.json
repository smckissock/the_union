    "During an interview with Spectrum News’ Taylor Popielarz, Vance, author of the book “Hillbilly Elegy,” was asked about a tweet he sent about the shooting incident on the set of the film “Rust.”\n“You had said, ‘Dear Jack, let Trump back on, we need Alec Baldwin tweets’ — as this, you know, deadly shooting was playing out,” Popielarz said.",
    "I asked Vance how he justifies that type of rhetoric: pic.twitter.com/vWCbthK4oz\n— Taylor Popielarz (@TaylorPopielarz) January 24, 2022\nHe continued, “I think it’s important for our politicians to have a sense of humor.",
    "Watch the video below:\nWhen Alec Baldwin fired a gun on a movie set last fall that led to the death of a cinematographer, #OHSen candidate @JDVance1 tagged Twitter’s CEO in a tweet and asked him to “let Trump back on.",
    "So I think the idea that we can’t have somewhat offensive humor sometimes from our politicians is basically just asking us to have fake politicians all the time.”\n“That’s not what I’m going to be.",
    "How do you explain that?”\n“I’d say like, look, people may not always agree with my rhetoric, but I think, unfortunately, our country’s kind of a joke.",
    "He asked, “If a voter sees that as they’re plugging into this race, and they say, is that the type of rhetoric I want a US senator to have?",
    "Vance claimed that the U.S. is “kind of a joke” in response to a question about his rhetoric and whether it would be a turn-off to voters.",
    "Every single person that I knew was joking about what would Donald Trump say if he was on Twitter.",
    "Maybe it turns some people off, but I think the realness turns more people on,” he added.",
    "We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",
    "I think it’s important for us to be real people.",
    "And we should be able to tell jokes about it.",
    "Ohio Republican Senate hopeful J.D.",
    "We need Alec Baldwin tweets.\"",
    "Read our editorial standards.",
    "Right?” Vance responded.",
    "Right?"
