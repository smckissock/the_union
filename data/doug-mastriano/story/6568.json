    "We were a people without vision or direction.?\nUltimately, Mastriano concluded that the U.S. military was the only institution to prevent the destruction of the republic.?\nThe document displays a disgust for anyone who doesnt hold his view that homosexuality is a form of aberrant sexual conduct? and presages the worldview that has led Mastriano to blame rampant fraud for Donald Trumps 2020 defeat and to join a crowd headed toward the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThis thesis proves that Mastrianos embrace of activity that undermines the U.S. Constitution is no recent corruption,? said Peter Feaver, a former senior White House official in the George W. Bush administration who was written extensively about civil-military relations.",
    "Dunlaps award-winning essay highlighted the militarys worrisome drift into civilian affairs and the tendency of the country to view the armed forces as Americas most  and perhaps only  trusted arm of government.?

    "Im not going to stand aside and let them create a narrative about me.?\nAs a state senator and candidate for governor, Mastriano, 58, has vowed to decertify voting machines in counties where he suspects the results are rigged and has asserted Pennsylvanias majority-Republican legislature should have the right to choose which presidential electors to send to Washington.",
    "Mastrianos 2001 thesis is especially striking in its doubts that an apolitical U.S. military should fall under the control of elected, civilian leaders, a bedrock principle of American democracy that is drilled into U.S. military officers from the moment they take an oath to support and defend? the U.S. Constitution.",
    "The thesis, written in 2001 when Mastriano was a major at the Air Forces Air Command and Staff College, is highly unusual for its doomsaying and often fearful point of view, and its prediction that only the U.S. military could save the country from the depredations of the countrys morally debauched civilian leaders.",
    "Two decades before he was Republican nominee for Pennsylvania governor, Doug Mastriano warned in a masters thesis that the United States was vulnerable to a left-wing Hitlerian Putsch? that would begin with the dismantling of the U.S. military and end with the destruction of the countrys democracy.",
    "The militarys collapse, in his telling, allowed a left-wing leader obsessed with political correctness? and backed militarily by the United Nations and the European Union to rise to power in a struggle that led to the deaths of millions of Americans.",
    "His paper was written in response to a 1992 essay by then-Lt. Col. Charles J. Dunlap Jr., who took the point of view of a retired military officer 20 years in the future who had been jailed for joining the resistance to a successful military coup.",
    "He describes a future in which the militarys macho-warrior spirit? and conservative culture? are replaced by a neo-pagan worldview.?\nMastrianos essay also foreshadows his embrace of baseless claims of rigged elections.",
    "In a recent interview with Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to Trump who hosts a podcast, Mastriano claimed that his 30 years of military service and security clearances proved that he did not hold extreme views.",
    "It would erode everything that it purports to respect,? said Tami Davis Biddle, a civilian professor at the U.S. Army War College who retired in 2021 as the Elihu Root Chair of Military Studies.",
    "Mastriano traveled to D.C. on Jan. 6 and videos show him walking with a crowd toward the Capitol as one man removes a bike rack blocking the sidewalk; Mastriano has denied entering the Capitol.",
    "In it, Mastriano adopts the point of view of a colonel who is living in 2018  some 17 years in the future  and has taken refuge in an isolated cavern? in the George Washington National Forest.",
    "Domestically, life was bleak with a rampant drug culture, hedonism and a plethora of alternate religions dominating the American youth,? wrote Mastriano in the voice of his fictional colonel.",
    "It stems from poisonous views and misunderstandings that he has held for a very long time.?\nMastriano did not respond to a voice mail or an email sent to a campaign account for the media.",
    "His ardent support for the former presidents false claims that the election was stolen earned him Trumps last-minute endorsement in Pennsylvanias GOP primary, which he won on Tuesday.",
    "If there was a hint of radicalism in me or far rightness in me, Id never have had that kind of access to the nations most sensitive and destructive secrets,? he told Bannon.",
    "In the paper, he posited that Democrats rage over military absentee ballots that tipped Florida to Bush in the 2000 election would lead them to restrict military voting.",
    "The paper is posted on an official Defense Department website and lists Mastriano as the author at a time when he said he received a masters degree from the school.",
    "Mastrianos essay, by contrast, is a broadside aimed at civilians whom he deems unfit to lead a morally superior U.S. military officer corps.",
    "Its Putinist before Putin.? Mastriano also taught officers at the war college from 2012-2017.",
