    "In April, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Mastriano attended a far-right Christian conference in Gettysburg at which a video was shown explaining \"the great awakening,\" \"ritual child sacrifice\" and, of course, \"the global Satanic blood cult.\"",
    "He organized buses to the Jan. 6 insurrection, got himself subpoenaed by the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol, and tried to get Pennsylvania to do an Arizona Cyber Ninja-style audit or the 2020 vote, which failed laughably.",

    "Who else could start a riot to overthrow a national election in 2021 and fully expect not only to avoid residence in a federal lockup for the rest of his days, but spend some of them in the White House?",
    "Poor Donald Trump, always railing against the people who are out to get him, never acknowledging his great good fortune in that the people who are out to get him are doing a terrible job of it.",
    "Republicans are more interested in getting moles to the polls by enacting laws that allow criminal prosecution and prison time for even marginal mistakes by poll workers and election officials.",
    "Speaking in Buffalo in the aftermath of one of our daily massacres, President Joe Biden noted that \"the American experiment, the democracy, is in danger like it hasn't been in my lifetime.\"",
    "Mastriano raised funds for his campaign off this event, The Inquirer said, as organizers sold an artist's rendering of the 45th president to boost the candidate's bottom line.",
    "Already, it's estimated that up to 20% of election officials in place today will be gone by 2024, as 1 in 6 have already been subject to threats since the last election.",
    "That would certainly be the preference of one Doug Mastriano, whom you doubtless found on Tuesday's Republican primary ballot in the race for Pennsylvania governor.",
    "None tried to suppress my vote, but then, I'm an old white guy, not the intended target of some 250 bills in 27 states designed to root out so-called voter fraud.",
    "Texas banned, among other things, early voting hours on the Sunday before elections, a bull's-eye on Black churches that organize souls-to-the-polls events.",
