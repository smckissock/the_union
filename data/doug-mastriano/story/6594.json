    "The good news for Republicans is that so far during this primary season, there havent been significant cases reported of losers inventing fantasies of fraud and challenging the results and the administrators who reported them  with the unsurprising exception of former president Donald Trump, who spent Wednesday trying to stir up controversy in the still-undecided Pennsylvania Senate race with a new set of wild accusations.",
    "That Pennsylvania candidate, state Senator Doug Mastriano, is widely seen as a terrible general election candidate  so much so that the Cook Report and other neutral rating groups shifted the race from toss-up to leans Democratic after the primary results were in.",
    "But given the very high levels of partisan polarization among voters, candidates usually dont matter much to general election outcomes  with the big potential exceptions of the ones whose flaws are so strong that they may be able to harm their partys prospects.",
    "There are a fair number of interesting primary matchups  but also plenty, as in the Pennsylvania gubernatorial primary or the Texas version back in March, where the party had already converged on a winner well before the voters became directly involved.",
    "In some cases, thats about whether traditional conservatives will be willing to support radicals; its still not clear to what extent mainstream Pennsylvania Republicans will be willing to join Team Mastriano after their efforts to derail him fell flat.",
    "Even incremental change can be important, so its worth keeping an eye on, for example, the US House runoff in Texas later this month pitting one of the least liberal House Democrats, Henry Cuellar, against the very liberal challenger Jessica Cisneros.",
    "That continues to be the sweet spot in all but a handful of constituencies  most Democrats arent looking to nominate more progressive firebrands and Bernie Sanders fans, but also arent looking to shift the party toward its least liberal politicians.",
    "ORourke is unlikely to be a particularly strong candidate for a party that would be unlikely to win even in a good Democratic year given his very liberal policy positions, while Shapiro seems to be a solid choice in a far more competitive state.",
    "Its a huge story that Pennsylvania Republicans have chosen a candidate for governor who appears ready, if he is elected, to certify the Republican presidential candidate as the winner of the states electoral votes regardless of what voters say.",
    "But the truth is that for every one of the handful of contests where Democrats might lose a seat that way, theres a competitive district such as the one in North Carolina where Republicans chose a radical with all sorts of personal baggage.",
    "Pundits tried to find some factional drama in the Democratic Pennsylvania Senate primary, trying to cast Lieutenant Governor John Fettermans big win over the moderate liberal US Representative Conor Lamb as a big ideological battle.",
    "Besides, to the extent that there was any ideological story here, it was probably more similar to the one in the 2020 presidential nomination in which Joe Biden placed himself in the middle of the quite liberal party.",
    "The same would have been the case had Pennsylvania Republicans chosen Kathy Barnette, a participant in the Washington protest marches that culminated in the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021, as their Senate candidate.",
    "There just arent a lot of primary elections this year on the Democratic side, especially in contests for governor and US Senate, that appear likely to have any similar effect on the general election.",
    "To contact the author of this story:\nJonathan Bernstein at jbernstein62@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJonathan Landman at jlandman4@bloomberg.net",
    "Thats also one where its at least plausible that Democrats might cost themselves a House seat if they nominate Cisneros, a candidate who might be out of the districts mainstream.",
    "Rightly so; after all, not only are there important internal fights playing out in GOP nomination battles, but the outcome could determine the fate of US democracy.",
    "And thats one of the reasons why Republican primaries are going to get a lot more coverage than Democratic contests during this election cycle.",
    "There are some policy or ideological splits, and as always different factions are jockeying for additional influence within the party.",
    "He taught political science at the University of Texas at San Antonio and DePauw University and wrote A Plain Blog About Politics.",
    "The other issue thats mainly happening on the Republican side is the possibility that the party wont unite behind some nominees.",
    "This years Republican primary contests are likely to affect general election outcomes and even the fate of US democracy.",
    "This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.",
    "Theres simply a lot less drama on the Democratic side, especially in the most high-profile elections.",
    "In Texas, former US Representative Beto ORourke was the only candidate running a serious campaign.",
    "Its also the case that Republican primaries appear to be more likely to affect November outcomes.",
    "In other cases, the question will be whether radicals who lose will endorse those who beat them.",
    "In Pennsylvania, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro was the only candidate on the ballot.",
    "Thats not to say that Democrats are selecting perfect candidates; no party does that.",
    "@jbview\nMost of the focus during midterm primary season has been on the Republicans.",
    "Jonathan Bernstein is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering politics and policy.",
    "But Fetterman had a big advantage as a statewide elected official.",
    "But theres not much more to say about them.",
    "Thats why theyre getting all the attention."
