    "Mastriano, a state senator and retired U.S. Army colonel who won the GOP nomination for governor last month, was seen outside the Capitol on the day of the insurrection, and he was in regular communication with Donald Trump as the then-president sought to reverse his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
    "The committee has yet to schedule an interview with Mastriano, and he has nothing to hide, Parlatore said\nThe submission of documents from Mastriano comes as lawmakers are looking to gather as much testimony and evidence as they can before beginning a series of public hearings next week.",
    "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)  Pennsylvanias Republican nominee for governor, Doug Mastriano, has offered to sit for an interview with the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and was interviewed by FBI agents last year about it, his lawyer said Thursday.",
    "In its subpoena, the Jan. 6 committee also noted Mastrianos presence outside the Capitol the day of the insurrection, saying his public statements indicated you witnessed agitators  getting in the face of the police and agitators  start pushing the police up the Capitol steps.",
    "Those certificates from the alternate electors were then sent to Congress, where several of Trumps Republican allies in the House and the Senate used them to justify delaying or blocking the certification of the election during the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress.",
    "The committee has interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and collected tens of thousands of pages of documents as it looks to give the American public the most comprehensive look at the events that led to the worst attack on the Capitol in two centuries.",

    "READ MORE: Jurors reject array of defenses at Capitol riot trials\nMastriano previously denied breaking any laws that day, and he has not been charged with any crime in connection to the Capitol attack.",
    "Those individuals went on to declare themselves the rightful electors and submitted false Electoral College certificates declaring Trump the winner of the presidential election in the state.",
    "Congressional investigators are hoping to learn more about Mastrianos role in a plan to arrange for an alternate slate of electors from Pennsylvania for Trump after the 2020 election.",
    "Mastrianos lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said Mastriano told the FBI that he did not know about a planned insurrection or any coordination behind the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
    "He floated a plan in the Republican-controlled state Legislature to undo Bidens victory in Pennsylvania and empower lawmakers to instead award the states electoral votes to Trump.",
    "Mastriano was among Trumps most dedicated supporters during the 2020 campaign and has been a prominent peddler of unsubstantiated claims that the election was stolen from Trump.",
    "Parlatore on Thursday dismissed the committees work as not a real investigation and politically motivated, designed to boost Democrats prospects in Novembers midterm elections.",
    "Mastriano later organized bus trips to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and advertised himself ahead of time as a scheduled speaker on the Capitol steps during the afternoon.",
    "He previously was approached and sat for a voluntary interview with the FBI and told them the truth about everything that happened that day, Parlatore said.",
    "The committee will dedicate a portion of its public hearings to the fake electors scheme and the individuals who helped it come to life.",
