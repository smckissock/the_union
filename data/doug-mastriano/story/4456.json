    "As Murphy put it, the challenge is to make it harder both for a governor to send a false certification to Congress, and for Congress to overturn a state certification.?\nOne approach would build in that judicial backstop against state certification of sham electors while also raising the threshold for Congress to overturn legitimate electors.",
    "The difficulty lies in securing that reform while also preventing a corrupt Congress  a GOP-controlled House and Senate with more Ted Budds in it, for example  from refusing to count legitimate electors to prevent a rightful winner from claiming an electoral college majority.",
    "As in other states, the Pennsylvania legislature exercised its constitutional role in determining the manner? of appointment of electors by passing a law empowering the voters to pick the electors of the candidate they prefer, which the state then certifies.",
    "Of course, if Mastriano becomes governor, the GOP-controlled legislature could pass a new law giving itself and/or the governor the sole authority to determine certification, as constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe points out.",
    "And they can go further: They can focus the public discussion more sharply on the precise nature of the threat, as newly illustrated by the success of Mastriano and other candidates like him.",
    "In a world where such GOP angst might be channeled in a constructive direction, it could result in reforms that render the antidemocratic implications of Mastrianos victory less alarming.",
    "They fear that his active collaboration in Donald Trumps coup attempt, along with his crackpot views, might squander a big gubernatorial pickup opportunity in this crucial swing state.",
    "For now, these GOP primaries are highlighting the need for a much more forceful effort to communicate with the public the precise nature of the threat the elections are highlighting.",
    "Lets start with the threat posed by Mastriano, who has endorsed the principle that the popular vote isnt binding when it comes to state certification of presidential electors.",
    "Hopefully the Pennsylvania results crystallize the coming threat,? Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of a bipartisan group of senators examining fixes to the ECA, told me.",
    "But even if that didnt happen, Mastriano  who appears to believe Gods word permits him to nullify elections  might happily break the law to certify the losers electors.",
    "If a governor certified sham electors  or if a state-level dispute erupted over which electors to certify, say between Kemp and Hice  court challenges would follow.",
    "As governor, Mastriano could handpick a secretary of state who might refuse to certify a Democratic presidential candidates legitimate popular-vote win in 2024.",
    "Trumps grip on these primaries raises an unsettling question: At this point, is our system even capable of protecting itself from the gathering threat?",
    "Republicans are in full-scale panic about Doug Mastriano, the right-wing extremist who won the GOP primary for Pennsylvania governor this week.",
    "Budd voted to object to Joe Bidens electors after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection attempt and has refused to say Biden legitimately won.",
    "Brian Kemp will probably survive his primary  a good development  Hice is running on an implicit vow to subvert future elections.",
    "Meanwhile, Georgia GOP primary voters might nominate the Trump-endorsed Rep. Jody Hice for secretary of state next Tuesday.",
    "All this strengthens the case for ECA reform in a new way, highlighting with fresh specificity which protections we need.",
    "All Trump needs to throw out American democracy is one governor and a majority in the House,? Murphy told me.",
    "One crucial fix would require Congress to count only the electors the courts determine to be legitimate.",
    "On the other side, a few Democrats might defect if the package doesnt include voting rights protections.",
    "Mastriano could then certify sham electors for the Republican candidate in defiance of the popular vote.",
    "If he did this, and a GOP-controlled House of Representatives counted them, they would probably stand.",
    "If its the latter, Democrats will have to seize this moment to press the case for reform much harder.",
    "Everybody that cares about upholding democracy has got to start ringing alarm bells,? Murphy told me.",
    "After all, Republican strategists appear to recognize just how radical Mastriano truly is.",
    "So will their counterparts in Congress act to protect the system from the threat he poses?",
    "In addition to Mastriano, Rep. Ted Budd won the GOP primary for Senate in North Carolina.",
    "Or are they worried only about the threat his extremism poses to GOP electability?",
    "Hes arguably very close to that arrangement.?\nThats where ECA reform comes in.",
    "Such a reform is being considered by the bipartisan group, Murphy told me.",
    "Chief among these is fixing the Electoral Count Act of 1887, or ECA.",
    "Will 10 Republican senators vote for such reforms?",
    "Congress would have to count the rightful winner.",
    "This weeks primaries offer a new hook for this.",
    "This idea has been urged by outside experts.",
    "Murphy says this is being examined.",
    "So what should this look like?",
    "While anti-Trump Georgia Gov.",
    "He can create great mischief.",
    "Both have Trumps support.",
    "This might be unlawful.",
    "We still dont know."
