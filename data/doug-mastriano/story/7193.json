    "Because, one, anyone Mastriano likes is immediately suspicious, and two, the only true world-class people on the planet are Dolly Parton, and 'end of list.'\"",
    "\"I could decertify every machine in the state with the stroke of a pen via my Secretary of State,\" Mastriano said on The Bombeck Show on March 20, 2022.",

    "Oliver went on to highlight some of Mastriano's greatest hits from an album on why he should never be elected to public office ever again.",
    "While Mastriano's people have tried to back him away from QAnon conspiracies, he showed up to their event and accepted a sword from them.",
    "I don't know what's more troubling there, that you think that makes you sound good, or that some people might actually agree with you.\"",
