    "Trump went on to note that Mastriano \"has revealed the Deceit, Corruption, and outright Theft of the 2020 Presidential Election, and will do something about it,\" though he also pointed out other issues, such as how Mastriano \"will also Fight Violent Crime, Strengthen our Borders, Protect Life, Defend our under-siege Second Amendment, and Help our Military and our Vet.\"",
    "What must be conveyed clearly and unflinchingly is this: If Mastriano wins the general election, there is almost certainly no chance that a Democratic presidential candidates victory in Pennsylvania in 2024 will be certified by the states governor.?https://t.co/7rcCs2vxeB\n The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln) May 14, 2022\nThe primary is this upcoming Tuesday, May 17.",
    "President Donald J. Trump announces his Endorsement of Doug Mastriano for Governor of Pennsylvania pic.twitter.com/HrGKVKb7BY\n Liz Harrington (@realLizUSA) May 14, 2022\nAs I highlighted last July, Mastriano had initiated a forensic audit of the 2020 presidential election, which he outlined in an op-ed posted to his official Senate website.",
    "https://t.co/tLFrhuzIjQ\n Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) May 14, 2022\nThe Lincoln Project also weighed in, to hysterically claim that \"there is almost certainly no chance that a Democratic presidential candidate's victory in Pennsylvania in 2024 will be certified.\"",
    "The endorsement also reminded readers that Trump endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Senate primary, to replace Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), who is retiring, and referred to the upcoming midterms as \"the most important Midterm Election in the history of our Country.\"",
    " Joe Szymanski (@JosephSzymanski) May 13, 2022\nTrump's endorsement of Mastriano revealing of his broader strategy right now: deeply invested in dominating GOP but less interested in winning races for Republicans.",
    "\"He is a fighter like few others, and has been with me right from the beginning, and now I have an obligation to be with him,\" Trump also wrote, highlighting another key part about the endorsement.",
    "https://t.co/oh5EVgMhbu\n Fred Bauer (@fredbauerblog) May 14, 2022\nIf Doug Mastriano is the nominee:\nJosh Shapiro is elected Governor of PA. Democrats flip the State House and Senate.",

    "\"There is no one in Pennsylvania who has done more, or fought harder, for Election Integrity than State Senator Doug Mastriano,\" the endorsement began.",
    "\"Mastriano\" is now trending on Twitter as a result, with people sharing their thoughts before and since the endorsement became official.",
    "Earlier on Saturday morning, former President Donald Trump made his endorsement in Pennsylvania's gubernatorial race.",
    "Honest to goodness this is about a 40-50% chance that a Mastriano Gov ticket costs the PA GOP the state house.",
    "Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's current attorney general, is running for governor as a Democrat.",
    "Choosing from eight candidates, Trump went with State Sen. Doug Mastriano.",
    "They threw this election to the Democrats, congrats Josh Shapiro.",
    "Indeed, Trump's endorsement highlighted the 2020 election.",
    "Mastriano is a clown, it's going to be a blood bath.",
