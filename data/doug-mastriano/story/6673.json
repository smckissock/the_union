    "The Republicans fighting for the nomination to hold onto the seat include Dr. Mehmet Oz, a celebrity doctor endorsed by former President Donald Trump, former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick, former Ambassador Carla Sands, and 2020 congressional candidate Kathy Barnette, who's seen a late-breaking surge in the race.",
    "The Pennsylvania primary is also proving to be another battle in an ongoing feud between Trump and the Club after the two backed different candidates in Ohio and clashed over the Club's ads highlighting previous anti-Trump comments made by Trump's endorsed candidate JD Vance.",

    "McCormick and Oz, two wealthy candidates who've lent their own campaigns $11 million and $12 million, respectively, have spent much of the campaign attacking each other on the airwaves and largely ignoring their lesser-known rivals.",
    "Barnette's appeal among Republicans skeptical of Oz and McCormick  the two big spenders in the race  comes amid a particularly unusual backlash to Trump's endorsement of Oz, as Insider recently reported from Pennsylvania.",
    "Barnette, who has raised just $1.7 million through the end of April, saw her support rise from voters and donors alike, including with a last-minute influx of ad spending from the conservative, anti-tax Club for Growth.",
