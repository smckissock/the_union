    "And:\nAnd while Mastriano spent less than $370,000 on TV ads, the Shapiro campaign pumped more than $840,000 to air a spot that attacked Mastriano as too conservative for voters, an ad which actually boosted him on the right, our Zach Montellaro reported.",
    "Viewing him as the easiest Republican to defeat in the general, Shapiro and the state Democratic Party sent out mailers boosting him, our Holly Otterbein noted, helping him rise above other GOP candidates, including former Rep. LOU BARLETTA (R-Pa.).",
    "But, quite obviously, the Democratic Party in Pennsylvania does not really think that the state of democracy? is fragile,? because, if it did think that, it wouldnt have played Machiavellian games in a wave year.",
    "This being so, I do not want to hear a single thing from the Democratic Party about the threat? that Doug Mastriano presents to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or to the republic in general.",
    "Since Joe Biden won in 2020, the party has treated us to endless lectures about our democracy,? while pursuing a wholly unsolicited partisan strategy that has led it into the electoral mire.",
    "When one truly believes that a given candidate is a threat, one doesnt send out mailers boosting him,? or spend $840,000 on television advertisements designed to improve his standing.",
    "One of the most fascinating things we read last night was our colleagues back and forth on the POLITICO live blog about how Mastrianos rise can be partly attributed to Democrats.",
    "In 2016, it was imperative to stop Donald Trump from winning the election  but not imperative enough for the Democrats to moderate in order to win on-the-fence voters.",
    "Given soaring inflation, ongoing supply-chain issues, painfully high gas prices and a spike in violent crime, the general environment is still rich for the GOP.",
    "Case in point: The ad called him one of Donald Trumps strongest supporters?  which, to many GOP primary voters, is a feature, not a bug.",
    "Top Stories\nFor a party that claims to care about the fragile state of democracy,? Politico notes, this is a risky strategy.? Indeed.",
    "Had those primary voters wanted to, they could (and should) have just said, No.? But they didnt, and now Mastriano is the nominee.",
    "And, as Politico notes, he could plausibly win:\nBut this election is far from a sure thing for Democrats.",
    "It took Republican primary voters  not scheming Democrats  to choose Mastriano once he was on the ballot.",
    "If it turns out badly, as it may, I dont want to hear a peep out of those who orchestrated it.",
    "Politico reports that, in Pennsylvania:\nDemocrats helped engineer Mastrianos win.",
    "Astonishingly, it is doing the same thing in Pennsylvania in 2022.",
    "Because the Democratic Party clearly doesnt believe a word of it.",
    "I am, from this moment on, not remotely interested in that case.",
    "Throw in Bidens poor poll numbers, and anything can happen.",
    "This isnt new.",
    "Why not?",
    "How?"
