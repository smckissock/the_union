    "In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriots Breitbart News Saturday, Barletta called on Republicans Dave White and Bill McSwain to drop out of the GOP gubernatorial primary and endorse his candidacy so the party can unite around one candidate against Mastriano, whom former President Trump endorsed on Saturday.",
    "I really hope that Dave White and Bill McSwain would see that as well that Im the one person, Ive been at the top of every poll with Doug Mastriano since the day I announced.?\nAnd they have spent over $20-something million on their campaigns and havent gotten above me once,? he continued.",
    "It wasnt for me, it wasnt for Donald Trump  I did this for the people of Pennsylvania.?\nWere going to have to make a decision in a couple of days whether or not we can pick somebody who cant win,? Barletta said.",

    "While swing voters, by a three percent margin, say they prefer a Republican to a Democrat for governor, 49 percent said they would vote for Shapiro if Mastriano is the GOP nominee.",
    "LISTEN:\nEveryone here in Pennsylvania knows that, that Im the one here that can beat Josh Shapiro and thats the goal, its not to win this primary,? Barletta said.",
    "As Breitbart News reported, Democrat gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro has signaled that he prefers to run against Mastriano in Novembers general election.",
    "So were down to the final days and we need to put our own personal ambitions aside and do whats right for the people of Pennsylvania.",
    "An Osage Research poll of 600 swing voters in Pennsylvania shows Mastriano is losing in a head-to-head matchup with Shapiro.",
