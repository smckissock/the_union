    "His comments are a gross offense to the states Republican Party and its voters, 70 percent of whom did not vote for Oz in the primary (he has 31.2 percent of the vote now) and all of whom should expect a free and fair election.",

    "Any declaration of victory ought to come once the race is called by media, or when other candidates call to concede.",
    "Trumps appeal that Oz do so this time around, before the general election, would be even worse for the state party.",
    "It has allowed insurgents like Doug Mastriano, now the nominee for governor, to gain the foothold they have.",
    "If Oz were to jump the gun now at Trumps behest, any pretext of fairness would be drowned out by the ruckus.",
    "Oz knows hes the front-runner by the skin of his teeth and may slip from first place at any time.",
    "Top Stories\nAs of this writing, Oz holds the lead by 1,420 votes or 0.1 percent.",
    "McCormick and Barnette would rally supporters to push back against the results.",
