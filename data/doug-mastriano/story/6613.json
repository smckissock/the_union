    "Host Tyrus noted on the GOP side, races went at least \"three-deep\" in terms of candidates' tallies  illustrating a more engaged electorate, he suggested:\n\"The numbers of Republicans coming out to vote  I don't care if you're Superman running as a Democrat, you should really be afraid because, yes, your campaign's getting started early, but third-place was running strong.\"",
    "\"He just destroyed Conor Lamb [who was] considered  the perfect candidate; straight out of central-casting for a moderate Democrat in a state like Pennsylvania where he could appeal to the working-class and also rub elbows with the Tech guys\"\nPerino added that Fetterman is, however, a more progressive candidate, dubbing him \"an original BernieBro.\"",
    "Similarly, on the gubernatorial side, Wednesday's tallies illustrated a solid top-four block consisting of Mastriano, Barletta, ex-U.S. Attorney William McSwain and Delaware County Commissioner Dave White  in what was a 9-person field.",
    "The panel on \"The Five\" discussed how many of the races reflected this trend, while the hosts also cautioned both parties shouldn't become complacent against the opposing candidates despite such departure from the proverbial middle.",

    "But, the onetime Braddock mayor \"oozes charisma and authenticity,\" she said, calling that a warning to the ultimate Republican nominee \"not to sleep on\" the race.",
    "Similarly on the GOP gubernatorial side, State Sen. Doug Mastriano of Chambersburg defeated his closest opponent ex-Rep. Lou Barletta of Hazleton.",
    "John Fetterman, the Bernie Sanders-endorsed Democrat who won that party's Senate primary, defeated Rep. Conor Lamb of Mt.",
    "The Democrat in that race, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, ran unopposed, as Gov.",
    "\"John Fetterman; the cat ran away off the spoon in that one,\" Dana Perino said.",
    "Lebanon, whom host Dana Perino described as a traditional Rust Belt candidate.",
    "Both men were viewed as pro-Trump candidates.",
