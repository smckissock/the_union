    "Some fear that that Mastriano on the ticket could also cost Pennsylvania Republicans the state legislatures, as I also highlighted in my weekend coverage of Trump's endorsement.",
    "As I highlighted last July, Mastriano had initiated a forensic audit of the 2020 presidential election, which he outlined in an op-ed posted to his official Senate website.",
    "This comes even after outlets had highlighted divisions in the party over Mastriano, who has also been dubbed \"far-right\" and an \"election denier\" by The New York Times.",
    "Michelle Boorstein claimed for The Washington Post that \"Christian nationalism is shaping a Pa. primary  and a GOP shift,\" when writing about Mastriano on Monday.",

    "Mastriano will face Josh Shaprio, Pennsylvania's current attorney general, in the November general election.",
    "Tom Wolf, the current governor, is term-limited.",
    "Shapiro ran unopposed.",
