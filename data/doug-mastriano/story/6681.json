    "The Emmy Awardwinning host of the Dr. Oz Show entered the contest with the advantage of being a household name and a multimillionaire, but he came under fire for his somewhat tenuous ties to Pennsylvania, his connection to Turkey and its authoritarian leader, and his lack of experience in politics.",
    "The Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary race is too close to call as of Tuesday night just after midnight, with Trump-endorsed celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz running a razor-thin winning margin of less than a thousand votes over hedge-fund executive Dave McCormick.",
    "Former president Donald Trump, who endorsed and campaigned for Oz despite the television stars questionable commitment to conservative principles, released a statement last week saying that Barnette had no chance of beating the Democratic candidate.",
    "Oz and McCormick then switched gears on the campaign trail from criticizing each other to grilling Barnettes history, specifically her appearance at the rally that preceded the January 6 Capitol riot and her inflammatory rhetoric.",
    "While frontrunners Oz and McCormick were neck-and-neck in the polls for much of last month, they recently faced new unexpected competition from conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, who surged ahead at the last-minute.",
    "Barnette, who got into some trouble for past anti-Muslim and anti-gay comments, had joined Trump-backed Republican Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano on the campaign trail this past week.",
    "During his stint on Oprah Winfreys show, Oz gave medical advice to guests that sometimes fell outside his specialty as a cardiothoracic doctor, for which hes also faced some scrutiny.",
    "At stake is the seat held by retiring Republican Pat Toomey, which Democrats are looking to flip to re-capture a majority in the evenly divided Senate.",
    "In the final stretch of vote tabulation, McCormick had garnered a small edge over Oz until that flipped, with more than 90 percent of votes counted.",
    "While Oz earned Trumps support, he has been cautious about embracing the former presidents theories about the 2020 election.",
    "Mastriano won the nomination Tuesday night."
