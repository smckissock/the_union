    "Unfortunately, the U.S. is not a sane country, and instead of actually doing something to prevent these atrocities from occurring all the timein case you missed it, there have been 17 mass shootings since Uvalde, TexasRepublicans have launched a competition in which they duke it out to see who can come up with the most ridiculous thing to blame mass shootings on besides guns.",
    "As Jezebels Laura Bassett noted, thats a pretty rich explanation given that you dont typically hear about mass shootings being carried out by women whove undergone abortions, probably because mass shootings are almost exclusively the domain of men, a not insignificant number of which are violent misogynists (and racists and antisemites, etc).",
    "In a sane country that actually valued human lives, last weeks mass shooting in Texasor, the one before that in Buffalo, or thousands before that in the years priorwould have marked the moment the elected officials whove refused to pass gun control legislation looked in the mirror and decided to stop being part of the problem.",
    "Asked by host Branden Rathert if Is there any appetite in D.C. amongst Republicans to look at doing some things differently as it relates to guns, Long responded that No one has been able to come up with any kind of suggestion that would have helped in any of these situations fact-check: false!",
    "Elsewhere in conservative bullshit re: guns, on Wednesday, Doug Mastriano, the Pennsylvania GOP nominee for governor, shared and doubled down on a 2018 video of him likening gun control to the policies of Adolf Hitler.",

    "(Just so its clear: The actual reason that more mass shootings occur in the U.S. than any other wealthy country the answerthe only answeris the astronomical number of guns in this country.)",
    "Its appalling to me any time theres a shooting, the left will jump on that as a way to advance an agenda to remove our right to bear arms, Mastriano says in the clip.",
    "So far, thats included too many doors; not enough God ; pot; single moms; unarmed teachers; and schools being designed without trip wires and man traps.",
    "If Long and his ilk were actually serious about preventing thousands of Americans being killed by guns every year, they might wonder why.",
    "The U.K. legalized abortion five years before the U.S., yet strangely, it doesnt seem to have the same problem with mass shootings.",
    "Now we have two, three, four a week in Springfield, Missouri, so something has happened to our society and I go back to abortion.",
    "When we decided it was okay to murder kids in their mothers wombs, life has no value to a lot of these folks.",
    "Unfortunately, theyre trying to blame inanimate objects for all of these tragedies, he said.",
    "and that passing gun control measures is not the solution to the epidemic of gun violence.",
    "Then he added: When I was growing up in Springfield, you had one or two murders a year.",
    "Hint: It doesnt have to do with clotted cream or corgis.",
    "We saw Hitler do the same thing in Germany in the 30s.",
