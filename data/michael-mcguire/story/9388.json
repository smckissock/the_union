    "Previously, Bulldogs general manager and Channel Nine commentator Phil Gould even suggested that Walker should be given time off from first grade after he was hammered in a heavy 46-0 loss to the Melbourne Storm in 2021.",
    "'They've got to give him a spell, he's done a great job and he's a tremendous young talent, but they can't protect him for 80 minutes ... they have to protect him from himself,' Gould said at the time.",
