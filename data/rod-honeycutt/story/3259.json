    "I will not let that happen.?\nThe new district's constituents included the Tillises, and Susan Tillis responded on Twitter that the voters there didn't need any intervention and we are capable of making our own decisions.?\nMoore passed on running for the seat rather than take on Cawthorn.",
    "They shouldn't have been waiting until he accused them of having orgies,? said George Erwin, a former sheriff in Henderson County, N.C., who backed Cawthorn in 2020 and renounced him after he spoke to the Trump rally on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
    "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) responded that Cawthorn did not tell the truth? and described his actions as not becoming of a congressman.? The public rebuke was widely seen as McCarthy giving his blessing to other Republicans to attack Cawthorn in his primary.",
