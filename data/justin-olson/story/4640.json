    "Brnovich’s lengthy probe of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, which Trump narrowly lost to Democratic President Joe Biden, has brought increased pressure from his GOP rivals and Republican grassroots voters to do more than just issue his recent “interim report.” That report did not point to widespread fraud as Trump and many Arizona Republicans have baselessly claimed, but said there were “serious vulnerabilities” and “questions” about the election.",
    "“Well, he did a report, and he recites some of the many horrible things that happened in that very dark period of American history but, rather than go after the people that committed these election crimes, it looks like he is just going to ‘kick the can down the road’ and stay in that middle path of non-controversy,” Trump said in his statement.",

    "\"I understand his frustration, but as I've said previously, I will continue to follow the facts and evidence and do what the law requires,\" Brnovich said in a written statement.",
    "Because of the amount of time that it took him to do the report, which was endless, his poll numbers have been rapidly sinking,\" Trump said in a written statement.",
    "On Tuesday, Brnovich reacted to Trump's criticism, heaping praise on his efforts to secure the border and install many conservative judges on the federal bench.",
    "I will be making an Endorsement in the not too distant future!”\nBrnovich is running against four other Republicans seeking the GOP Senate nomination.",
