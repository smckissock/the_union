    "\"I’ve spent my life fighting for the conservative principles of President Donald Trump’s America First agenda, and I’m running for Congress in Nevada’s 1st District to help refocus the politicians in Washington on putting our own citizens and communities first,\" Brog said in a statement.",

    "She represented a safe Las Vegas-based seat before 2020, while Nevada had two other competitive but Republican-leaning congressional districts and one deep red district.",
    "Titus, D-Nev., is in the unenviable position of having her seat made significantly more competitive by redistricting while her own party controls the state government.",

    "Brog is the former executive director of the group Christians United for Israel.",
    "In the process, they made Titus' seat nearly evenly split along party lines too.",
