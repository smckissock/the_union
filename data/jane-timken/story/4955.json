    "While an early endorsement of Gibbons, Timken, or Mandel could have made a significant impact, a last-minute endorsement of Vance disheartens loyal Trump supporters who have donated their dollars, volunteered their time, and spent their political capital investing in proven Trump candidates.",
    "We have watched them travel the state not only promoting the president, but also supporting conservative local and statewide candidates who stand solidly with Donald J. Trump, while Vance was hanging out with establishment elites across the nation.",
    "Not only did The Washington Post report that the former president got so many phone calls after endorsing Vance that he stopped taking them, I am also hearing reports of trouble recruiting volunteers to work his upcoming rally in Delaware.",
    "But when you take a Johnny-come-lately and elevate him above your proven foot soldiers, you undermine your own reputation of loyalty to those who have poured their own blood, sweat and tears into your agenda.",
    "The bottom line is that an endorsement now, especially for Vance, sends a signal to every candidate and elected official that loyalty doesn’t matter and neither does opposition.",
    "Gary Click is the lead pastor at the Fremont Baptist Temple of Fremont, Ohio and is serving his first term in the Ohio House of Representatives for Ohio’s 88 district.",
    "Vance's political career might have been raised from the dead when he suddenly announced that former President Donald Trump had, in fact, endorsed him for U.S. Senate.",
    "We know who has been touting the Trump agenda in our backyards since the day he glided down the elevator in Trump Tower, and it wasn’t the \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author.",
    "Whatever else you think of the president, he has been known for his loyalty and this undermines that image and is likely to dampen Trump enthusiasm in the future.",
    "I have had light conversation with him and was even afforded the opportunity to pray with him and other candidates at a Faith Wins event in Cincinnati.",
    "While I have personally endorsed Gibbons, I am committed to supporting whichever candidate emerges victorious on May 3, including Vance.",
    "Vance earned the ire of the president’s loyal followers with rhetoric that matched Hillary Clinton’s basket of deplorables comment.",
    "If Vance could earn the trust of conservative Ohioans on his own, then let bygones be bygones and move ahead for the common cause.",
    "He has not earned his street cred in Ohio, and Buckeyes are not likely to have his back either, despite the recent endorsement.",
    "The only result will be disappointing, disillusioning and discouraging a large section of the president’s loyal followers.",
    "But he should win because he has personally regained the trust of Ohio voters, not because of a presidential pardon.",
    "But until then, President Trump’s band of loyal buckeye believers will remain skeptical of Vance’s chances.",
    "See who is capable of becoming a champion on their own merits, then back the winner with all your might!",
    "They have seen them at their Lincoln Day Dinners, their monthly suppers, and central committee meetings.",
    "While Ohio is Trump country, conservatives in the Buckeye state have a habit of thinking for themselves.",
    "Mr. President, if you are taking the time to read this, the Ohio voters know that you like winners.",
    "That’s how we Make Ohio Great Again and set the precedent for Making America Great Again, again!",
    "But Vance might want to be careful about putting too much faith in his own resurrection story.",
    "I believe in forgiveness, and I believe that people can change their hearts and minds.",
    "\"Donald Trump is on the verge of poisoning the entire GOP brand for years,\" he said.",
    "This quenches the fire of Trump enthusiasm in his base and sets a bad precedent.",
    "These are familiar names up and down every highway and byway of the heartland.",
    "That is when loyal supporters begin to lose faith and trust begins to erode.",
    "We know who has been putting the work in throughout Ohio’s 88 counties.",
    "All that one needs is a quick campaign conversion, and they are good.",
    "Ohio voters didn’t have to watch Fox News to get a glimpse of them.",
    "Vance has reinvented himself, apologized and done his penance.",
    "Ohioans know Mike Gibbons, Jane Timken, and Josh Mandel.",
    "We can already see the effects of it on the ground.",
    "That is one of the many traits that appeals to us.",
    "So please, reconsider and let this race play out.",
    "You value candidates who can do it on their own.",
    "Vance has not been in the trenches with us.",
    "Because of this, I find him reprehensible.",
