    "Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) has slammed the Department of Defense for ignoring his letters regarding a military health database that allegedly showed an increase in troop illnesses after the Biden administrationâ€™s military vaccine mandate began in August, detailing his concerns in a letter exclusively obtained Wednesday by Breitbart News.Attorney Thomas Renz, who is representing three DoD whistle blowers, presented findings from the database during a January 24 roundtable hosted by Johnson that showed a spike in the average number of troops diagnosed with miscarriages, myocarditis, cancer, and other serious illnesses from the period 2016-2020 compared to 2021."
