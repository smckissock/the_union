    "The Lopez campaign said Andrade is the first elected official to switch his endorsement to him from Hobbs.",
    "Hobbs announced Andrade’s endorsement last summer, about a month after entering the governor’s race.",
    "She has since acknowledged that discrimination took place and issued a public apology to Adams.",
    "But over the last several months, they said they’d lost faith in her ability to lead the state.",
    "Support high-quality local journalism and help underwrite independent news without the spin.",
    "Adams was a staffer under Hobbs, who at the time was Senate minority leader.",
    "They specifically cited Hobbs’ responsibility for Adams’ firing in 2015.",
