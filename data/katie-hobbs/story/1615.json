    "Former Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke has apparently done a complete 180-degree turn from at least one of his key stances on the 2020 campaign trail.During the Democratic primary, O’Rourke famously shouted from the debate stage, “Hell yes, I’m going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” And his passion on that specific issue was the reason that – at the rally where O’Rourke dropped out of the primary and endorsed President Joe Biden’s campaign — then-candidate Biden said that he’d be bringing O’Rourke along to help his administration with a gun control strategy.",
    "O’Rourke doubled down, saying that he still stood by that comment as recently as November of 2021."
