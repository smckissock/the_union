    "“There is too much evidence pointing towards irresponsible action for state leaders to ignore.”\nBrnovich violated professional conduct rules\nBrnovich’s behavior is so appalling that even the Republican-packed state Supreme Court is now revisiting ethics rules on public attorneys and prosecutors.",
    "Brnovich is desperate to ingratiate himself to Trump and his supporters, and will stop at nothing in that quest, including litigating anything on immigration and dismissing calls to investigate Arizona’s fake presidential electors, one of whom is his GOP rival Jim Lamon.",
    "House would have to start an inquiry\nFontes is asking House Speaker Rusty Bowers and Senate President Karen Fann to convene an inquiry of Brnovich for “his grotesque political self-service, abuse of office, and other bad acts.”\nHow would that happen?",
    "There’s a long list of public outcries over Brnovich shamelessly using his official position to gain the support of hard-core Trump Republicans who are still promoting the false idea that the 2020 election was stolen from the former president.",
    "The court’s shocking step came after ethics complaints filed against Brnovich accused him of violating rules for attorney conduct when he failed to represent the secretary of state and sued the Board of Regents, a group he also represents.",
    "Arizona judge rules that 'law enforcement' is NOT a profession If the Constitution means anything, kick Rep. Gosar off the ballot Does Ducey really think cops in Alaska can help secure our border?",
    "The AG's job is not to chase Trump's approval\nBrnovich is one of the state officials who supported certifing the 2020 presidential vote, which made him persona non grata among the Big-Lie crowd.",
    "Details of that deal remains confidential, but we know diversion is only for lawyers “who have violated the Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct.”\nAnd those are only the official grievances.",
    "Not just because impeaching a public official has been extremely rare in Arizona but also because the current legislative leaders simply don’t have the spine to go after one of their own.",
    "The House would need to start an inquiry and charge the person with “high crimes, misdemeanors or malfeasance in office.” The Senate would then conduct a trial to convict or acquit.",
    "Still, Democratic secretary of state candidate Adrian Fontes is right to ask legislative leaders to explore impeaching Brnovich, who’s seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate.",
    "“How many basic professional norms will he cast aside to chase headlines and the love of his party’s leader?”\nFor Brnovich, it appears, the sky is the limit.",
    "But he needs their vote to win the August GOP primary for the chance to challenge Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly in November.",
    "Asking Arizona Republican lawmakers to impeach Attorney General Mark Brnovich is like asking them to produce a unicorn.",
    "“Leadership for our state requires setting aside politics and just looking at the facts,” Fontes said in a statement.",
    "“How far will the Attorney General go to abuse his office to advance his personal political career?” Fontes asks.",
    "But that brings back to the lack of political will of the Republican-controlled Legislature.",
    "On top of that, Brnovich reached a diversion agreement with the State Bar of Arizona.",
    "Trump has called him “lackluster” but has yet to endorse anyone in the race.",
    "Elvia Díaz is an editorial columnist for The Republic and azcentral.",
    "Reach her at 602-444-8606 or elvia.diaz@arizonarepublic.com.",
    "It’s a political process, not a criminal one.",
    "Follow her on Twitter, @elviadiaz1.",
    "Arizona deserves better."
