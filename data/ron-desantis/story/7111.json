    "Florida  Reynolds American's second most popular target for political contributions in 2021, according to its own data  is an example of a state that passed legislation in 2021 preventing local communities from changing the minimum age of using and possessing tobacco as well as regulating the marketing and sale of the product.",
    "Tobacco companies, including Reynolds American and affiliates, have since donated more than $20 million dollars to the California Coalition for Fairness, which opposes the legislature's decision and succeeded in getting the issue of flavored tobacco onto the ballot for the 2022 midterm elections.",
    "In addition to donating to the coalition, Reynolds American's political spending document reveals extensive contributions to the campaigns of individual lawmakers across California, donating $161,500 to the candidates in 2021 alone, more than two-thirds of which went to Republican candidates.",
    "But the data provides a glimpse into how the nation's second-largest tobacco company is attempting to broadly influence lawmakers and otherwise participate in low-profile elections that may nevertheless have notable policy implications for companies that market smoking products.",
    "Both Myers and Callaway told Insider that Reynolds American has historically been a supporter of tobacco \"preemption\" laws, or working with state governments to pass legislation making it harder for local communities from implementing their own tobacco control legislation.",
    "While Reynolds American and its parent company, British American Tobacco, have both pledged to reduce \"the health impact of our business\" and cut down on combustible products, they also fight against lawmakers trying to codify anti-tobacco and vaping measures, he said.",
    "Cathy Callaway, the senior director of prevention for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network's state and local campaigns team, told Insider that the company's focus on Washington, DC, best exemplifies the organization's grip on the federal government.",

    "\"The DC numbers, to me, speaks to the investments they're making in Congress, probably around FDA regulation of tobacco products and certainly the recent rule that was proposed by FDA to end the sale of, or to prohibit menthol and flavored cigars.\"",
    "Reynolds American alone has spent $2.56 million to lobby the federal government in 2021 and is on pace to spend $2.8 million in lobbying, according to federal congressional lobbying data compiled by nonpartisan research organization OpenSecrets.",
    "But one tobacco giant  Reynolds American  is actively spreading millions of dollars to hundreds of state-level political candidates and political action committees, according to an internal corporate governance document reviewed by Insider.",

    "Insider reached out to more than 25 of the candidates who received money from Reynolds American, but none were willing to speak on the record about their Reynolds American-related contributions.",
    "Much at stake for Big Tobacco\nIn 2021, the FDA announced its intention to prevent \"future generations of smokers\" by banning menthol cigarettes, flavored cigars, and other similar products.",
    "\"Reynolds claims that it's no longer opposing tobacco control measures because it too supports a smoke-free future, but its political giving tells a completely different story,\" Myers said.",
    "Menthol in cigarettes and flavored cigars could soon be outlawed, as the US Food and Drug Administration and state legislatures carefully prepare to regulate or legislate them into history.",
    "\"The proposed rules would help prevent children from becoming the next generation of smokers and help adult smokers quit,\" said Xavier Becerra, the Health and Human Services secretary.",
    "Reynolds American favored conservatives in its political giving, with more than 80% of its 2021 contributions  more than $5 million  going to Republican candidates and committees.",
    "But Reynolds American, in a posting on its website, explained its political donations are \"consistent with the interests of their businesses\" and guiding principles and beliefs.",
    "\"They've always used giving to prevent meaningful tobacco control legislation from passing, and this demonstrates that there has been no decrease in that whatsoever,\" he said.",

    "Despite assurances from the company that it's moving away from combustible tobacco products, Myers said the company's political spending is simply \"business as usual.\"",
    "\"Contributions must be lawful, and in the interests of the organization rather than the individual interests of any employee, officer, or director,\" the website says.",
