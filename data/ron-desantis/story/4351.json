    "In addition, according to Vox, Biden administration appointees at the FTC and Justice Department are aiming to do more: They have Big Tech in their sights.? Vox adds, We havent seen this kind of test of the tech sector since the United States sued Microsoft for antitrust violations in 1998.?\nUncle Sams suit against Microsoft was, indeed, a big deal, and yet interestingly enough, it still left Microsoft as a big deal; it is currently the second-most valuable company in America, boasting a market capitalization of some $2.17 trillion.",
    "That is, if you arent a player in the process, youre the one being played.? As I wrote further, One possible answer is a Federal Platform Commission (FPC), overseeing Big Techs common-carrier responsibilities; and this FPC could be an outgrowth of the existing Federal Communications Commission (FCC).?\nIts worth noting that, by statute, the FCC must allocate at least two of its five commissioner slots to the Republican Partyand thats two more seats at the table than the GOP has, at present, at any Big Tech company.",
    "On April 18, seven former national security officialsfrom both parties, from both the legislative and executive branchesreleased an open letter in which they warned against tinkering with Big Tech:\nLegislation from both the House and Senate requiring non-discriminatory access for all business users (broadly defined to include foreign rivals) on U.S. digital platforms would provide an open door for foreign adversaries to gain access to the software and hardware of American technology companies.",
    "The best-known proposal is the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, sponsored by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) In her words,\nThis bill prohibits certain large online platforms from engaging in specified acts, including giving preference to their own products on the platform, unfairly limiting the availability on the platform of competing products from another business, or discriminating in the application or enforcement of the platforms terms of service among similarly situated users.",
    "The GOP might take a tip from pro-Trump conservative activist Scott Presler, who argued in an April 25 tweet that no matter what happens with Musk and Twitter, We must still legislate an Internet Bill of Rights,? which would declare It is illegal & unconstitutional for social media companies to work w/ the White House to silence political opposition.?\nWhether or not Twitter sells itself to Elon Musk,\nwe must still legislate an Internet Bill of Rights.",
    "Without a doubt, Musk as a social-media owner is reassuring to most conservatives; as he declared in an April 25 tweet, Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.? Indeed, conservative accounts have already been gaining ground on the platform, even as Musk ascends into the conservative pantheon.",
    "And so its right and proper that Americans seek structural change, beyond any personality; last year The Wall Street Journal reported on a poll showing that 80 percent of Americans (83 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of Republicans) agreed that the federal government needs to do everything it can to curb the influence of big tech companies that have grown too powerful.? So a change is gonna come.",
    "Back in February, War on the Rocks took a deep dive:\nWhile a defense metaverse could enable a range of discrete warfighting and social benefits, its true value should emerge through the interconnection of the various defense virtual worlds  provided interoperability is prioritized in the design of these virtual environments from the start.",
    "So prospects for Klobuchars legislation are uncertain; the Post says merely that the bill may survive,? and Punchbowl News, an insider publication, adds that its passage is a possibility.?

    "This nail of a point has been further hammered in omnipresent online advertising by a new tech group, the Chamber of Progress; it presents itself as sort of cuddly and liberal, but nevertheless it delivers a hard-edged hawkish national security message.",
