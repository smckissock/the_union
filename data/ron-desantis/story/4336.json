    "To pick and choose which school boards and which elected officials you want to punish by shorting their terms, why thats fundamentally a violation of the way this process works.?\nPolitical observers note that Youngkin made this attempt knowing it would fail in the Democratic Senate  and perhaps with Loudoun voters if early elections had been ordered, given that the county overwhelmingly supported Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor who was seeking a comeback, over Youngkin.",
    "Recall petitions create more turmoil and conflict,? Stanley said, adding: Quite frankly, I think it is well and good for democracy to have these amendments occur so we can get very competent people who love their community to go in there with an open mind and an open heart.?\nSuetterlein, the lone Republican to vote against the amendment, took issue with Democrats harshest claims that the proposal was anti-democratic.",
    "For governors to be getting involved in changing the rules in a local election  it just runs counter to all of the goals we have for how elections and democracies are supposed to run.?\nYoungkin attempted to amend a routine bill aimed at enabling the Loudoun County School Board to stagger its terms of office, which had passed the House unanimously and cleared the Senate with no opposition and one abstention.",
    "But Simon pressed Gilbert about whether it was special? under a different part of the constitution  Article 4, Section 14  that states the General Assembly cannot enact targeted, special legislation that involves registering voters, conducting elections, or designating the places of voting.?\nIf you can [rule] under Section 12, why in the world wouldnt you do so under Section 14?? Simon asked.",
    "The Governor thinks theres no one better to decide the fate of the school board members than the voters in Loudoun County.?\nControversy over the Loudoun County School Board and its handling of issues related to race, gender and two sexual assaults fired up the base of the Republican Party last year and helped power Youngkins win in what had been an increasingly blue state.",
    "How on earth does it undermine the will of the electorate to give the voters an opportunity to vote??\nSen. William M.

    "But the Democratic-controlled Senate killed it, with one Republican senator joining the vote against a measure he called troubling.?\nWe cant just get to a place where, because we so oppose someone, were going to unilaterally shorten their term,? Sen. David R. Suetterlein (R-Roanoke) said in an interview Friday.",
    " He ran worse than [Ken] Cuccinelli in Loudoun,? said longtime Richmond political analyst Bob Holsworth, referring to the conservative firebrand McAuliffe defeated in 2013.\nLoudoun has become this cultural trope that has more of an impact outside of the county than inside the county,? Holsworth said.",
    "And fixed terms are a major part of that.?\nThe Loudoun County School Board, which had opposed the change in its elections, issued a statement thanking the Senate for supporting the voters of Loudoun County? and rejecting the Governors attempt to usurp their Constitutional authority.?\nDel.",

    "Marcus Simon (D-Fairfax) asked House Speaker Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) to make a parliamentary ruling on that very issue, asking whether the amendment should be classified as special? legislation, a legal term meaning it is aimed at specific individuals or small groups.",
    "Glenn Youngkins attempt to force the entire Loudoun County School Board to face new elections this fall, shortening the terms of most of its members, stunned many state political observers as an intrusion into local election integrity without modern precedent in Virginia.",
    "Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor who oversaw the drafting of the latest version of the Virginia Constitution, adopted in 1971, called Youngkins amendment a troubling proposal,? and said it was likely without modern precedent.",
    "Victor, the GMU political scientist, said she sees irony in the situation  Youngkin, who ran in part on a pledge to ensure election integrity and has made empowering parents his mantra, now attempting to cast aside a valid election.",
    "So Youngkin, who during the campaign balanced his appeals to Trumps base by ducking some hot-button issues and playing up his suburban basketball-dad persona, is leaning harder than ever into those divisive topics, Farnsworth said.",

    "For any elected official to embark on policies that actually result in the harm, the physical harm, of a child  nay, two children  then they should be out of office,? he said in a heated floor speech.",
    "It wasnt close.?\nBut wading into Loudouns K-12 culture wars helped Youngkin fire up the Trump base in other parts of the state, where they shattered turnout records and helped carry him to victory.",
    "House and Senate Republicans charged that Democrats had done essentially the same thing as Youngkin when they passed a law last year changing the date of local elections from May to November.",
    "The first problem, Howard said, is that the Virginia Constitution lays out zones of authority? over education among the state Board of Education, local school boards and the General Assembly.",
    "From a democracy standpoint, its just bad,? said Jennifer Victor, a political scientist at George Mason University whose area of study includes elections and legislative organizations.",

    "They need to be swept aside.?\nWhen Sen. Joseph D. Morrissey (D-Richmond) suggested the proper way to seek early removal is instead with a recall petition, Stanley said no.",
    "What worked for the governor to get elected in Virginia  being somewhat vague on policy  isnt as useful when it comes to building your national profile,? Farnsworth said.",

    "And when youre competing against Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott for national Republican attention, shooting hoops isnt going to cut the mustard.?",

    "This is legitimately trying to usurp the authority of local governments to run their own elections,? Victor said.",
