    "Just as he apparently sought to reorder the lawful transfer of power in America on Jan. 6, so he seems to signal now his willingness to restructure the world order.",
    "But hes always been good at coding his tantalizing offers to unsavory types, as well as his threats to anyone who opposes him, including by reference to the past.",
    "Hes no war hero.? Trump said, I like people who werent captured,? referring to McCains imprisonment by the North Vietnamese after his plane was downed in 1967.",
