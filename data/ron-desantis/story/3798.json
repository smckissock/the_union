    "Students across Florida protest \"Don't Say Gay\" bill 02:36\nIn an email Tuesday, Seminole County Public Schools spokesman Michael Lawrence said the issue wasn't with the protest but how its depiction in the yearbook could be interpreted as being endorsed by the school, which would be in violation of the school board's policy.",
    "Critics condemn Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" law 04:59\n\"This really shouldn't be happening because all we did as journalists was document what was happening at our school on our campus,\" Skye Tiedemann, one of the yearbook's editors-in-chief, told the Sentinel.",
    "Lyman High School Principal Michael Hunter said in a statement Monday that \"pictures and descriptions\" documenting a student walk-out in March in response to Florida's Parental Rights in Education law should have been \"caught earlier in the review process.\"",
    "\"Rather than reprinting the yearbook at substantial cost and delay, we have elected to cover that material that is out of compliance with board policy so that yearbooks can be distributed as soon as possible,\" the principal's statement said.",
    "When asked what would have needed editing, Lawrence said, \"specifically making it clear that this particular event was a 'student'-led event that was not sponsored, endorsed, or promoted by the district or school would've solved the issue.\"",
    "School officials determined that the least costly solution would be to cover up that section so that the yearbooks could still be distributed to seniors before graduation and the rest of the student body prior to summer break, he said.",
    "\"Students were empowered to craft a yearbook that reflects their lived experience of the academic year and did so with professionalism  sharing a piece of history on Lyman's campus, one that should be reflected upon,\" Eskamani said.",
    "Yearbooks at a central Florida high school won't be distributed until images of students holding rainbow flags and a \"love is love\" sign while protesting the state's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law can be covered up.",
    "The yearbook's faculty advisor Danielle Pomeranz told the Orlando Sentinel that she was asked to check into putting stickers over the photos and captions depicting the walkout.",
    "Lawrence noted that the yearbook dedicates a separate page to the school's Gay Straight Alliance Club and elsewhere shows students at a pride march and holding rainbow flags.",
    "Rep. Carlos G. Smith, a Democrat who is the state's first LGBTQ Latino legislator, tweeted that the \"censorship is a direct result of the law these students were protesting.",
    "\"If these items were caught earlier prior to print, some simple editing/tweaking likely could've occurred to make that section in compliance prior to print.\"",
    "State Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from the Orlando area, said in a letter to school board members that she was disappointed by the decision.",
    "Tiedemann told WKMG that students were supposed to have a party Monday to have yearbooks signed by their classmates, but that was canceled.",
    "Students at the school in Longwood, which is near Orlando, have created a hashtag \"#stopthestickers,\" which is circulating on social media.",
    "Ron DeSantis, bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.",
    "They also planned a peaceful protest at Tuesday night's meeting of the Seminole County School Board, WKMG reported.",
    "\"The issue at hand here is not the photos or the topic for which the students were protesting,\" Lawrence said.",
    "District officials said they don't want anyone thinking that the school supported the students' walkout.",
    "DeSantis frequently refers to the \"free state of Florida\" in his news conferences.",
    "She said it would cost $45,000 to reprint the 600 yearbooks.",
    "He said those depictions do comply with the policy.",
    "#WeWillNotBeErased in this so-called 'free state.'\"",
    "The bill, signed into law by Republican Gov.",
    "\"To have that covered up isn't right.",
    "This is censorship.\"",
    "\"Not censored.\"",
