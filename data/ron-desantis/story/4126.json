    "From @EducationFL on math textbooks for Florida schools: Publishers are aligning their instructional materials to state standards and removing woke content, allowing the department to add 17 more books to the state adoption list over the past 14 days.? ggg\n Christina Pushaw g? gg (@ChristinaPushaw) May 3, 2022\nPalelis said this is the same process as previous instructional materials adoptions and that the FLDOE will continue to give publishers the opportunity to remediate all deficiencies identified during the review to ensure the broadest selection of high quality instructional materials are available to the school districts and Floridas students.?\nWe hope to add instructional materials to the state adoption list as additional publishers address our concerns and meet our standards,? she concluded.",
    "The FLDOE announced on April 15 that it had rejected 41% of math textbooks proposed by publishers for public instruction because they contained indoctrinating concepts? such as Critical Race Theory (CRT), Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and Common Core, which are prohibited by the state according to the Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking (B.E.S.T.)",
    "We have high standards and reject books with unacceptable content because we know that publishers can easily adjust their materials to meet our guidelines, as displayed by the fact that it took less than two weeks for additional publishers to amend entire books, resubmit them and get put on the adoption list,? Palelis told the DCNF.",
    "Examples included a graph that measured racial prejudice according to political identification that showed conservatives are reportedly more racist than liberals and multiple social-emotional learning,? activities, which critics have argued is a loophole to repackage CRT and disseminate the material throughout public schools.",
