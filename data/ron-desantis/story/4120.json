    "For purposes of future case law under the concept of substantive due process, which undergirds Roe, Alitos reasoning boils down to two factors: That there is no express right to abortion in the actual Constitution and that, in 1791 when the 14th Amendments Due Process Clause was ratified, there werent widespread legal rights to abortion, either.",

    "The Mississippi law clashes with the landmark cases Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v.

    "The shadow docket? decision in Texas Whole Womens Health v. Jackson, issued without full briefing, oral argument or explanation, was yet another nail in the coffin of the courts legitimacy as a non-ideological institution that adheres to the rule of law.",
    "Women living at or under the federal poverty level (that is, single households earning $11,200 per year or less) are twice as likely not to use contraception, three times more likely to become pregnant and five times more likely to give birth.",

    "Alitos breezy answer to these womens plight  seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office?  is both cynical and callous.",
    "Alito acknowledges these links, but blithely waves them off on the rationale that abortion uniquely involves potential life?  another vague concept that has no grounding in the Constitution itself.",
