    "| Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images\nBy Arek Sarkissian\n 06/01/2022 02:49 PM EDT\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla.  A coalition of abortion rights groups on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in state court to block Floridas new 15-week abortion ban, arguing the law threatens doctors with jail time and violates privacy rights that are enshrined in the state Constitution.",
    "One of the plaintiffs in the case, Jacksonville abortion provider Shelly Tien, wrote in a statement that Floridas 15-week abortion ban, which only allows for an exemption in extreme medical cases, fails to account for a much wider spectrum of illnesses where pregnancy could jeopardize a persons life.",
    "Absent an injunction, the Act will prevent Floridians from exercising their fundamental constitutional right to decide whether to have an abortion prior to viability, causing irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law, the lawsuit states.",
    "The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida on behalf of two regional Planned Parenthood offices and six abortion providers, was widely expected after the Republican-controlled Legislature approved the ban and GOP Gov.",
    "But Floridas Supreme Court now leans much more conservative  DeSantis has appointed three of the current justices  and theres a fear among abortion rights providers that the high court could interpret the privacy right differently.",
    "The new law is the strictest abortion law in state history and mirrors a ban in Mississippi that is at the center of a case, Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, on which the Supreme Court is set to rule.",
    "The defendants in the lawsuit include state Surgeon General Joseph A. Ladapo, state Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Simone Marstiller and top prosecutors from judicial circuits across the state.",
    "With the U.S. Supreme Court threatening to take away the federal right to abortion, we will do everything in our power to block this cruel attack on Floridians fundamental right to get the care they need.",
    "The abortion rights groups that filed the lawsuit in Leon County Circuit Court argue the states constitutional privacy right was expressly written to block government from intruding on private lives.",
    "The Supreme Court has indicated that it will likely overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision that protects abortion rights, according to an initial draft opinion first reported by POLITICO.",
    "When it comes to pregnancy, birth, and parenting, patients and their families make the best decisions for themselves and their loved ones, consistent with their values and beliefs, Tien wrote.",
    "Everyone should have the fundamental right to make these deeply personal decisions that profoundly impact the arc of their lives within the privacy of the physician-patient relationship.",
    "The state Supreme Court cited the privacy amendment when it struck down a law more than three decades ago that required minors to get parental permission to get an abortion.",
    "Not only does HB 5 defy the will of the people, it ignores the real life circumstances of people who need an abortion and deliberately puts them in harms way, Tilley said.",
    "But incoming legislative leaders held back on voicing support for the total ban, instead saying the issue should be left for the 160-member Legislature to decide.",
    "The complaint, which was filed just after noon, asks a judge to temporarily halt the ban from taking effect next month until a jury trial can take place.",
    "Ladapos role and AHCA fall under the purview of the governors office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.",
    "ACLU of Florida Legal Director Daniel Tilley wrote in a statement that the new law, known as HB 5, blocks women from essential abortion care.",
    "Ahead of the Supreme Courts decision, Florida Republicans are considering several possibilities, including a complete ban on abortions.",
    "The law, which provides no exemptions for victims of rape, incest and human trafficking, is set to go into effect on July 1.",
    "Before the recent law was approved, Florida prohibited abortions at 24 weeks.",
    "Before the recent law was approved, Florida prohibited abortions at 24 weeks.",
    "More than 79,000 women received abortions in Florida last year.",
    "More than 79,000 women received abortions in Florida last year.",
    "Ron DeSantis signed it into law on April 14.",
    "And the 15-week prohibition goes too far."
