    "On the question of the wars endgame and the nuclear peril, however, you could see our challenges distilled  with Grygiel emphasizing the importance of Ukraines recovering territory in the east and along the Black Sea coastline in order to be plausibly self-sufficient in the future, but then the more hawkish Heinrichs and the more cautious Colby sparring over what our posture should be in the event that rapid Ukrainian advances are met with a Russian tactical nuclear strike.",
    "But since we are arming the Ukrainians on a scale that seems intended to make a counteroffensive possible, I sincerely hope a version of the Colby-Heinrichs back-and-forth is happening at the highest reaches of our government  before an issue that matters now on academic panels becomes the most important question in the world.",
    "This is the future that the Ukrainian military claims is within reach  where with sufficient military aid and hardware they are able to turn their modest counteroffensives into major ones and push the Russians back not just to prewar lines but potentially out of Ukrainian territory entirely.",
    "More of the same, then, seems to be the Russian plan  meaning a continuation of the grinding war in Ukraines south and east, with the goal of regime change essentially abandoned in favor of the goal of holding territory that might eventually be integrated into the Russian Federation.",
    "So its not clear that either the Biden administration or the Zelensky government would be wise to invest in a long-term strategy for a frozen conflict that requires sustained bipartisan support  and perhaps soon enough the backing of a Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis administration.",
    "When Vladimir Putin came out to inspect the military parades and intercontinental ballistic missiles, there was neither a declaration of pseudovictory nor an announcement of escalation that would have put all Russia on a war footing and begun mass conscriptions for the front.",
    "Despite some reckless braggadocio about our role in taking down Russian targets, we have steadily escalated our support for Ukraine  including the $40 billion package that will probably clear the Senate next week  without provoking reckless escalation from Russia in response.",
    "But then the alternative  a permanent stalemate thats always poised for a return to low-grade war  would also leave Ukraine mutilated and weakened, reliant on streams of Western money and military equipment, and less able to confidently rebuild.",
    "Under those circumstances, any lasting peace deal would probably require conceding Russian control over some conquered territory, in Crimea and the Donbas, if not the land bridge now mostly held by Russian forces in between.",
    "The risk that a proxy war would encourage Moscow to climb the ladder toward a larger conflict has been manifest in the constant saber-rattling on Russian state TV  but not, thus far, in the actual choices of the Kremlin.",
    "Combine those realities with a world where the Russians are suddenly being routed, their territorial gains evaporating, and you have the most nuclear-shadowed military situation since our naval blockade of Cuba in 1962.",
    "Ive been turning over these dilemmas since I moderated a recent panel at the Catholic University of America with three right-of-center foreign policy thinkers  Elbridge Colby, Rebeccah Heinrichs and Jakub Grygiel.",
    "Last week brought a little clarity to the fog of the Ukraine war: The significant date of May 9, the celebration of the Soviet Unions victory over Hitlers Germany, came and went with no change of Russian strategy.",
    "Clearly, this is the future America should want  except for the extremely important caveat that its also the future where Russian nuclear escalation suddenly becomes much more likely than it is right now.",
    "In the first, Russia and Ukraine trade territory in small increments, and the war gradually cools into a frozen conflict? in a style familiar from other wars in Russias near abroad.",
    "Putin obviously doesnt like our armaments flowing into Ukraine, but he appears willing to fight the war on these terms rather than gambling at more existential stakes.",
    "This would hand Moscow a clear reward for its aggression, notwithstanding everything else that Russia has lost in the course of its invasion.",
    "And depending on how much territory was ceded, it would leave Ukraine mutilated and weakened, notwithstanding its military success.",
    "And already, the pro-Ukraine united front in the United States is fracturing a little over the sheer scale of what were sending.",
    "We know that Russian military doctrine envisions using tactical nuclear weapons defensively, to turn the tide in a losing war.",
    "That question isnt the one immediately before us; it will only become an issue if Ukraine begins to make substantial gains.",
    "There is another scenario, however, in which this dilemma diminishes because the stalemate breaks in Ukraines favor.",
    "We should assume that Putin and his circle regard total defeat in Ukraine as a regime-threatening scenario.",
    "On the wisdom of our support for Ukraine up till now, the panel was basically united.",
    "From the American perspective, this looks like strategic vindication.",
    "So such a deal might seem unacceptable in Kyiv, Washington or both.",
    "Our success, however, yields new strategic dilemmas.",
    "Two scenarios loom for the next six months of war."
