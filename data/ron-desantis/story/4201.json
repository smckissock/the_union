    "Here they are saying how important they are that they are somehow these paragons of truth, yet they are lying about something that is readily verifiable.?\nDeSantis name was included in the events program even though he was not in attendance, and The Daily Shows Trevor Noah, who performed at the dinner, made it seem as though DeSantis was in the audience before a string of jokes focused on the governors rivalry with former President Donald Trump.",
    "I see you, player.?\nThe roughly two minutes of DeSantis-focused ribbing played on the perceived tension between the two, including the fact that Trump was trying to encourage people to get the Covid-19 vaccine in January, and calling politicians who would not say if they got the booster shot gutless.? DeSantis has publicly sidestepped questions about his booster status.",

    "Yeah, Ive seen what youve been doing, blaming Trump for the lockdowns, distancing yourself from the vaccines that Trump created with his own two hands,? Noah said.",
