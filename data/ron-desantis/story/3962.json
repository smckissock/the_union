    "Ron DeSantis (R) doubled down on Friday, warning that the state will not subsidize? Disneys corporate speech? and vowed that the woke company is not going to have its own government in Florida.?\nSpeaking at a press conference, where he announced the biggest tax relief package in the states history, DeSantis pointed to other wins the state has racked up, including leading the effort in the country to make sure that our school system is for education, not for indoctrination.?\nThat involves things like making sure every parent in Florida has the right to access the curriculum thats being used in their kids school,? he said, explaining that the far-left has fought against his administration on that issue:\nWe want to make sure that were focusing on teaching kids to get the right answer and not being diverted by ideologies and other type of stuff that really isnt pertinent in any of this.",
    "Anyone that tells you differently is not being honest about it,? he said, adding that they will outline the proposals in the coming weeks and months.?\nDisney has continued to pay the price, literally, for making it clear that it does not respect parental rights, as Walt Disney Co. lost nearly $63 billion in market capitalization since coming out against Floridas Parental Rights in Education bill, which protects children in kindergarten through third grade from classroom discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity.",
    "Theres one company thats headquartered in Burbank, California that didnt agree with that,? he said, referencing his administrations war with Disney and making it clear that we run this state, they do not run this state.?\nWere going to do whats right for parents,? he said, adding that it is not the responsibility of Florida citizens to subsidize your corporate speech.?\nAs a result, the legislature took action to dissolve Disneys special taxing district, sparking outcry from leftists.",
    "Disney is going to have to live under the same laws that everybody else lives under in Florida.?\nDisney will pay its fair share of taxes, and Disney is going to be responsible for all the debt it has racked up.",
    "And then obviously we believe, you know, parents have the right to send their kids to like kindergarten without having a lot of this sexual content injected into the curriculum.",
    "At the end of the day, Disney is not going to have its own government in Florida,? he vowed.",
    "And, you know, I think parents overwhelmingly agree with that.",
    "That will happen.",
    "Florida Gov."
