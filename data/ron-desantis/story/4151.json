    "Understanding our nation's history, fully grasping what led desperate men to give their lives to separate church and state, and why they took up arms to defend the right to criticize the government, is the only way to appreciate the First Amendment: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\" To understand the historical underpinnings of the First Amendment is to revere it for the stroke of genius, timeless insight into human conduct, and beacon for universal freedom that it was.",
    "DeSantis and the GOP's own statements render obvious their lust for retaliation, and make clear that they moved against Disney in direct consequence of Disney's politically motivated speech against \"Don't say gay\":\nDeSantis: \"Disney and other woke corporations won't get away with peddling their unchecked pressure campaigns any longer (We) view corporations like Disney trying to impose a woke ideology on our state as a significant threat we take a very big stand against that If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy.\"",
    "Based on our founders' mistrust of governmental power, the premier and most exalted amendment to the U.S. Constitution was crafted to protect against the government's \"attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints,\" and soundly \"prohibits the government from restricting speech based on content of that speech,\" as the court wrote in U.S. v. Playboy Entertainment Group (2000), which struck down content-based restrictions.",
    "Similarly, here Republicans seek to punish Disney, a corporation that has significantly benefitted Florida, that led the meteoric rise of Florida's tourism industry and that employs more Floridians than any other private company in the state, specifically and demonstrably because of its disfavored political speech criticizing DeSantis and the \"Don't say gay\" legislation.",

    "Republican Rep. Randy Fine, who sponsored the bill to strip Disney of its status: \"When Disney kicked the hornet's nest several weeks ago (by criticizing 'Don't say gay'), we started looking at special districts This is something that makes sense to do in general but because of the way Disney has behaved, there's now the political will to do it.\"",

    "Disney released a statement that the bill \"should never have been signed into law Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that.",
    "Since dissolution of the district will mean that the counties must provide services Disney used to provide, such as road maintenance, and will also require the two counties to absorb nearly $1 billion in Disney's debt, DeSantis clearly needs time to figure out who might pay for it.",
    "At the bill signing ceremony, DeSantis continued, \"You're (Disney) a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you're gonna marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state... We view that as a provocation, and we're going to fight back against that.\"",
