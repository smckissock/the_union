    "If I had to guess what the themes would be like, I would say Justice Breyer has historically expressed interest in this whole issue of the Ninth Amendment and enumerated unenumerated rights and whether its important in our country to have the Bill of Rights reflect not only those rights that are listed, but that there are many other rights that Americans enjoy that are not there and the litany of other things that the court over the years has found that arent specifically stated there.",
    "So I would say I do think that they may feel empowered in other areas related to gay rights but I dont think is sort of head-long run into Obergefell is very likely from this court, especially until we get at least some change in the lineup of justices on the conservative side because they have pledged explicitly not to really spread this beyond Roe v. Wade.",
    "The other people seem to think theres like a major breakdown of some sort at the court and that Roberts is sort of unable to exercise any real degree of leadership, finding himself in such escapades as refereeing mask disputes between Justice Sotomayor and Justice Gorsuch and now in this case finds himself sort of impotent, right?",
    "And its going to make it more difficult if there was a possibility that Chief Justice John Roberts was trying to sway one of the other conservatives to join him in some kind of more centrist position and opinion in this case that could conceivably have become the controlling opinion depending on how that process went.",
    "And if youre looking for arguments about the outrage and the perception of the courts reputation, the signal so far would be that youre most likely to get that from Justice Sotomayor, because shes the one who couldnt help herself but at arguments to say how will the court survive the stench of this on its reputation?",
    "You could also imagine a full throated decrying of the politicization of the court, of the way in which the Federalist Society and conservative politicians have strategized to bring about the end of Roe v. Wade and appear to have succeeded through the political process, sadly, taking the Supreme Court down with it.",
    "What I do think is that a decision like this one does give power and backing to people who are looking to contain that right, which means giving more power to people who are religiously motivated, who say they dont want to do business with folks that are having same-sex marriages or people that happen to be LGBT.",
    "So couldnt, as you alluded to, a very Republican state come out with a law that would be very restrictive of the rights of gay couples and that case make it up to the Supreme Court and then you have these same five justices who would rather be ideologically right and pure on the court than respect stare decisis?",
    "| Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo\nBy POLITICO Staff\n 05/06/2022 05:00 AM EDT\nThis week on Playbook Deep Dive, POLITICOs Peter Canellos talks with our own Josh Gerstein, who broke this weeks massive news that the Supreme Courts conservative majority has drafted an opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade.",
    "I think we mentioned that earlier in the show, but theres been a bunch of other decisions that are closely watched, especially among legal experts, on issues like Trumps effort to repeal the Dreamers program that Obama had set up, where Roberts crossed over and joined with the other side.",
    "Canellos: Just the contours of our conversation have been that there are five conservatives who have asserted themselves in terms of making a very strong, principled stance in this case, and that there are three liberals who can be presumed to write very scorched-earth dissents.",
    "Peter Canellos: Do you think that this will lock in the five justices who have taken this position against Roe v. Wade initially so that if they suddenly surprise everybody by coming out with a different decision, people will know who changed their mind?",
    "Its Justice Alito who wrote this opinion and now if any word in it is different than what appeared in the draft, analysts, Supreme Court watchers, soothsayers are going to examine it in great detail and say Why was this changed?? and Who prompted that?",
    "My gut tells me that it would be more likely to happen in an incremental way than to happen in the dramatic way that it appears that Roe v. Wade is going to go into the trash bin of history if this opinion is sustained over the next couple of weeks.",
    "Thats one of the fascinating things about seeing the draft opinion is all the defensive statements in it that seem to anticipate things that dissenters are likely to write that based on our reporting, they havent actually written yet.",
    "and Who asked for this?? You do sometimes see that kind of discussion of the Supreme Court, but that usually takes place 20 or 30 years after the decisions in question, when typically a justice dies and their papers become public.",
    "Or are there things that he can do to help to repair the court in the short term, to kind of undo this perception that they are, first of all, elite and unpoliced and second of all, that they are prone to political manipulation?",
    "One is a full throated defense of unenumerated rights and why privacy is essential to the Constitution and really try to take on the legal arguments in Alitos draft, assuming that that remains the majority opinion.",
    "I dont think her language in an opinion that would be responding to the court actually striking down Roe v. Wade is going to be any more reserved than her language was publicly at the arguments in December.",
    "If youre really going to say If its not in there, then you dont get it,? or were just going to leave it up to any state legislature to decide what they want to do, that could be a pretty sweeping decision.",
    "Some of the things that people take so much for granted, not just the ones Ive seen on the lists related to this opinion, but others like the right that you have an attorney if youre accused of a crime.",
    "One is that Roberts is trying as best he can to be a steady hand on the tiller and that things are not as bad as it might appear because opinion happened to leak out in a very, very contentious case.",
    "The decision saying that there was a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage does seem like it would be jeopardized by the kind of rationale that we see laid out in this draft opinion.",
    "As you very smartly informed us it has literally affected his votes in other cases, his belief that the court should have a degree of finality when it decides things and moves on things.",
    "The draft opinion, if it holds, would be the culmination of half a century of legal conservatives organizing around the idea that Roe was wrongly decided and needed to be reversed.",
    "They did sign on  or we believe theyve signed on  to this opinion and the language in it that says this applies only to abortion and nothing else, which does seem very defensive.",
    "Gerstein: Ive been talking to a lot of people who watch the court and track the court closely about this over the last couple of days and I hear two different schools of thought.",
    "In many of the cases, Justices Roberts and Kavanaugh and Barrett are kind of in play, and they come up in different combinations and they side with each other in different ways.",
    "You could argue and you imagine poor Chief Justice Roberts in the middle saying to the liberals Please dont dont tell everybody that the Supreme Court is discredited by this.",
    "Whereas when it comes to to gay rights, I mean, right now in Florida, we have the Dont Say Gay? issue, the law that is being passed by Ron DeSantis and the Republicans there.",
    "There certainly is of people being gay, but not of their of that right being recognized by any government in the United States until obviously sometime in the 20th century.",
    "That is sort of healthy, normal, operating of a moderate court, and that theres no great need to be alarmed that something is terribly wrong and going off the rails.",
    "Peter and Josh nerd out on everything from the history of the court, to potential implications of the draft opinion  both for the country and the judiciary itself.",
    "I guess I would say I would take your logic on other issues like interracial marriage, which also that was a right that was not recognized in the 1700s and 1800s.",
    "And this school of thought would say, you know, it isnt really a 6-3 court when you look at many of the decisions that have come out over the last year or two.",
    "[Chief Justice] Roberts position is maybe more sympathetic with the conservatives, but overwhelmingly hes concerned for the institution of the Supreme Court.",
    "But theres another wing on the right which has Justices Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas, who tend to take the most extreme conservative position in each case.",
    "And were still waiting to see what they do, to see the ways in which Alito and perhaps Alitos conservative colleagues tried to preempt those arguments.",
    "Canellos: Couldnt some of these things happen sort of accidentally if a case went before the Supreme Court, even if the public had accepted something?",
    "Well in the 1800s, nobody was talking about gay marriage and all sorts of unspeakable things were being done to people that were thought to be gay.",
    "I dont see the conservative movement trying to make a big push in the next 15, 20 years to overturn gay marriage, in part because its so popular.",
    "But whats the point if hes the only justice in the middle of the court trying to assign an opinion to himself that no one else is going to join.",
    "So hes had a series of decisions not strictly involving Obamacare where hes taken a more moderate view that annoyed other members of the court.",
    "Like some people have pointed out, the Republican Party platform says we disagree with this decision and think it should be overturned.",
    "But I would agree with you that theres no appetite now on the left, on the right or anything to try to make any movement on that area.",
    "So I think you see an empowerment of those sorts of decisions that could contain or cut back that right, more than the likelihood.",
    "Thats not in the Constitution  its something that the court said and derived from other things like due process or what have you.",
    "This is the first time in modern history that the public has seen a Supreme Court draft decision while a case was still pending.",
    "Josh Gerstein: Everybodys in a different position post-Mondays release of this draft opinion by POLITICO than they were before.",
    "I think you probably will have Kagan engage more about the legal underpinnings of Roe and make more arguments on the legality.",
    "But I happen to think that the conservatives probably are fairly annoyed with Roberts and are bearing a number of grievances.",
    "I mean, the way the polling numbers turned around on gay marriage as those issues went before the Supreme Court are stunning.",
    "The court isnt where it was five years ago or ten years ago or 20 years ago, which is when Roberts came in as chief justice.",
    "Because you have a six justice conservative majority, which hes ostensibly part of, but he doesnt agree on taking down Roe.",
    "It could be the case that each of the liberal justices writes a dissent and they probably all join in each others dissents.",
    "Alito talks a lot about history, [that] its so important whether this is a right thats been recognized through history.",
    "I think it would be easier for the court to do that if there was a little bit of a change in blood at the bench there.",
    "No matter how many people in the country support it, couldnt that turn out to jeopardize the rights of LGBTQ people?",
    "But chief justice being first among equals, he doesnt really have any outright power to affect the decision.",
    "Abortion rights activist protest outside of the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday, May 3, 2022 in Washington.",
    "So its not lost on the conservatives that he has, in their view, been unfaithful to their cause.",
    "To see that in real time is kind of a unique access to the process that we havent seen before.",
    "Many of those cases continue to resound in other disputes that keep coming before the court.",
    "Transcribed excerpts from that conversation are below, edited for length and readability.",
    "When you look at those things, thats a right that would seem on paper to be in jeopardy.",
    "Try to keep it on a high plane, please.? Do you think they will keep it on a high plane?",
    "The experts Ive talked to say that arguably it is undermining the notion of Obergefell.",
    "I think it is likely to harden the established positions of the justices on this.",
    "Donald Trump got three appointments to the Supreme Court and times have changed.",
    "Canellos: What are you anticipating in terms of the liberal justices dissent?",
    "Canellos: A lot of people are concerned about gay rights and gay marriage.",
    "Is Roberts now sort of a lonely man on his own court on an island of one?",
    "And I think the answer is, as far as I can tell, not not at the moment.",
    "That was something that was criminalized well into the 20th century.",
    "I doubt that the appetite is present for these justices to do that.",
    "Its the justices whose votes might potentially have been in play.",
    "But I dont think theres a huge movement to try to overturn it.",
    "Well, who said that it might apply to a bunch of other things?",
    "Maybe he makes some effort to try to assign it a certain way.",
    "I think his task became much more difficult on Monday night.",
    "No one can be sure what will follow and where it will lead.",
    "I doubt that the whole thing has completely broken down.",
    "So clearly, theres no lengthy history through America.",
    "The question really is, is it in reality in jeopardy?",
    "Is that next on the agenda for the conservative bloc?",
    "You can imagine two themes that they might explore.",
    "I would predict that well have several dissents.",
    "Yes, the liberals are tending to vote together.",
    "Maybe the truth lies somewhat in the middle.",
    "Gerstein: Not all of them, I dont think so.",
    "Some of them are like 3-3-3 decisions.",
    "And so Im hearing dueling arguments.",
    "Perhaps in some conservative states.",
    "Gerstein: I think it could happen.",
    "Gerstein: I think its hard to say.",
    "Remember, its not just Obamacare.",
    "Do you think theyll go that far?",
    "Is that Roberts position?",
    "The ship has sailed."
