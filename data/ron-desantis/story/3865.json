    "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, yes, and I think that -- I think one of the things that's missing, and I'm glad that you're bringing this up, in all of the conversation, the media coverage about Roe vs. Wade being overturned, is that what this does -- it's not an all-out federal ban on abortion, but it puts it back into state legislators and into Congress.",
    "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: What is really interesting, Margaret, about this is, for decades, I have been trying to say to my Republican friends and women who care about a woman's right to choose, who contribute to Planned Parenthood and all of those organizations, you can't do that and expect -- you've got to weigh in with your own party on this.",
    "And the ball is in the court of those justices, one of whom at least said over and over again that precedent -- that precedence has been established again and again on Roe v. Wade and that -- so, this decision is about being anti-precedent and anti- privacy, and has serious ramifications as we go -- as we go down this path.",
    "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, that -- that bill has already been signed into law, the fetal heartbeat bill for South Carolina that he signed, I guess it was last year, had a -- it was -- it was six to eight weeks is when the heartbeat is found, but that bill had exceptions for rape and incest and life of the mother.",
    "We have been fighting against the Republicans in the Congress constantly because the fact is, they're anti -- not just anti a woman's right to choose in terms of terminating a pregnancy, but in terms of access to contraception and family planning and the rest, both domestically and globally.",
    "ED O'KEEFE: And in Florida, which also gained a House seat, Republican governor Ron DeSantis insisted state lawmakers draw a map that eliminated an historically black congressional district, stretching from Jacksonville to Tallahassee, potentially giving Republicans four more seats.",
    "And what I talk about in the book is to say, look, we should term limit the justices, 18 years, and that every president should have an opportunity to nominate two justices per term and to try to take some of the pressure out of this -- the partisanship and the confirmation process.",
    "So products and systems like F-16, F-35, patriot missiles, THAAD missiles, we know that there's going to be increased demand for those kinds of equipment, too, because the threat between Russia and China is just going to increase even after the Ukrainian war, we hope is over soon.",
    "And I think we should -- what I've tried to put out -- point out in the book is that we have faced these issues before and that we've had heroes and heroines in our history that have faced similar kinds of issues and through sacrifice, commitment, they have made a difference.",
    "So, we are calling on everyone to do everything possible and impossible to get our wounded soldiers, to get our heroes, to create all possible corridors in order to get our people still out from Azovstal, where they bravely defend the Ukrainian flag and Ukraine in Mariupol.",
    "And this week on Face the Nation: The future of a woman's right to choose an abortion is in jeopardy in many states across the country, as an unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade creates the political equivalent of an earthquake.",
    "The suit that we won in Alabama was -- where we said that you should have additional representation for a black -- the black inhabitants of Alabama, those districts were certainly drawn with the thought that they would disenfranchise African-Americans in Alabama.",
    "And, yes, we've brought a lot of lawsuits -- successfully brought a lot of lawsuits in order to make sure that the process is done in a fair way and so that the American people actually pick their representatives as opposed to politicians choosing their voters.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Alabama because as I understand it, the Supreme Court has tried not to directly get involved in what they deemed political gerrymandering, but they have signaled a willingness to hear cases that involve issues of race.",
    "But back when Democrats held majorities in the House and the Senate, 2009, when you were speaker, President Obama was asked about codifying Roe versus Wade and said abortion is a moral and ethical issue and -- quote -- \"not the highest legislative priority.\"",
    "At the state level, do you actually think the South Carolina legislature is in tune with public opinion here because, I mean, our polling shows more than two-thirds of Republicans say abortion should be generally available or available with stricter limits.",
    "You know, in the book you write both parties have embraced gerrymandering when they were in control of state governments, but you say Democrats were caught asleep at the wheel when Republicans started investing 12 years ago in some of these local races.",
    "And so our production line can run today, but in the future we're going to need more domestic capability in microprocessor, not only design, but manufacturing, testing, et cetera, so that were have assured supply of those microprocessors in the future.",
    "In Mariupol, government officials say, while all women, children and the elderly have finally escaped from the besieged steel plant, as many as 2,000 Ukrainian forces remain, some medics, some badly wounded, some still fighting to the end.",
    "It has been a turbulent week across the country, as one of the most esteemed institutions in our government, the Supreme Court, experienced something that happens all the time here in Washington, the leak of a document to the media.",
    "The specificity with which we discuss these matters with the president, president of Ukraine, the connection that we have with the ambassador, whom you will have on the show later, we're very current on the needs and the urgency.",
    "JIM TAICLET: It will be extremely helpful to have the bipartisan innovation act passed, for example, because we do need to invest more in the infrastructure in the U.S. so we have domestic supply, especially in microprocessors.",
    "And although minorities accounted for 95 percent of the state's population growth in the last decade, Republicans redrew the map to protect their incumbents by eliminating competitive districts were Democrats were making gains.",
    "Now, while that is a success, of course, to get the civilians, women and children out, we have to remember that 95 percent of Mariupol is destroyed, that tens of thousand civilians died in Mariupol, were killed by Russians.",
    "ERIC HOLDER: They are -- if you look at Texas, which is getting two additional seats strictly as a result of the increase in the Hispanic population, they have not increased that -- the power of Hispanics in Texas at all.",
    "And when you realize what's happened in your life, the trauma, the emotional, the mental, the physical trauma in a woman's life, that decision -- she should make that decision with her doctor and between her and her God.",
    "(CROSSTALK)\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: If I just may, the focus we have right now is an urgent one in order to try to improve -- and try to improve this, whether we're calling it fake or draft decision, whatever it is.",
    "Well, as we celebrate the 77th also anniversary of the end of the World War II, it's critical that we all do everything possible to stop the war that Russian regime, very much like Nazi regime, started in Europe again.",
    "(Begin VT)\nCHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): Amid the ruins, everywhere evidence of ordinary lives violently interrupted, a woman's shoe, children's toys scattered on the ground, a favorite jacket now hanging from a tree.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: But given the -- given the urgency of with which you're speaking, the Reproductive Choice Act, two pro-abortion rights Republicans in the Senate, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, put that forward.",
    "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, my position on life with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother is in line with my district, it's in line with the majority of, I believe, voters in my state as well.",
    "So, we know there's going to be increased demand for those kinds of systems from the U.S. --\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Throughout -- OK.\nJIM TAICLET: And for our allies as well and beyond into Asia Pacific most likely too.",
    "I think you can't compare, however, what happened in New York and Maryland to what is going on in Texas, Georgia, potentially Florida, Wisconsin, where Republicans have really gone to town in terms of gerrymanders.",
    "And while evacuating civilians, we have to know that so many of our soldiers from Azov steel, from this plant who were trying -- helping civilians to get out have been killed and wounded during these attempts too.",
    "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The Republicans were very clear when they had a presidential campaign that their campaign was to elect a president who would appoint judges who would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade.",
    "And here's my prediction, at some point people at the Justice Department, perhaps that prosecutor in Atlanta, are going to have to make a determination about whether or not they want to indict Donald Trump.",
    "CBS News has learned that the Biden administration is sending a small group of American diplomats, including the acting ambassador to the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, to counter Russia's Victory Day celebrations.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is some speculation that Putin could officially acknowledge the country is at war and then start conscripting soldiers, which would help him build up that offensive in the east.",
    "New York lost one House seat in the census, and although Republicans currently hold eight House seats, the new map drawn by Democrats would have make it difficult for Republicans to win more than four.",
    "My Republican colleagues have said to me on occasion, we're not for any family planning domestically or globally, because I was trying to get them to support us on some global family planning issues.",
    "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA director said yesterday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is doubling down on his invasion of Ukraine and does not believe that he can afford to lose.",
    "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We now turn to Jim Taiclet, the CEO of defense giant Lockheed Martin, which makes some of the weapons the U.S. is sending to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.",
    "VANITA GUPTA, ASSOCIATE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Texas' redistricting plans will dilute the increased minority voting strength that should have developed from these significant demographic shifts.",
    "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And it was even Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who we all know was a -- was working for women's right and thought there was a constitutional right for women to have an abortion.",
    "ERIC HOLDER: Well, I think we certainly stopped the Republicans when they said they wanted to secure a decade of power in this next decade based on the redistricting that they were going to do.",
    "(BEGIN VT)\nED O'KEEFE (voice over): In four big states this year, two red and two blue, Democrats and Republicans couldn't agree on a redistricting plan, so courts were asked to intervene.",
    "ED O'KEEFE (on camera): When the dust settles after this decades round of redistricting, it remains to see whether either party will emerge with a distinct structural advantage nationwide.",
    "REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So, this is a political decision on the part of this...\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The rule of law in our country should be respected.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. said a few days ago that Russia is planning sham elections and they're going to try to annex parts of your country, Donetsk, Luhansk in the east, also Kherson.",
    "JIM TAICLET: We're planning for the long run, and not just in the javelin, because this situation, the Ukrainian conflict, has highlighted a couple of really important things for us.",
    "We traveled to the battered village of Velyka Novosilka, around 100 miles north of Mariupol, where 10 Russian battalion groups, around 10,000 troops, have already been redeployed.",
    "So the president will raise everything that we have been discussing during the past -- this past 73 days, more military support, more sanctions, more financial support to Ukraine.",
    "Not only does it draw into question the sanctity of the court, but, if the draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito holds, Roe vs. Wade may be overturned early this summer.",
    "The governor of South Carolina, your home state, fellow Republican, said if Roe v. Wade is overturned, he wants further restrictions without those exceptions of rape or incest.",
    "I - - from experience as a state lawmaker, I know that South Carolina's fetal heartbeat bill would not have passed without exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.",
    "The map that you see in New York reflects really a population shift, a hollowing out of the rural areas in New York, as well as an increase in the urban areas in New York.",
    "But that's one of the things I talk about in my book, this notion of us getting to some structural changes, that we need to look -- we need to ban partisan gerrymandering.",

    "There is turmoil around the nation, as Republicans and Democrats scramble to figure out what the political and the practical impact of new abortion restrictions could be.",
    "Unrepresentative Senate, unnecessary anti- democrat Electoral College, gerrymandered House of Representatives, panoply of state legislatures, and a stolen Supreme Court.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: The things you think might be next, do you need to legislate to enshrine those in law right now to protect them, if you think the court may overturn?",
    "And so, as -- I now it's part of the Republican Party platform, the vast majority of Republicans support those exceptions for rape, and incest, and life of the mother.",
