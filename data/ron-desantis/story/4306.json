    "DeSantis and many other Florida Republicans should remember that Florida still has nearly 4 million independent voters, so even with that 32,000-vote margin that won him the office in the first place, the governors got a long way to go to be certain he can still get the majority he needs.",
    "His national profile grows every day as the darling of Fox News, the network that perhaps finally realizes that the bloviating coming from Mar-A-Lago may be wearing out its welcome and someone with an actual education and political experience can be their new golden boy.",
    "Alex Jimenez Winter Park\nBring Reedy Creek debt full-circle\nIf the Reedy Creek Improvement District is dissolved, and local taxpayers refuse to pay its outstanding debt, what about sending the bill to Mexico, like Donald Trump said we could with his border wall?",
    "Shane Fischer Ocoee\nDeSantis defeat could be Disney happy ending\nIt looks like we Orange County citizens will get a raw deal on the dissolution of Reedy Creek, no matter how it goes.",
    "The law dissolving Reedy Creek does not go into effect until June 1, 2023, so there is one sure way to solve this problem without any additional cost to Orange County.",
    "At worst, they will cost taxpayers a lot of E-tickets in attorney fees and possibly, a hefty tax bill to the residents of Orange and Osceola counties.",
    "They are mutually exclusive because a traditional conservative would not align themselves with the cesspool that the Republican party has become.",
    "Gov.Ron DeSantis has been on a rampage, ramming through a barrage of legislation on culture war issues that are nothing more than buzzwords.",
    "If they allow Florida to go through with the dissolution of Reedy Creek, we have a headache and a lot of extra infrastructure to maintain.",
    "Mexico could pay with their credit card, earn enough airline miles to qualify for a free flight to Orlando, and thus visit Disney.",
    "Disney has stood by quietly, knowing full well that the performative politics of his actions against them are at best, illegal.",
    "Then DeSantis chose to pick a fight with Disney, one that may have earned him some campaign donations and even more attention.",
    "Republicans have the ability to look away at whatever insanity is propagated amongst their far-right flank.",
    "Perhaps the Democrats running for office will adopt a platform of returning Reedy Creek to Disney.",
    "Another happy Disney ending for the most magical place on Earth.?\nKathy Toerner Kennedy Orlando",
    "And every time there is a pothole in a Disney road, there will be the devil to pay.",
    "DeSantis shouldnt alienate GOP centrists\nWe have Conservatives and Republicans.",
    "If Disney ends up taking it to court, we pay legal fees.",
    "We simply vote DeSantis out of the Governors Mansion.",
    "But this one could very well backfire on him.",
    "Any Democrat will do at this point.",
    "Also vote the GOP Legislature out.",
    "It all comes full circle!",
    "Problem solved."
