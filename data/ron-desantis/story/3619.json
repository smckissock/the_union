    "Florida is probably best characterized as a fragile state.? According to the World Bank, fragile statehood exists in situations where there is low level of government performance, where state institutions are weak or on the verge of collapse and where the state either fails to perform core roles or performs them wholly inadequately.?\nThat Florida is probably best described as a fragile state? tells us that the word democracy? as a description of America is covering up for the fact that Florida is probably best described as a fragile state.?\nThe people of Florida think they live in a democracy, because their state is one of the United States, which everyone says is a democracy.",
    "A democracy in that the people of Florida do cast votes, but the power of their vote is mitigated by the relative strength of the whole electorate, which is to say, the health and well-being of a people previously undermined, or even sabotaged, by the states ruling elite.",
    "As a result, those who govern are closer to a ruling elite indifferent to the peoples suffering on account of the people, as long as they suffer, cannot and therefore do not mount resistance to the ruling elite.",
    "The health and well-being of the people is important, or should be, to those whom the people have chosen to govern, because those who govern are accountable to the people, the ultimate political sovereign.",

    "Here in Connecticut, where democracy is habitual and the common good cultural, those who govern successfully slowed the spread of the covid, though that meant shutting down the economy.",
    "In Florida, by contrast, those who govern behaved less consensually and more imperiously  similar to the ruling elites in countries like Syria.",
    "That the United States is not one country tells us that democracy? as a description of our form of government is doing a helluva lot of work.",
    "That democracy? as a description of our country isnt quite right tells us the language of international relations might be more appropriate.",
    "But a democracy leaving its people alone to face death by the covid is a democracy straining very the meaning of the word.",
    "The thinking that animates public health is far more than the health and welfare of the citizens who constitute a society.",
    "Deaths by the covid rose and fell, rose and fell, in proportion to the strength and weakness of the coronavirus.",
    "In a country like, say, Syria, the health of the polity is of little or no consequence to the ruling class.",
    "If people are sick, if people die, well, that has nothing to do with maintaining the elites grip on power.",
    "If those who govern fail to stem the spread of deadly infectious disease, they have failed politically.",
    "We cant let the week go without mentioning the 1 million Americans killed by the covid since 2020.",
    "The thinking that animates public health is by necessity rooted in political thought.",
    "I think its to reassess how we understand the role of public health in a republic.",
    "Governor Ned Lamont, whos hardly a saint, behaved as if accountable to the people.",
    "Conversely, a people sick and dying cannot and therefore do not rule themselves.",
