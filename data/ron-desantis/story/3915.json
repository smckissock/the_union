    "With good reason, we called it the worst environmental bill in state history.?\nThe bill would essentially have forced the South Florida Water Management District, the lead state agency on Everglades restoration, to make Lake Okeechobee a private reservoir for farmers in the Everglades Agricultural Area.",
    "The bill attempted to undercut new policies that take effect in January and treat the lake as the key regional environmental resource that it is.",
    "The version that the Legislature finally passed is better than the original, but it remains unneeded and potentially problematic.",
    "Two bills that threaten the Everglades have not yet gone to Gov.",
    "To review, SB 2508 emerged halfway through the session.",
    "Farmers and their allies oppose those policies.",
    "When they do, he should veto both.",
    "The first is Senate Bill 2508.",
    "Ron DeSantis."
