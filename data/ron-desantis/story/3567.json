Wendy Rogers and white nationalist Nick Fuentes.",
    "Since the shooting, many on the right have either doubled down on their promotion of such paranoia, downplayed the massacre by pointing to other crimes or misleadingly suggested that the shooter, whose gun was reportedly emblazoned with the word \"N***er,\" was actually motivated by left-wing ideology.",
    "\"He literally writes that he's an anti-Semitic, anti-Christian Nazi leftist but the same ghoulish grifters who always rush to exploit tragedy for political points somehow glossed over this,\" echoed far-right radio host and former spokesperson for the National Rifle Association Dana Loesch.",
    "Gendron's apparent belief in the theory was first reported after outlets obtained the shooter's 180-page manifesto, written before the shooting took place, that contains explicit references to the \"great replacement\" in addition to a medley of hateful and racist rants.",
