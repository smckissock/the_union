    "The three-judge appeals court panel, all of whom were appointed by President Donald Trump, noted a Supreme Court ruling that said \"the good faith of the state legislature must be presumed\" in cases involving statutes that may be \"tainted by discriminatory intent.\"",
    "\"They have done so not as, in the words of Dr. King, 'vicious racists, with [the] governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification,' but as part of a cynical effort to suppress turnout among their opponents supporters.\"",

    "For instance, the court imputed discriminatory intent to SB90 based in part on one legislators observation,\" the panel wrote.",
    "\"The reviewing court must be cognizant that 'orders affecting elections ... can themselves result in voter confusion.'",
