    "Later in March, Moricz joined a group of students, parents, educators and advocates in a federal lawsuit for the law, saying it would stigmatize, silence, and erase LGBTQ people in Floridas public schools.?\nThe reason something like the Dont Say Gay law seems like nothing but is actually everything is that when you cannot talk about or share who you are, there is a constant subconscious affirmation that you are not valid, that you should not exist,? Moricz said.",
    "It's unclear if the school would extend the same requirement for a student speaking about their faith, their race, their personal family situation, whether their parents were immigrants, or any other experience that could be deemed \"political.\"",
    "\"Out of respect for all those attending the graduation, students are reminded that a graduation should not be a platform for personal political statements, especially those likely to disrupt the ceremony,\" the district said.",
