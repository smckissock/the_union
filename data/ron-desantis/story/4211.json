    "Some Twitter users appeared upset over the criticism, including liberal Axios reporter Chelsea Cirruzzo, who complained that people were upset over DCist's \"inclusive language.\"",
    "\"Really really telling who is upset that the headline uses inclusive language than the actual content of the story which is very very alarming,\" she wrote.",
