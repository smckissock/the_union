    "But, she added, the court certainly seems more politicized to me than it used to be, and part of it is because politics have gotten so ugly recently.?\nAs Janna Carney, 35, picked up lunch near the downtown Los Angeles office where she works as a creative director in advertising, she said, I liked the idea they couldnt be owned by anybody, because you cant vote for them, theyre not running campaigns.?
