    "The Republican consultant Brad Todd told me he believes a Roe reversal mostly will drive up Democratic margins in places where they already have margins and increase Republican intensity in places where we already have intensity.? But he sees one segment of the electorate as up for grabs?: mothers who describe themselves as somewhat pro-choice,? a group of voters whom he says want some state restrictions on abortion rights but are supportive of legal access in very early pregnancy.?\nEven small shifts could have big consequences in Novembers Senate and gubernatorial races in purple states such as Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada; across the Sunbelt; and in the perennial Rust Belt battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.",
    "But, she added, there is a question of how much any of that matters if what the Supreme Court is interested in doing is becoming a political actor.?\nTo Robert P. Jones, the CEO of PRRI, moves by both red states and the GOP-appointed justices, including a potential Roe overturn and an array of decisions in favor of religious liberty,? represent a last stand? effort to inscribe a white conservative Christian worldview? into the nations laws while we are still on the bubble of demographic change.? White Christianslong the American majoritynow make up less than 45 percent of the total U.S. population and only about one-third of the population younger than 50.",
    "Tony Perkins, the longtime president of the Family Research Council, the evangelical activist group, nodded to that tradition after the Roe leak when he urged the groups members to pray for Alitos decision to stand, writing, May this be the dawn of a day we all prayed forwhere all human life is welcomed into our arms and cherished in our laws.?\nAs the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority flexes its power, it will continue to find itself at odds with the priorities of Americas kaleidoscopically diverse generations born since 1980.",
    "The fundamental divide in our politics today is between those voters and places most comfortable with the demographic and cultural changes remaking 21st-century America and those most hostile to themwhat Ive called the Democratic coalition of transformation? and the Republican coalition of restoration.? A decision overturning Roe v. Wadeespecially on the sweeping grounds in Justice Samuel Alitos draft opinion that was leaked to Politicowould sharpen the confrontation between these two coalitions.",
    "When you have stuff like this [potential ruling] happening, I think this is solidifying this dimension of conflict well into the future.?\nDemocrats, who have won the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections, have a larger coalition in this political conflict, but one that is still often stymied by its own lack of competitiveness outside large metropolitan areas and the bias in both the Senate and the Electoral College toward small states dominated by the GOPs coalition.",
    "Those who want to ban abortion are far less likely than those who support its legal status to believe that the United States would be better off? if more women held political office; to express positive views toward the #MeToo movement; or to agree that systems in society were set up to give men more opportunities than women.? Most anti-abortion women agree with those propositions as well.",
    "In one revealing measure of that divide, PRRI results over the past two years show that while the Democratic electorate can now divide roughly in thirds among white Christians, nonwhite Christians, and secular adults, white Christians still account for about seven in 10 Republicansa level last seen in American society overall in the early 1990s.",
    "Tresa Undem, a pollster mostly for progressive organizations who studies attitudes toward abortion and gender roles, agrees on that point, but she says a decision overturning Roe as flatly as the Alito draft does could both inspire more turnout among Democrats in November and push women who identify as political independents away from the GOP.",

    "Alitos draft, if finalized, would place the GOP-appointed Supreme Court majority firmly on a collision course with the priorities and preferences of the racially and culturally diverse younger generations born since 1980, who now constitute a majority of all Americans and who overwhelmingly support abortion rights.",
    "What is less talked about is that beliefs about abortion are very linked to your beliefs about women and gender and power.?\nIn Undems polling, Americans who want to make abortion illegal in all or most cases consistently express much more skepticism than abortion-rights supporters about changing gender roles.",
    "Cathryn Oakley, the senior counsel and state legislative director at the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, says a Roe reversal wouldnt necessarily undermine the legal reasoning behind the Courts landmark rulings upholding rights for that communitybut that it hardly guarantees their security.",
    "And we are not going to quit and give up on these issues without a righteous fight.?\nMaybe the clearest message of Alitos draft opinion is that the conservative Supreme Court majority is determined to give Ramirez, and the generations she embodies, exactly that kind of fight for years to come.",
    "Red states are passing a torrent of socially conservative laws restricting not just abortion rights but voting rights and LGBTQ rights; limiting how teachers discuss race, gender, and sexual orientation in schools; banning books; and strengthening penalties for public protest.",

    "That last shift, which President Donald Trump hastened with his overt appeals to the racial and social grievances of the most culturally conservative white Americans, has fueled the increasing volatility and belligerence of modern politicsand it only stands to intensify.",

    "Underneath all of this,? Jones says, is an assumption of a kind of ownership of American culture [as a] white Christian America.?\nThe anti-abortion movement has long been divided on how to respond to such allegations.",

    "One branch focuses on the argument that Roe granted Americans a new right not enumerated in the Constitution and usurped decisions that properly belonged to elected bodies.",
    "In a 2019 Georgia poll, a plurality opposed the Republican-passed six-week abortion ban that has been blocked by the courts but that would be allowed by the Alito opinion.",
