    "\"For example, throwing out stare decisis the foundation respecting precedent is a foundation of Supreme Court jurisprudence.\"",
    "\"The cancer of Trump's influence has fully spread to the body politic to reach the judicial branch,\" he added.",
    "\"The opinion is full of distortions of the law and the facts,\" Eisen told Newsweek from Los Angeles.",
