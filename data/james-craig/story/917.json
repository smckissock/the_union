Whitmer said.",

    "And that's why it's important right now, with this Michigan Constitution, to get an interpretation from the court that determines that, in fact, it does recognize women's right to privacy under due process and the ability to make our own decisions about our bodies.?\nWhitmer is up for reelection in November.",
