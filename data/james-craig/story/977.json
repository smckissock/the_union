    "Gibbons, who badly lost the 2018 primary for Ohio's other Senate seat, also has dropped a Cygnal poll giving him a wider 23-11 edge over Mandel, which is a huge improvement from the 16-13 edge the firm gave him two weeks ago,\nVance's allies at Protect Ohio Values, meanwhile, are going up with their first TV spot since mid-November, a move that come days after Politico reported that the Peter Thiel-funded group's own polls showed that \"Vance needs a course correction ASAP that will resolidify him as a true conservative.\"",
    "That earlier survey of the current field had Brnovich leading McGuire 25-11; when Ducey was added, he beat the attorney general 27-12.\n? OH-Sen: The Republican firm co/efficient has released the very first survey of the May primary that wasn't done on behalf of a candidate or allied group, and it shows businessman Mike Gibbons leading former state Treasurer Josh Mandel 20-18, with state Sen. Matt Dolan in third with 7%; former state party chair Jane Timken takes 6%, while venture capitalist J.D.",
    "Opt in to email updates from Daily Kos Elections\nSponsored by: Daily Kos Elections\nAmodei quickly responded by protesting, \"In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment,\" though even expressing openness to an inquiry was enough to infuriate not only the rank-and-file but top Republicans as well.",
    "Kean will likely have another line before long: The New Jersey Globe writes that he recently received the unanimous support of the Republican Executive Committee in Warren County, which forms another 14% of the 7th District, meaning \"he is the favorite to win the county organizational line there as well.\"",
    "The incumbent, though, enjoyed a huge fundraising lead over Fung, and she and her allies worked to tie him to the toxic Trump administrationa task the mayor made pretty easy the previous year when he posted a picture on Facebook of him at Trump's inauguration smiling and wearing a Trump wool cap.",

    "Leading Off\n? NV-02: Douglas County Commissioner Danny Tarkanian, a Republican who finally ended his legendary losing streak last cycle, revealed to the Nevada Independent that he's considering challenging Rep. Mark Amodei in the June primary for Nevada's 2nd Congressional District.",
    "One favorable development for Taylor since then, though, is the fact that the 2nd became a couple of points redder in redistricting: Under the old lines, it voted for Joe Biden by a 51-47 margin, but the new version would have supported Biden by a slightly narrower 50-48 spread.",
    "Taylor, though, would have to contend with a few candidates who are already seeking the Republican nomination, including state Sen. Jen Kiggans and high school football coach Jarome Bell, both of whom are also Navy vets (Virginia Beach is home to a huge Naval air station).",
    "Sen. Robert Menendez and 2nd Congressional District candidate Jeff Van Drew, who was still a year away from his infamous party switch, appeared in the column identified as \"BURLINGTON COUNTY REGULAR DEMOCRATS,\" along with party-backed candidates running for other offices.",
    "Fung went ahead with a long-awaited campaign for governor during the 2014 red wave, and while he lost to Raimondo 41-36 (a hefty 21% went to the late Robert Healey of the Moderate, or \"Cool Moose,\" Party), he remained the state GOP's biggest name following his near miss.",
    "Things got worse for him when national Republicans began canceling their TV ads weeks ahead of Election Day, while Fung himself had to run commercials warning that conservative independent Joe Trillo's presence on the ballot would make Raimondo's re-election more likely.",
    "Governors\n? LA-Gov: Republican state Rep. Daryl Deshotel attracted lots of local attention when he recently gave his own campaign $1 million, and he told the Lafayette Daily Advertiser on Thursday, \"I'm open to everything, but I honestly don't have a target right now.\"",
    "The challenger joined a pro-development slate of candidates seeking seats on the five-member body, and this time, fortune was, at last, just barely on his side: Tarkanian won the nomination 50.1-49.9a margin of 17 votesand he had no opposition in the general election.",
    "Fung was decisively elected to lead Rhode Island's second-most populous city in 2008 on his second try, an accomplishment that made him the state's first Chinese American mayor, and he quickly emerged as a Republican rising star in the heavily Democratic Ocean State.",
    "She goes on to say she \"used to like Henry Cuellar,\" the congressman Cisneros is hoping to unseat in the March 1 primary, but criticizes him for \"taking money from big insurance and drug companies\" even as the cost of medication and insurance has risen for her.",

    "Redistricting\n? LA Redistricting: Louisiana's GOP-run state House has passed a new congressional map with two independents joining all 68 Republicans to total 70 votes in favorexactly the number that would be needed to override a veto by Democratic Gov.",

    "House\n? CA-03: Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones received an endorsement from Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who represents an inland San Diego County seat, for the June top-two primary for this open district in Sacramento's eastern suburbs.",
    "? MI-Gov: Blueprint Polling, which describes itself as a \"sister company\" to the Democratic firm Chism Strategies, is out with a survey showing Democratic incumbent Gretchen Whitmer deadlocked 44-44 with former Detroit Police Chief James Craig.",
    "The far-right Club for Growth joined in the fracas by releasing a poll showing former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt beating Amodei in a hypothetical primary, but all of this sound and fury ended up signifying nothingfor 2020 at least.",
    "The left-wing group Justice Democrats is also reportedly spending $78,000 to air a spot on Cisneros' behalf, attacking Cuellar for living it up as a politician (he \"got rides in donors' private jets\" and \"fixed his BMW with campaign cash\").",
    "? VA-02: In an email to supporters that begins with the line, \"I don't know what I'm doing,\" former Republican Rep. Scott Taylor says he's giving \"serious consideration\" to yet another comeback bid in Virginia's 2nd Congressional District.",
    "While Issa's constituency is located hundreds of miles to the south of the new 3rd District, he may have some clout with conservatives more broadly thanks in part to his long history of using his influence in Congress to torment Democrats.",
    "In 2016, he easily won election over Democrat Shaun Brown following an unusual series of events that began when a federal court threw out much of Virginia's congressional map for illegally diminishing the political power of Black voters.",
    "After the court drew new lines, GOP Rep. Scott Rigell announced his retirement, which prompted another Republican congressman, Randy Forbes, to say he'd seek re-election in Rigell's district, since his own had been made unwinnably blue.",
    "? TX-30: Web3 Forward, a new super PAC with ties to the crypto industry, is out with its first TV spot in support of state Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and the group says it will spend $1 million to aid her in the March 1 Democratic primary.",
    "In September of 2019, Amodei pissed off conservatives nationwide when he became the first House Republican to identify as impeachment-curious, saying of the inquiry into Trump, \"Let's put it through the process and see what happens.\"",
    "However, as South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace just learned the hard way, Trump is very happy to back primary challenges to members who dared blamed him for the attack on the Capitol even if they sided with him on the impeachment vote.",
    "But in the end, Taylor was likely done in by his own hand: His own staffers conspired to put Brown on the ballot as an independent in order to siphon votes from Luria, but they were busted for forging signatures on her petitions.",
    "Two years later, however, Taylor ran headlong into the blue wave, as shifting demographics in the Virginia Beach area plus a far stronger Democratic opponent in Navy veteran Elaine Luria combined to give him a difficult race.",
    "? NY-Gov: Westchester County Executive George Latimer, who previously backed Attorney General Tish James during her abortive six-week campaign for governor, has now thrown his support behind Democratic incumbent Kathy Hochul.",
    "? PA-18: Nonprofit executive Stephanie Fox, a Democrat who didn't report any fourth quarter fundraising with the FEC, has announced that she'll run for a state House seat rather than continue with her congressional bid.",
    "The commercial seeks to do that with clips of the candidate attacking \"elites\" and concludes with footage of Fox host Tucker Carlson telling him, \"You've really, I think, understand what's gone wrong with the country.\"",
    "The spot concludes with the voiceover saying, \"We need someone who works for us\" and shows a photo of Cisneros along with her name on screen, but for no clear reason, the narrator doesn't actually say her name aloud.",

    "Lisa McCormick, who was challenging Menendez for renomination, was listed on her own in the second column while the three candidates running against Van Drew each had a column entirely to themselves.",
    "However, the plan differs somewhat from the map that the state Senate approved a few days earlier (also with a two-thirds supermajority), so the two chambers will have to iron out their differences.",

    "Kiggans raised $251,000 in the fourth quarter and had $342,000 on hand, while Bell, who finished third in the primary last cycle, brought in $112,000 but finished with just $121,000 in the bank.",
    "That's because, in many counties, endorsed candidates appear in a separate column on the ballot along with other party endorsees, a big deal in a state where party machines are still powerful.",
    "That result might have cost Team Red the swingy 3rd District, but only just: Tarkanian lost to his Democratic foe, now-Sen. Jacky Rosen, 47-46 as Donald Trump was carrying the district 48-47.",
    "Taylor disavowed all knowledge, but an investigation into the scandal (which resulted in multiple aides getting indicted) consumed his campaign and was the focus of countless Democratic ads.",
    "Notably in 2016, Tarkanian overcame $1.6 million in outside spending directed against him in the GOP primary to defeat state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson, the choice of then-Gov.",
    "The congressman, though, this time used his interview to say upfront that he'd oppose an impeachment inquiry, and he soon joined most of his party colleagues in voting against impeachment.",
    "Blueprint, which says it did this survey \"with no input or funding from any candidate, committee or interest group,\" did not release numbers testing Whitmer against any other Republican.",
    "Amodei joined the rest of the GOP caucus in voting against both the inquiry and Trump's first impeachment, and neither Laxalt nor anyone else of stature ended up running against him.",
    "While it remains to be seen what argument Tarkanian might put forward to persuade primary voters to oust Amodei, the congressman's experience last cycle could preview what's to come.",
    "The opening ad praises Crockett for leading \"the fight to stop voter suppression efforts in Texas\" and reminds the audience that she's backed by retiring Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson.",
    "The Trump campaign soon rolled out its state co-chairs for 2020, and politicos noticed that Amodei, who was and remains Nevada's only Republican member of Congress, was snubbed.",
    "Trump, however, managed to redirect Tarkanian just before the filing deadline when he convinced him to drop out and run for the 3rd District a second time, with his endorsement.",

    "? AZ-Sen: The Republican pollster co/efficient, which tells us they have no client, finds no clear favorite in the August GOP primary to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly.",
    "Things played out in a familiar manner right after the Jan. 6 attack when Amodei told Nevada Newsmakers, \"Do I think he [Trump] has a responsibility for what has occurred?",
    "Tarkanian didn't follow through but instead devoted his efforts to denying renomination to an incumbent with a far lower profile, Douglas County Commissioner Dave Nelson.",
    "But Forbes didn't represent any part of the 2nd District, and Taylor, a former Navy SEAL who'd been elected to the state House in 2013, defeated him in the primary 53-41.",
    "But he was hardly done with politics: Amodei himself suggested in April of 2019, months before his impeachment inquiry flirtations, that Tarkanian could run against him.",
    "Tarkanian decided soon afterwards that he'd had enough of Vegas and moved to Douglas County, a small rural community located well to the north, near the Reno area.",

    "? NJ-11: Morris County Surrogate Heather Darling has announced that she'll stay out of the Republican primary to take on Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.",
    "Attorney General Mark Brnovich edges out businessman Jim Lamon 17-13, with Thiel Capital chief operating officer Blake Masters just behind with 12%.",
    "Republicans also took Tarkanian seriously in 2017 when he launched a primary challenge to Sen. Dean Heller and a pair of polls showed him winning.",
    "? IL-03: State Rep. Delia Ramirez has picked up an endorsement from 14th District Rep. Lauren Underwood ahead of the June Democratic primary.",
    "Where it went was a firestorm of far-right outrage, with angry conservatives convinced that Amodei had actually called for impeaching Trump.",
    "Edwards has indicated he would veto a map that does not create a second Black district, which neither the House or Senate proposals do.",
    "While the national political climate very much favored Democrats, Raimondo had posted unimpressive poll numbers throughout her tenure.",
    "He joins a September primary that includes state Sen. Jessica de la Cruz and 2020 nominee Bob Lancia, who lost to Langevin 58-42.",
    "The governor this time captured the majority that eluded her in 2014 by beating Fung by a decisive 53-37, with Trillo taking 4%.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "Deshotel instead said, \"It may be that I end up using the money to support other candidates who I believe can help the state.\"",

    "(Many Democrats weren't at all sad to see the conservative Mattiello go, since the party easily hung on to its majority.)",
    "Tarkanian, for his part, is also a very familiar name in Silver State politics, though not entirely for welcome reasons.",
    "These numbers are quite a bit different than those another GOP firm, OH Predictive Insights, found a few weeks ago.",
    "Endorsements from county parties are typically very important in New Jersey primaries on both sides of the aisle.",
    "Amodei added, \"I'm a big fan of oversight, so let's let the committees get to work and see where it goes.\"",
    "(A different crypto-aligned PAC, Protect our Future, has also pledged to deploy $1 million for Crockett.)",
    "But Fung, while termed-out as mayor in 2020, was far from finished exerting influence in local politics.",
    "If somebody thinks that they've got a better mousetrap, then those are the avenues available to them.\"",
    "Doug Ducey runs and finds Brnovich narrowly outpacing him 14-13 as Lamon and Masters each take 11%.",
    "You can see an example of this on the 2018 Democratic primary sample ballot from Burlington County.",
    "Tarkanian, though, lost to Democrat Susie Lee by a wide 52-43 spread as Rosen was unseating Heller.",
    "Luria swamped them both, however, with a $672,000 haul and a giant $2.3 million cash stockpile.",
    "Luria wound up unseating Taylor 51-49, then beat him again by a wider 52-46 margin in 2020.",
