    "pic.twitter.com/KnDC2jHXVB\n— Kari Lake for AZ Governor (@KariLake) February 3, 2022\nThat portion of her response is significant because it defends Republican voters who watched the events on election night and can remember the irregularities.",
    "Rather than investigating why swing-state precincts stopped counting nearly in unison, then removed election observers and engaged in other unprecedented behavior, the media nationwide told Americans not to believe their own eyes.",
    "Others fully parroted Democrat talking points and called them racists when they supported laws to roll back the pandemic-related election exceptions like drop boxes, drive-through voting, and widespread mail-in voting.",
    "Thanks to whistleblower testimony, the documentary tracks cellular phone location data and uses dropbox security cameras to confirm allegations of vote harvesting in states where it is illegal.",
    "Ensuring election integrity in the future is incredibly simple if we simply have the political will to do it.” Lake’s proposals to restore confidence are common-sense items with broad support.",
    "We have evidence of corruption in our elections, and they refuse to cover it.”\nThe ABC interview is not the only one where Lake has demonstrated this amount of conviction and poise.",
    "However, if Republican voters can’t trust you to represent their valid concerns about the 2020 election, why should they trust you to represent them in elected office?",

    "There are also court decisions in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ruling that dropboxes and no-excuse mail-in voting violate the respective states’ constitutions.",
    "While Lake’s poise is enviable, her defense of the views of many Republican voters about the 2020 election is something all GOP candidates need to do.",
    "The same survey indicates that 59% of likely voters believe it’s likely that cheating affected the outcome in 2020, and 40% think it is very likely.",
    "No one is required to excuse the behavior of rioters on Jan. 6 to empathize with the doubts that motivated many to attend President Trump’s speech.",
    "Rather than adopting the left’s view of people who still harbor questions about the irregularities they saw, she calmly defended their suspicions.",
    "She suggests robust voter ID, pre-printed paper ballots, removing software from the process, and post-election audits for transparency.",
    "Because the media have turned their back on the people of America and not been honest.”\nThen she called out the media outlets by name.",
    "Her Rumble page is full of interviews with mainstream outlets attempting the same strategy as the ABC reporter that her team records.",
    "Rather than entertain this ridiculous binary, Lake turned the questions back on the reporter and asked what she thought about them.",
    "Republicans do not need to advocate pardoning anyone to articulate the irregularities and influence operations during the election.",
    "Many Americans now have a greater understanding of the private funding of local election offices by Mark Zuckerberg’s foundation.",
    "After making a splash leaving her top-rated anchor position, being a Republican and a MAGA candidate made her a bigger target.",
    "She noted the lack of viewpoint diversity and talked about getting handed content that she viewed as slanted or incomplete.",
    "“The problem is that the American people don’t have all the answers because the media is part of the problem,” Lake began.",
    "The reporter asked Lake if Joe Biden is the current president and if Lake thought that Democrats stole the 2020 election.",

    "Yet supposedly unbiased reporters paint the people with questions about what they saw as conspiracy theorists.",
    "Recently she provided a master class for other Republican candidates on eloquently defending their voters.",
    "After Jan. 6, some commentators likened Americans with concerns about the election to insurrectionists.",
    "When Lake threw her hat into the governor’s race in Arizona, she earned President Trump’s endorsement.",
    "A recent poll shows that 70% of Americans disagree with that type of outside influence on the process.",
    "In a socially distanced interview with ABC, a reporter decided to ask Lake about the 2020 election.",
    "In a two-and-a-half-minute video, Lake articulated her frustration with the journalism profession.",
    "And the media, whose numbers are dropping, dropping like a rock, are going to continue to drop.",
    "They are not reporting on these ballot traffickers that are being paid to drop off ballots.",
    "The people aren’t getting the full story.”\nWATCH: The Media just won’t learn their lesson.",
    "That doesn’t stop her from engaging with the media and forcefully stating her positions.",
    "D’Souza claims one individual made 53 trips to 20 separate drop boxes to insert ballots.",
    "Agencies Are Funding Peter Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance Pulling Viruses Out of Animals?",
    "Rasmussen took that poll before Dinesh D’Souza released the trailer for 2,000 Mules.",
    "Many who follow the news feel justified in their suspicions about the 2020 election.",
    "And they did nothing to stop it.” Lake continued, “It was a complete hoax and a lie.",
    "Instead, she described the conflicting views about the 2020 election in clear terms.",
    "I did an interview with @ABC… will they include this portion of it in their piece?",

    "Lake’s campaign website notes that election skepticism is a bipartisan issue.",
    "They continue to try and stump me, but I know their game better than they do.",
    "Using her on-camera skills, Lake came across as unflappable and articulate.",
    "Lake knows how the sausage is made and will not get tripped up easily.",
    "The media has never reported our [Arizona’s] forensic audit fairly.",
    "“In 2016, over 60% of Democrats believed the election was stolen.",
    "In 2020, over 60% of Republicans believe the election was stolen.",
    "“But eventually, I think they will [get the whole story].",
    "Why won’t they just do their job and report the truth?",
    "The media is doing a huge disservice to this country.",
    "Do you think the election was fair?” Lake shot back.",
    "They’re not reporting what is happening in Georgia.",
    "“Do you think Joe Biden garnered 81 million votes?",
    "Lake continued her response to the ABC reporter.",
    "And pretty soon, nobody will be watching.",
    "And now they are doing the opposite.",
