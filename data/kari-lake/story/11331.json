    "— @Anastasia (@mayzeesMom) March 14, 2022\nLake tries to avoid answering question re Jan. 6th Insurrectionists — whether or not she agrees w/ Trump, that “they should be pardoned”, by saying, “This isn’t something a governor does” and yet she immediately proceeds to lecture another country on how it should conduct itself.",
    "Interviewer Liam Bartlett asked Lake, who is endorsed by Donald Trump and currently leading the Republican field in her state, about Trump’s statements that he would pardon the Jan.6 rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol.",

    "— Dr. Jack Brown (@DrGJackBrown) March 14, 2022\nKari Lake….oh my…..a FRAGILE snowflake, who walked out of an Australian interview….without answering ANY questions!",
    "It’s obvious you’ve come into this and you don’t like President Donald Trump.”\n“Kari, do you think they should be pardoned?” Bartlett asked one more time.",
    "That’s just so disrespectful.”\nTrump-endorsed AZ Gov candidate Kari Lake sat down for interview with ‘60 Minutes Australia,’ which aired tonight.",
    "You’re trying to twist that to make me look bad.”\nVisibly ruffled, Lake transitioned into an attack on Australia’s biggest problem — in her mind.",
    "— Morgan Peters (@holladay_joy) March 14, 2022\nCognitive-Emotional Dissonance overloads Kari Lake and she retreats to whataboutism.",
    "— Dr. Jack Brown (@DrGJackBrown) March 14, 2022\nKari Lake thinks Australia would be better much off with more guns?!!",
    "Related: Donald Trump is so damn lazy that he’s not even trying to hide his latest grift\n“Why did you say that, sir?",
    "— paul Siminsky (@PaulSiminsky) March 14, 2022\nHoly shit what I just watched on #60Minutes has completely thrown me.",
    "Things when downhill fast when she was asked if she agreed with Trump that J6 defendants should get pardoned.",
    "Once the connection was cut, but before the cameras stopped rolling, she said: “That guy’s a complete nut.",
    "— JoJofromcocomo (@JJofromcocomo) March 14, 2022\nHer saying Australians have no freedom is beyond insane.",
    "What makes people like her think everyone running around with a gun creates a better society?",
    "In the United States for the same time frame, there were 19,379 gun deaths,not incl suicides.",
    "Someone please explain this to me like I’m a 5th grader, because I really don’t get it.",
    "Her Self-righteousness is another profound signal of Cognitive-Emotional Dissonance.",
    "(@RonFilipkowski) March 14, 2022\n“It’s just the flippant attitude,” Lake continued.",
    "Not enough guns…\n“So we would be better off with more guns here?” Bartlett asked.",
    "This Q wants to be GOVERNOR of AZ…She had a tRumpertantrum and walked off set!",
    "Your man, Donald — your man, Donald, brought it up,” countered Bartlett.",
    "After touting American freedom, Lake quickly wrapped up the interview.",

    "Ignoring the question, Lake said: ““I’m still amazed you said that.",
    "How’s the way she spoke down about Australia and Australians too?!",
    "THIS is not what a TRUE GOVERNOR does…..this “woman” is a coward!",
    "I feel so sorry for the people of Australia,” Lake said.",
    "Do you think they should be pardoned?” Bartlett asked.",
    "Lake appeared to take great offense to his phrasing.",
