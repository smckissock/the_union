    "It was brilliant and if ABC News shows any of this, it will only happen because Lake forced them to do it:\nWill @MarthaRaddatz put some of the substantive portions of the interview in her story?",
    "Kari Lake, who’s running for Arizona Governor, recorded her interview with ABC News today and posted a clip of it on Twitter tonight, a clip she doesn’t think they will show you.",
    "She took that question by the horns and didn’t flinch, turning it back around on the reporter and telling her just how much the American people no longer trust them.",
    "pic.twitter.com/KnDC2jHXVB\n— Kari Lake for AZ Governor (@KariLake) February 3, 2022\nI really don’t know a ton about Kari Lake, but this video makes me want to.",
    "That’s when Lake unloaded a bunch of truth on them:\nWATCH: The Media just won’t learn their lesson.",
    "In the clip the reporter tries to stump Lake, asking if she believes Biden is the president.",

    "— Kari Lake for AZ Governor (@KariLake) February 3, 2022\nLove it!",
    "Why won’t they just do their job and report the truth?",
    "We filmed the whole thing just in case!"
