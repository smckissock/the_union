    "Whether to revive its popularity among disillusioned MAGA voters or because it’s actually furious with Cheney, the RNC’s resolutions committee voted on Thursday to censure Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.",
    "Though the Wyoming GOP censured her for her collaboration with the left, particularly over her voting to impeach Trump, the RNC itself hasn’t done much to reign in the ridiculous RINO.",
    "The vote to censure both was unanimous and was precipitated by the involvement of those two in the January 6th Committee, a leftist ploy to make Republicans look bad.",
    "The RNC sure has taken its time dealing with Liz Cheney, the anti-Trump RINO from Wyoming.",
    "Until now, that is."
