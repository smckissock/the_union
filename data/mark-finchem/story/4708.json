    "Photo: Alamy\nMike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow and a fearless advocate for election integrity, discussed the historic preliminary injunction filed yesterday in Arizona to eliminate digital voting machines during an interview with RSBN’s Brian Glenn.",
    "Lindell further revealed that election integrity advocates will file more preliminary injunctions across the nation to remove the voting machines, including in South Dakota, Alabama, Louisiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, and Ohio.",
    "“We’ve already got forty-some counties gone…and then I believe we’re gonna have the biggest turnout in history for a midterm, ever.”\nIn fact, Lindell says there are plans to do preliminary injunctions in all fifty states.",
    "“Yesterday was [a] historic day in the history of America,” Lindell shared, standing near a line of excited rallygoers in Delaware, Ohio, ahead of Saturday night’s scheduled Save America rally event.",
    "The injunction plaintiffs include Kari Lake, the Republican and Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona governor, and Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Ariz., candidate for Arizona Secretary of State.",
    "The MyPillow CEO says that Trump actually won Ohio in 2020 with 3,400,000 votes, which is an additional 500,000 more votes than what was officially tallied.",
    "Their attorney generals.” He added that only one attorney general in the United States stood up: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.",
    "If successful, the injunction will remove the Dominion voting machines from being used in the upcoming midterm election.",
    "“We filed our first preliminary injunction in the state of Arizona to get rid of the machines once and for all.",
    "“In the 2020 election,” Lindell said, all the stuff that these states did…who was supposed to stop them?",
    "Additionally, Ohio, which President Trump won twice, was not immune to election fraud, Lindell claims.",
    "“What I see happening is the machines are gonna be gone,” Lindell continued.",
    "That’s the first of many, many,” he continued.",
    "“All machines have to go,” he said firmly."
