    "“And I’m not going to go back and kick them in the teeth.”\nThat was enough to earn him a return visit from McCarthy and company, who descended on Bowers’ neighborhood earlier this month to complain that he was “trying to steal our vote.”\nWith Boyer leaving, the Senate needs sanity\nI suppose we should thank the “patriots” given that their efforts convinced Bowers to hold off on retirement.",
    "But I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we violate current law to change the outcome of a certified election.”\nWhile Senate President Karen Fann, R-Prescott, was bowing to Team Trump and the Senate’s kook squad by hiring an unqualified Trump supporter to conduct what she called an “independent” audit of the election, Bowers took a pass.",
    "Bowers will face former Sen. David Farnsworth in an Aug. 2 GOP primary that should tell us a lot about the future of the Republican Party, whether it will remain in the palm of Donald Trump’s hand or revert to the once-Grand Old Party that coalesced around a broad spectrum of conservative principles.",
    "“I’m not going to let them silence at least some type of sanity in the Senate, ‘cause I haven’t seen a lot.”\nWith Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, retiring – you remember, the lone Republican senator who refused to go along with jailing the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors?",
    "Bowers didn't buy that the election was stolen\nThe lifelong Mesa Republican has been a breath of fresh air at the state Capitol in recent years, one of the few GOP leaders who has declined to buy into the collective psychosis that overtook the party after the 2020 election.",
    "More recently, Bowers put the kibosh on Rep. John Fillmore’s proposal to kill the state’s wildly popular early voting program, require a hand count of all ballots within 24 hours and allow the Legislature to overturn the results of any election it doesn’t like.",
    "For that, he was targeted at home\nFor standing on principle, Bowers was targeted for recall by failed U.S. Senate candidate Daniel McCarthy and his Arizona Patriot Party zealots, people who cruised his neighborhood, using a loudspeaker to call him a pedophile.",
    "On Friday, he filed papers to run for the Senate from the new Legislative District 10, a heavily Republican district stretching from Apache Junction west to Val Vista Drive, one that includes Mesa’s Lehi neighborhood.",
    "He’s a rock-ribbed conservative who supported Donald Trump but refused to take a header down the rabbit hole where black is white and up is down and Trump was robbed of re-election, well … because he just was.",
    "A month after the election, it was Bowers who refused to entertain the schemes of the Trump team, along with then-Rep. Kelly Townsend and Rep. Mark Finchem, to overturn the results of the election.",
    "Arizona judge rules that 'law enforcement' is NOT a profession If the Constitution means anything, kick Rep. Gosar off the ballot Does Ducey really think cops in Alaska can help secure our border?",
    "And the Arizona Republican Party, controlled as it is by the far right fanatics, is going to need mainstream leadership if it wants to maintain its grip on a state that’s growing and changing.",
    "It’s worth noting that the fastest growing political force in Arizona are people who shun both parties, those all-important independents who increasingly call the shots in statewide elections.",
    "“For somebody to say we have plenary authority to overthrow a vote of the people for something we think may have happened, where is it?” Bowers asked Capitol Media Services’ Howard Fischer.",
    "“I don’t know what happened to him, but he needs to retire.”\nWhat happened to him is that he believes conspiracy theories, without hard evidence, are not enough to overturn democracy.",
    "The difference is that Farnsworth believes “100%” that the 2020 election was stolen and that, apparently, is the only qualification that matters.",
    "The term-limited conservative Republican from Mesa has decided not to retire at the end of this term but instead to run for the Arizona Senate.",
    "Both Farnsworth and Bowers are longtime legislators, staunch conservatives and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
    "It’s too soon to say what next year’s state Senate will look like, what with the redistricting that that has scrambled the districts.",
    "“As a conservative Republican, I don’t like the results of the presidential election,” Bowers said in early December 2020.",
    "– the Senate’s going to need a voice of reason there among the Sonny Borrellis and Wendy Rogers’ of the chamber.",
    "Bowers noted the inconvenient fact that the Senate audit produced no evidence of widespread fraud.",
    "Think of it, Bowers there among the various kooks and conspiracy theorists who populate the place.",
    "It remains to be seen whether Republicans in the new LD 10 will maintain their grip on reality.",

    "Support local journalism: Subscribe to azcentral.com today.",
    "Finally, some good news out of the Arizona Legislature.",
    "Can Bowers beat a guy who thinks 2020 was stolen?",
    "“We gave authority to the people ... ,” he said.",
