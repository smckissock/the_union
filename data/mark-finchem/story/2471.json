    "Additionally, Finchem ripped Democrats and the media for routinely dismissing election fraud concerns, saying, “We have debunked the ‘baseless claims’ narrative promoted by the propaganda pushing media and are now on to the business of providing specific relief to the People.”\n“In the case of Maricopa, Pima and Yuma Counties, the fact that there is evidence showing illegal acts occurred, whether by intent or omission does not matter, the margin of error exceeds the margin of victory,” he continued.",
    "“If we are a nation governed by the ‘rule of law,’ as we so often espouse, then violations of the law must have consequences.”\nFinchem argued the 2020 election is “irredeemably compromised,” making it “impossible to name a clear winner of the contest.”\nTrump-endorsed state Sen. Wendy Rogers, R-Ariz., praised the resolution on Twitter, writing, “Honored to cosponsor.",
    "The legislation is based on evidence that suggests the election results of these counties are “irredeemably compromised.”\nAnnouncing HCR 2033, Rep. Finchem called on Maricopa, Pima, and Yuma County to set aside their elections after damning evidence surfaced casting doubts on election integrity.",
    "Great leadership from @RealMarkFinchem.”\nSimilarly, Republican Rep. Andy Biggs revealed in December that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich is working to determine who should be charged with criminal conduct.",
    "“The circumstances surrounding these elections undermine voter confidence in the election system, moreover, they ultimately translate into doubts about election integrity,” Finchem said in a press release.",
    "State Rep. Mark Finchem, R-Ariz., introduced a resolution Monday to “set aside” and decertify the 2020 presidential election in three central Arizona counties.",
    "President Trump proudly endorsed Finchem for Arizona secretary of state."
