    "After Cawthorn filed a injunction in the federal courts, a judge found that the Amnesty Act of 1872, which pardoned confederates, overruled the Constitution’s 14th Amendment prohibiting “insurrectionists” from Congress.",
    "“There at least needs to be a crime, and whether or not disqualification can apply in the absence of conviction for insurrection, it simply cannot apply in the absence of the crime itself,” Kolodin said.",
    "The attorneys also argued that Arizona should have no say in ballot qualifications for federal candidates since the federal government imposes its standards under Article One, Section Five.",
