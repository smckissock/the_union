    "The blurb for the podcast claims Watkins and Teora “aren't afraid to ask politically incorrect questions or investigate what the MSM might want to label as ‘conspiracy theories.’”\nOne person who has known Teora for years, and who spoke to VICE News on the condition of anonymity because they fear backlash for speaking openly, summed him up like this:\n“On a personal level, the man is deeply paranoid and a raging narcissist.",
    "Add the lack of funds to an unorthodox campaigning approach conducted primarily on Telegram, the absence of a much sought-after Trump endorsement, and a campaign manager who “sees UFOs wherever he goes,” and it’s clear that Watkins is facing an uphill climb to make any impact on the Congressional race in Arizona’s second district.",
    "Over the course of the next year, his star within the election truther movement and the wider MAGA community continued to rise, and he was among the first—and loudest—voices promoting the bogus recount that took place over the course of six months in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year.",
    "That project went nowhere–even when Watkins luckily captured a UFO flying over his apartment in Hokkaido, Japan, weeks after the project launched—but the pair have continued to work together on a podcast, initially called Alien Agenda but now called NerveCenter-Pulse of the Nation.",
    "During his two-minute speech, he was told to stop speaking because he was electioneering, but he persisted, shouting over officials to spread a new conspiracy theory that the board members could be removed simply by serving them with some bogus documents.",
    "Watkins said that when he met Finchem, the lawmaker “wasn't so friendly to me” and told Watkins he should step aside because other candidates, like Crane, with whom Finchem has shared a stage at “Stop the Steal” events, are better suited to the role.",
    "Three months later, however, Watkins’ campaign appears dead in the water after his first campaign finance report reveals the former administrator of 8kun, the fringe message board where QAnon flourished, has raised just over $30,000 in donations.",
    "“We really only started fundraising in December—we had a lot of challenges getting funding solutions online, we built two solutions internally,” Teora said, claiming that mainstream platforms had refused to allow Watkins use their services.",
    "A fundraising haul of just $30,000 won’t go very far toward mounting a credible congressional campaign, but Watkins’ campaign manager Tony Teora told VICE News that the reason for the shortfall is a delay in accepting donations.",
    "The podcast began life as a UFO-focused project, but as Watkins’ campaign for Congress began, it switched to a more all-encompassing space to air grievances and conspiracy theories about pretty much all aspects of U.S. society.",
    "When asked about the small sums Watkins’ campaign had raised so far, Teora was bullish, claiming the QAnon influencer would be able to suddenly and radically increase his fundraising power when needed—though he didn’t say how.",
    "Watkins filed his first campaign finance report just before the deadline passed at midnight on Monday, revealing that in the three months to the end of December, he raised just $30,588.22 in small donations from supporters.",
    "Called “Digital Disclosure,” the fundraiser is a $750-a-plate event featuring Watkins in conversation with NSA whistleblower Kirk Weibe at the Ahern Hotel in Las Vegas, the location of a major QAnon conference last October.",

    "It was scary being around him at times, given his volatile temper and bizarre beliefs.”\nIn an email statement responding to these allegations about his beliefs, Teora confirmed the claims made by his acquaintance.",
    "Watkins told VICE News that while at the rally he had tried to speak to Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem, who has promoted QAnon conspiracies, and who is seeking election in November as secretary of state.",
    "By signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.",
    "Despite the fact the recount showed no evidence of widespread voter fraud, Watkins believed he had established enough of a profile to move to the state in early October and declare his intention to run.",
    "Watkins also visited the Trump rally in Florence, Arizona last month, handing out merchandise and glad-handing with the QAnon cult members who believe that John F. Kennedy is about to be resurrected.",
    "Teora, who lived and worked in Japan for years and is also a science fiction author, does have some election experience: In 2014, and again in 2016, he ran for State Assembly in California.",
    "As a result Hamels withdrew from the race, but because the ballots had already been printed, Hamel’s name still appeared and he came in second, with more than twice as many votes as Teora.",
    "The one other major expense Watkins incurred was a $1,000 charge for a booth he rented at the conspiracy-laden ‘Health and Freedom’ conference that took place in Phoenix last month.",

    "“It shows Ron has real support from working class people (voters), not rich lobbyist donors.”\nTeora also said he plans on “ramping up the fundraising” effort.",
    "I am driving up and down the wall looking to see if there is any human trafficking going on,” he said in a video posted to his 400,000 Telegram followers.",
    "Watkins’ opponents had a substantial fundraising lead on him coming into the final three months of 2021, and that has now increased dramatically.",
    "Teora first collaborated with Watkins on the latter’s AlienLeaks project, which was set up as a sort of WikiLeaks for top-secret UFO information.",
