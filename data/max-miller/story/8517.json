    "Calling the decision to retire difficult, Gibbs called it irresponsible “to effectively confirm the congressional map for this election cycle seven days before voting begins.”\nHe appeared to be referencing a March 30 procedural ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court, which extended the briefing schedule for the legal challenge to Ohio's congressional map well past this year's primary.",
    "Gibbs said he believes Ohio's prospects are bright “despite the circus redistricting has become.”\n“These long, drawn-out processes, in which the Ohio Supreme Court can take weeks and months to deliberate while demanding responses and filings from litigants within days, is detrimental to the state and does not serve the people of Ohio,” he said.",
    "Former President Donald Trump weighed in to congratulate Gibbs on “a wonderful and accomplished career.” He called Gibbs a strong ally of his America First agenda and the fight against “the Radical Left.”\n“Thank you for your service, Bob—a job well done!” Trump said in a statement.",

    "The high court's bipartisan majority, comprising Republican Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor and three Democrats, has been engaged in a protracted back-and-forth with the Republican-controlled redistricting commission for months.",
    "That was when Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the state's elections chief, ordered county boards of elections to reflect the Ohio Redistricting Commission's second congressional map on ballots.",
    "COLUMBUS, Ohio — Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs announced his sudden retirement on Wednesday, declaring himself a casualty of “the circus” over Ohio's still-unresolved congressional map.",
    "The six-term congressman from Amish Country exits a primary race in northeast Ohio that, under new temporary maps, would have put him up against Trump-backed Republican Max Miller.",
    "Miller was initially recruited to defeat U.S. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, who joined a handful of fellow Republicans who voted in favor of the former Republican president's impeachment.",
    "Under the temporary congressional maps in Ohio, Gibbs would have faced Trump-backed Republican Max Miller in the GOP primary.",
    "Gibbs is the 17th House Republican to say he won’t seek reelection, compared to 30 Democrats.",
