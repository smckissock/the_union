    "They might argue in this instance, for example, that Carr was deliberately targeting an ethnic minority, the Roma, who have been persecuted, marginalised and finally murdered by the thousands, and within living memory, thanks to the vile ideology of 'racial purity' propounded by the Nazis.",
    "But it was during his recent outing on Netflix, in a comedy special entitled His Dark Material, that Carr — deliberately — pushed the boundaries of his brand too far for many with a joke about the Holocaust and a disparaging remark about the thousands of Gypsies killed by the Nazis.",
    "Boris Johnson's spokesman has weighed in, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries described Carr's comment as 'abhorrent', and Health Secretary Sajid Javid is urging people to send Netflix a 'very strong message' by 'not watching or listening' to Carr.",
    "Back in the 1950s, it banned the music-hall comedian Max Miller and his song Let's Have A Ride On Your Bicycle, due to its 'outrageous' lyrics:\nAfter the ride I began to perspire\nIt wasn't the ride, I'd been pumping her tyre\nInnocent days.",
    "He's like a naughty boy who has deliberately stirred up a hornet's nest — to the delight of the morally indignant and perpetually outraged — and while he may well get stung himself, so too will many others in his wake.",
    "Many of those who identify broadly as 'conservative' feel deep in their bones that freedom of speech and expression are far more important than the right of any individual or group not to have their feelings hurt.",
    "Television bosses will, as a result of his joke, become yet more jittery and anxious, forever checking their Twitter feeds and social media to see if their stars or programmes have caused any offence.",
    "But nowadays, the massed forces of Correctness and Woke — the most censorious and intolerant forces of our time — have some powerful arguments on their side, however much we may dislike that fact.",
    "Arguably even worse was Carr's subsequent back-pedalling, when he tried to make out that his quip might be 'educational', raising awareness that many Roma were killed by the Nazis as well.",
    "On stage in Whitley Bay at the weekend, after he was heckled about the Holocaust issue, he left the audience in no doubt that he had wanted to take on 'cancel culture'.",
    "Nor is the instinct that drives the Censorious Woke, determined to silence anyone who disagrees with them or sees things differently, an entirely new development.",
    "The Traveller Movement, a charity supporting the traveller community in the UK, said the joke in question was 'truly disturbing and goes way beyond humour'.",
    "Comedian Jimmy Carr has always displayed a distinct taste for the tasteless in his stand-up routines and on his hit Channel 4 panel show, 8 Out Of 10 Cats.",
    "The genuinely funny and imaginatively outrageous will have a harder time getting heard as a result, and our cultural experience will be the poorer for it.",
    "Carr said: 'When people talk about the Holocaust, they talk about the tragedy and horror of six million Jewish lives being lost to the Nazi war machine.",
    "Free speech has never been entirely free — and, indeed, a society where absolute free speech was practised would hardly be a society at all, but chaos.",
    "A comedian like Jimmy Carr has to make jokes about one of the most atrocious episodes in human history, the Holocaust, and the sufferings of the Roma.",
    "that this will surely get him cancelled for ever, Carr may well find that it will be the outcome which, in his vanity, he thought he could avoid.",
    "Fellow celebrities have queued up to criticise him, including his friend and fellow comedian David Baddiel and the author Sir Philip Pullman.",
    "But by exploiting the Holocaust for comedy material and then almost begging for attention by prefacing his show with the warning (or boast?)",
    "In wiser moments, the comedian has reflected on how the times we live in remind him of hysterical episodes of book-burning through history.",
    "In the past, he has freely admitted, 'I do a lot of jokes about rape', and previous gags about amputee soldiers have disgusted many.",
    "In the sort of phraseology favoured by the Woke, Jimmy Carr's facile quip risks 'legitimising violence against ethnic minorities'.",
    "'\nHe has a point, but I would argue that what Carr has done is to actively promote cancel culture, to fan the flames feeding it.",
    "It has also launched a petition demanding that the streaming service edit the segment of the show to remove the offending item.",
    "In his defence, Carr has protested that many servicemen loved his performances, and the black humour was typically 'squaddie'.",
    "Nowadays, in order to provoke a storm — and the cynic might say attract attention to a new show — saucy innuendo won't do.",
    "But does it matter if a joke is funny or not, or in such appallingly bad taste that it will offend many reasonable people?",
    "And given that this is the case, no one should have the right to make jokes about something so terrible as genocide.",
    "A joke is just a joke, whether you find it funny or not, and it places no one in danger of physical harm.",
    "Jimmy Carr's joke was irresponsible; a calculated way of provoking and annoying the forces of censorship.",
    "But the truth is rarely simple, and freedom of speech flourishes best when it comes with responsibility.",
    "According to reports, he told them: 'What I am saying on stage this evening is barely acceptable now.",
    "After you've been through a tour of duty in Helmand, you're unlikely to get upset about a mere joke.",
    "It barely deserves repeating, but for the broader points I want to make it is necessary to do so.",
    "His deadpan humour is challenging to say the least, and not something that appeals to everyone.",
    "He even introduced the joke in an arrogant fashion by saying 'it could be a career ender'.",
    "Before Political Correctness, there was Mary Whitehouse and Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells.",
    "You will say: 'I saw a man and he stood on a stage and he made light of serious issues.",
    "'You are going to be able to tell your grandchildren about seeing this show tonight.",
    "Taste aside, the joke that has caused the furore wasn't funny to with start with.",
    "Meanwhile, the BBC has been banning comedians since before many of us were born.",
    "But none of this can come as a surprise for Netflix (market value $175 billion).",
    "No one ever talks about that because no one wants to talk about the positives.'",
    "But they never mention the thousands of Gypsies that were killed by the Nazis.",
    "And is it really, as one campaign group claimed, 'a celebration of genocide'?",
    "Others have gone further, demanding that viewers cancel their subscriptions.",
    "Doesn't a comedian have the freedom to tell whatever jokes he or she wants?",
    "From what I know of soldiers' sense of humour, I think he's probably right.",
    "Carr has actually given those who want to censor us even more ammunition.",
    "Loyalists to the principle of free speech might regard this as nonsense.",
    "Last night, it had attracted more than 13,000 signatures and counting.",
    "With Carr, they can't pretend they didn't know what they might get.",
