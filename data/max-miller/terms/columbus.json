    "sentence": "Gibbs announced in November that he planned to run for reelection, but the six-term congressman released a statement Wednesday morning saying the slow-moving redistricting “circus” he blames on the court led him to the “difficult decision” to “not seek re-election this year.”\n“It is irresponsible to effectively confirm the congressional map for this election cycle seven days before voting begins,” Gibbs wrote, “especially in the Seventh Congressional District where almost 90 percent of the electorate is new and nearly two thirds is an area primarily from another district, foreign to any expectations or connection to the current Seventh District.”\nThe redrawn, Republican-favoring district would have pitted Gibbs against GOP primary candidates that include <span class='selected-term'>Max Miller</span>, a former White House and campaign aide to Donald Trump who the former president has already endorsed.",
