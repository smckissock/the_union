    "Virginia’s new Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, expanded the focus of his chief diversity, opportunity, and inclusion officer to include restoring equal economic opportunity for all citizens, creating a climate that allows for diversity of thought, restoring constitutionally protected rights in the Commonwealth, and fighting for the unborn.",
    "In Youngkin’s 10th executive order, the governor appointed vice president of the Heritage Foundation’s Feulner Institute, Angela Sailor, as replacement director of the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), after dismissing the former chief, Janice Underwood, and her four staffers.",
    "He also elevated the role to a Cabinet-level position under the new title of “Commonwealth Chief Diversity, Opportunity, & Inclusion Officer.”\nComments:\nHallelujah!",
    "Since we’re each uniquely designed (Imago Dei), we certainly do not need other humans to sort us by some silly, made-up criteria.",
    "The sooner we take back the word (and, more importantly, the idea of) diversity, the better.",
    "God bless Virginia!"
