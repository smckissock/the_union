    "In the opening 29 minutes, Talakai scored two tries and set up another three - including one with an outrageous infield kick for Will Kennedy after a long break - to put his name front of mind for NSW coach Brad Fittler, watching metres away on the sideline.",
    "I guess you start to show your skill.”\nSiosifa Talakai\nTalakai finished the match with 238 running metres from 19 carries, 11 tackle busts and three offloads, torturing opposite Morgan Harper so badly Des Hasler hooked his centre at half-time.",

    "Sharks centre Siosifa Talakai brushes past Morgan Harper.Credit:NRL Photos\nNot only does he steamroll defenders with power and brute strength, he is deceptively quick with the skills and smarts of a halfback to match.",
    "Asked about his representative eligibility with Tonga due to play a mid-season Test against New Zealand on the same weekend as Origin game two, Talakai said: “I definitely want to make myself eligible for NSW.",
    "But has there ever been a 40-minute performance from one player in the NRL era to match what the Sharks centre did at PointsBet Stadium on Thursday night, virtually single-handedly destroying Manly?",
    "Penrith’s Stephen Crichton, Brisbane’s Kotoni Staggs, South Sydney’s Campbell Graham, St George Illawarra’s Zac Lomax, Newcastle’s Bradman Best and even Canterbury’s Matt Burton are all options.",
    "Craig Fitzgibbon’s attacking formation has such fluency and depth - highlighted by the slingshot tactic - opposition defences can’t rush Talakai to cut down his time before he builds momentum.",
    "Perhaps the only powerhouse display from an outside back which can match Talakai in the modern game was Wendell Sailor’s four-try heroics against the Dragons in a 2001 semi-final.",
    "Their owner is apparently Cronulla’s new cult hero, who excelled at Little Athletics as a schoolkid and was a state 1500-metre placegetter for walking in his age group.",
    "Siosifa Talakai produced one of the best halves by any player in the NRL era.Credit:Getty\n“Every game is fun in a way, but I haven’t had one like [Thursday night].",
    "If my back-rower Teig Wilton doesn’t hold up [Daly] Cherry-Evans and stop Morgan Harper for that little bit of space ... it’s not just me, it’s our whole edge.",
    "He knew that I was going to try to take him on the outside, and I saw him become a bit aggressive, so I thought I’d take him on the inside and I pulled it off.",
    "At one stage during his demolition of the Sea Eagles, he handled the ball with just his giant left hand, while using his right to swat away Manly defenders.",
    "But can the 25-year-old, who will next week play his 50th NRL game, be the answer to Fittler’s left-centre conundrum if Latrell Mitchell is unavailable?",
    "And there’s an argument to say if you were creating the perfect modern-day prototype NRL player, then Talakai would almost be it.",
    "Maybe his best chance of an Origin debut is a bench forward, who can play back row but also be used in the middle or at centre.",
    "“I had a point to prove with last year not being up to standard.”\nStream the NRL Premiership 2022 live and free on 9Now.",
    "But there’s little credit being given to the men inside Talakai, who are a huge factor in his early-season success.",
    "It was pretty special.”\nOne clever wag even managed to change Manly’s Wikipedia entry after the Talakai demolition.",
