    "Doug Ducey refused to say Thursday if transgender people actually exist, twice dodging direct questions on the subject just a day after he signed legislation limiting transgender rights.",
    "“That’s what the legislation is intended to do, and that’s what it does.”\nAsked again if he believed there are “actual transgender people,” he again answered slowly and carefully.",
