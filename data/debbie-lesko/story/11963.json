    "Caught Our Eye: It wasn't just a rumor – Last year, House staffers left their jobs at the highest rate in at least 20 years, according to LegiStorm data https://t.co/QSlXGq7WU9\n— LegiStorm (@LegiStorm) March 21, 2022\nReps. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.), Sean Casten (D-Ill.), Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), Pat Fallon (R-Texas), Ken Buck (R-Colo.), Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) made up the rest of the ten worst.",
    "LegiStorm explained the staff turnover index is “salary-weighted, meaning that the departure of a higher-paid staffer, such as a chief of staff, will count proportionately more than that of a staff assistant or other lower-paid staffer.”\nThe website only considers full-time, non-temporary staff.",
    "The summary of the bill states it is “the largest increase in the MRA appropriation since its authorization in 1996.”\nLawmakers’ salaries will remain at $174,000 but they will be able to hire additional staffers and increase existing staffers’ pay with the additional funding.",
    "The Secretary of the Senate was required by law to publish its most recent by November 2021 and has not yet done so.”\nThe report comes just after House Democratic leaders passed their $1.5 trillion omnibus spending bill.",
    "According to the summary, the increase in funding will allow members of Congress to “recruit and retain a talented and diverse workforce.”\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",
    "Then-Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) lost staff at nearly five times the average for the House and Victoria Spartz (R-Ind.)",
    "LegiStorm is “unable to analyze current Senate turnover due to a delay in the Report of the Secretary of the Senate.",
    "According to the report, House Democrats had a more difficult time retaining staff than Republicans.",
    "LegiStorm data shows House staffers quit their jobs at the highest rate in at least 20 years.",
    "Two Republicans did lead the House in the highest turnover rates, as LegiStorm reported.",
    "Staff turnover in the House last year was the worst in decades, according to a report.",
    "The bill includes a 21% increase in funding for congressional offices.",
    "Fifty-five percent more staffers left than in the preceding year.",
    "Democrats lost staffers at a 24% higher rate than Republicans.",
    "lost staff at 3.5 times the average.",
    "It excludes interns and fellows.",
    "Read our editorial standards."
