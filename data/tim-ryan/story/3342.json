    "“Meat, dairy, and eggs are a major component of global human diets, and the raising of livestock is integral to rural economies worldwide, with more than a billion people making all or part of their living from animal agriculture.”\nThe authors add that “substantial global investment will be required to ensure that the people who currently make a living from animal agriculture do not suffer when it is reduced or replaced.” But it’s unclear where such substantial investment would come from.",
    "Pat Brown, a professor emeritus of biochemistry at Stanford University and the founder and CEO of the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods, and Michael Eisen, a professor of genetics and development at the University of California Berkeley, modeled the long-term “climate opportunity cost” of continuing business-as-usual meat and dairy production.",
    "Jenner Images/Getty Images\nWhen I asked Brown about this, he said the share of the global population that relies on subsistence agriculture is shrinking, “and that train is not going to stop,” and points to the West as the main culprit of high food emissions, where a shift to plant-based eating would make the biggest impact for the climate.",
    "It has to be market-driven.”\nEventually — for the reasons Brown and Eisen have bluntly laid out — governments will need to craft policy to change meat and dairy production in order to reach climate targets, especially those of high-income countries, which emit an outsized proportion of the global share of greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Eisen said he hopes the impact would be “for people to realize just what kind of potential climate benefit we’re sitting on.”\nBrown opposes political mandates and insists this shift needs to be market-driven and can be done, pointing to historical precedents like the rapid transition from analog cameras to digital ones.",
    "The study serves more usefully as a thought experiment, illustrating meat and dairy’s enormous carbon footprint, how much humanity would benefit from shifting to plant-based eating, and, hopefully, spurring efforts to reimagine how we produce protein with a growing global population that is eating more meat each year.",
    "Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images\nIf the world were to end all meat and dairy production and transition to a plant-based food system over the next 15 years, it would prevent enough greenhouse gas emissions to effectively cancel out emissions from all other economic sectors for the next 30 to 50 years.",
    "But Brown and Eisen’s research is new in that it looks at the emissions savings from globally phasing out meat and dairy and how it would, in essence, cancel out the yearly forecasted increase in total greenhouse gases from all other sources, like energy and transportation, for 30 to 50 years.",
    "Other changes, like improving agricultural yields, reducing food waste, and reducing the emission intensity of livestock production would help minimize the food system’s environmental toll, the study authors say, but they wouldn’t have near the same effect as phasing out livestock production.",
    "According to the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for alternative proteins — like plant- and cell-based meat — the sector may even have trouble sourcing and producing enough ingredients to meet projected demand by 2030, let alone dominate the food industry in the late 2030s.",
    "Eisen and Brown also found that 90 percent of this emissions reduction could be achieved by just cutting the production of ruminant animals like cows, sheep, and lamb, since they emit high amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas much more potent than carbon dioxide, unlike poultry.",
    "“Every single day we’re not doing something about it, we’re getting further and further down the road to irreversible damage.”\nIt’s obvious but has to be restated: A 15-year phase-out of meat and dairy production is something that is only likely to happen in an academic model.",
    "According to research from the Breakthrough Institute, a tech-focused environmental think tank, a 10 percent reduction in the price of plant-based beef could increase plant-based beef consumption by 23 percent, but it would only reduce cattle production by 0.15 percent.",
    "Olivier Chassignole/AFP via Getty Images\nIt would also be an impossible transition for the estimated 2 billion people, most in the global South, who raise their own animals for food and income, though they eat far less meat than consumers in rich nations.",
    "Research has found that even if we eliminate all fossil fuel use (and emissions from other sectors), the world will not reach the Paris climate agreement’s target of keeping the increase in global temperature to 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels.",
    "It’s a challenge governments and corporations — and the consumers who keep eagerly eating more meat — have largely ignored at our peril, producing ever more burgers, wings, and bacon and racking up a climate tab future generations will be left to pay.",
    "There is a major voluntary effort underway in the UK to do just this, which has seen some success, but it’s also rankled some farmers who worry they’ll be forced to change farming practices and be excluded from key decisions on how UK land is used.",
    "Near-term solutions to increase plant-based eating\nTo be sure, consumers are showing excitement about plant-based foods, thanks in part to more realistic-tasting replicas of burgers, eggs, and poultry made by Impossible Foods and other startups.",
    "“There is an amazing potential to do something that no other existing scalable technology has, which is to actually reduce atmospheric levels of all three major greenhouse gases [methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide],” said Eisen.",
    "Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\nDespite the financial conflict of interest, the science appears solid, according to Matthew Hayek, an assistant environmental studies professor at New York University and a recent Vox contributor.",
    "Big Food isn’t committing to reduce meat and dairy production in the way that large automakers are transitioning their gas-powered fleets to electric, and plant-based meat still makes up less than 1 percent of the retail market.",
    "Aside from the logistical and political impossibility of phasing out meat and dairy production in 15 years, rewilding the land used to house and feed farmed animals would also be met with steep economic and political obstacles.",
    "If plant-and cell-based meat and dairy alternatives can greatly improve in taste and become cost-competitive with animal meat, the political, corporate, and social barriers against widespread adoption might start to weaken.",
    "New research from environmental nonprofit World Resources Institute found that messaging on restaurant menus about the environmental impact of beef can make consumers twice as likely to choose vegetarian options instead.",
    "Piper calls it “swapping one moral disaster for another.”\nBut how exactly would such a phase-out even work for much of the global poor who rely on livestock production for survival and want to eat much more meat?",
    "Just last month, a paper published in Nature Food found that if 54 high-income nations adopted the EAT-Lancet diet — a primarily plant-based diet — they could cut their emissions from food by nearly two-thirds.",
    "The report’s authors model that restoring or “rewilding” all of that land to ecological health would create a massive carbon sink, capturing and storing carbon that otherwise would’ve added to climate change.",
    "First, they calculated the effects of ending animal agriculture — and the high levels of methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide emissions it generates — and replacing it with a plant-only food system.",
    "For example, Burger King UK and Panera Bread aim to make their menus 50 percent vegetarian in coming years, and major European grocer Tesco aims to increase its plant-based food sales 300 percent by 2025.",
    "The paper’s authors say such a shift would “substantially alter the trajectory of global warming,” as animal agriculture is estimated to account for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "Right now, about one-third of Earth’s land is used to feed or house farmed animals, but if everything we ate was directly derived from plants, Brown and Eisen say we’d only need to use 7 percent of it.",
    "“But your funding affects the scope and gamut of research questions that you ask, and the manner in which you aim to solve those questions.” That goes for both pro-meat and anti-meat researchers.",
    "It would be logistically impossible, and it would require significant state action, which is a political nonstarter; regulating meat production and consumption is universally politically toxic.",
    "“But the great thing about it is, you can check the data analysis, and you can do it yourself.”\nWhile the financial stakes are meaningful for Brown, the planetary stakes are high for everyone.",
    "But direct emissions aren’t animal agriculture’s only contribution to climate change; 30 percent of the Earth’s land is used to either raise farmed animals or to grow crops to feed them.",
    "In other words, reducing meat and dairy production isn’t just a nice-to-have in the effort to avert the worst effects of climate change, it’s a significant part of the global toolbox.",
    "“It’s no longer enough to just stop putting stuff into the atmosphere — we have to go backward.”\nA 15-year phase-out of meat and dairy is almost certainly not going to happen.",
    "Influencing consumer behavior and what’s available on fast-food menus and grocery store shelves — market-driven approaches — will be critical, but can only do so much.",
    "To me, this looks like a rigorous analysis of how earth’s atmosphere would physically respond to such a drastic change in agriculture and emissions,” Hayek told me.",
    "The messy mechanics of shifting diets\nThis is not the first study to imagine how a radically different food system would alter the course of climate change.",
    "Plant-based meat prices are coming down, which should also influence consumer uptake, but the impact may not be as big as plant-based boosters would hope.",
    "But as Vox’s Kelsey Piper has written, while poultry may be more efficient from a climate perspective, the industry is an animal welfare catastrophe.",
    "“[It’s] something we have to do.”\n“The current levels of these greenhouse gases are enough to send us over the edge from a climatic sense,” he added.",
    "Financial contributions from our readers are a critical part of supporting our resource-intensive work and help us keep our journalism free for all.",
    "KFC rolled out meatless chicken nationwide last month, and McDonald’s McPlant burger, made with Beyond Meat, lands in 600 locations on February 14.",
    "But the market alone couldn’t make such a swift change happen; plant-based meat accounts for less than 1 percent of the global meat market today.",
    "Sign up for Vox’s five-day newsletter full of practical tips — and food for thought — to incorporate more plant-based food into your diet.",
    "The plant-based industry is growing rapidly, and Big Food is starting to incorporate plant-based food into its broader climate pledges.",
    "Brown’s Impossible Foods is a highly valued maker of plant-based beef, pork, and chicken, while Eisen is an adviser for the company.",
    "“The transition away from animal agriculture will face many obstacles and create many challenges,” the authors write.",
    "However, the organization says that while the politics of meat feel quite fixed today, that could quickly change.",
    "They said they want the climate community to pay more attention to the food system’s role in the climate crisis.",
    "Chickens are treated much worse than cattle because they’re so small and they’re farmed in much higher numbers.",
    "Big Food is selling more plant-based meat and dairy, but not fast enough to rapidly change the food system.",
    "And it’s worth noting that a massive shift to plant-based eating would financially benefit Brown and Eisen.",
    "We’d still need land to support a plant-based food system, but far less, according to Brown and Eisen.",
    "Our mission has never been more vital than it is in this moment: to empower through understanding.",
    "“You should be skeptical, and you should take into account any conflict of interest for authors.",
    "That critical question gets some attention in the study, but not a thorough investigation.",
    "“Try and force people to change their diets, you’re not going to be their friend anymore.",
    "(68 billion chickens globally are raised each year compared to 302 million cattle.)",
    "“Your background doesn’t necessarily have to impact the rigor of your results.",
    "That’s according to new research published today in the journal PLOS Climate.",
    "“The rapidity is just as important as the magnitude,” Brown told me.",
    "(Seafood’s environmental impact was not included in the analysis.)",
    "Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.",
    "“Try to regulate [meat], you get thrown out of office,” he said.",
    "Tim Ryan Williams/Vox\nEducation and framing could help.",
    "But these types of launches and pledges are additive.",
    "Want to eat less meat but don’t know where to start?",
    "Please consider making a contribution to Vox today.",
    "Why did Brown and Eisen model a 15-year phase-out?",
    "The authors disclose their conflicts in the paper.",
    "Brown says this change has to be market-driven.",
    "Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?",
    "Both are shareholders in the company.",
    "Brown said he encourages skepticism.",
    "And humanity needs to act soon.",
    "I always do that,” he said."
