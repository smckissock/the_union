    "(Cleveland) - While all the major Republicans running for Rob Portman's soon-to-be-vacant US Senate seat have been trying to partner themselves with former President Donald Trump, the one who will get his endorsement will be author and political newcomer JD Vance,\nIn a statement issued through a PAC controlled by Trump, he said Vance would be the best candidate to take on U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democrat from the Mahoning Valley, who is far ahead in the race for the Democratic nomination.,\nTrump said he was very aware that Vance once said he was a \"never Trump guy,\" but said that Vance now sees the light, saying “Like some others, JD Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades.",
    "He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race.”\n(Copyright 2022 iHeartMedia)\nListen to WTAM for news at the top and bottom of the hour"
