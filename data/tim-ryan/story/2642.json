    "Sign Up\nThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\nJosh Mandel, Ohio state treasurer, at a campaign stop for Sen. Marco Rubio, then a Republican presidential candidate, in Cleveland in 2015.Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters file\n‘He seemed like a totally normal, regular Republican’\nAmbition drove Mandel more than ideology early in his career, and establishment Republicans who saw in him a young and polite Jewish veteran who clicked with swing voters were eager to accommodate his quick rise.",
    "“The level of vitriol that we saw from Josh in 2012, the willingness to get into the mud with false personal attacks and sort of a sociopathic-like ability to lie, even in the face of overwhelming evidence about any given issue, really foreshadowed the comfort in which Josh would slide into the darker elements of Donald Trump’s mold of the Republican Party,” said Justin Barasky, a longtime Brown adviser and Democratic media consultant who works with Ryan.",
    "Nevertheless, he continues to tap out provocative material, whether he’s burning a Covid mask in a stairwell or comparing Afghan refugees to predatory “alligators.” In December, he nearly missed a flight home from New York after he detoured to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Queens, where he tweeted a video in support of a veteran who had recently been arrested after having protested the city’s Covid vaccination requirement for indoor dining.",
    "Mandel was so proud of one recently rejected tweet — an attack on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — that he scrolled through the group chat until he found it, then held his phone up for display: “CO2 is not a pollutant but AOC is.”\nHis campaign manager, Scott Guthrie, had texted back a blunt ruling: “No.”\n(After this article was published, Mandel tweeted it.)",
    "In Hudson, after having shared a lighthearted story about his kids, he whipped up anger against transgender people by wondering whether his 8-year-old daughter, a taekwondo student, might eventually have to compete against a “biological male.”\nHe also courts evangelical Christians, visiting churches and talking more about religion than he did in past campaigns.",
    "“But there’s only one candidate that consistently says in every audience — whether it’s Hudson, Ohio, or Cincinnati, Ohio, or Toledo or Marietta — what I am about to say to you … that I believe the 2020 election was stolen from Donald J. Trump.”\nTrump’s rise reflected and reinforced the politics that Mandel had been practicing in Ohio for years.",
    "Guthrie, Mandel's campaign manager, said the campaign considers Cox’s recollections to be “made up by a Never Trumper who seems to hate Josh due to Josh’s conservative values and support for Trump.”\nMandel’s shift to the right became more noticeable in 2010, the year he dabbled in religious bigotry while running for state treasurer.",
    "“He’s someone who shows up for pictures and to steal donors,” said an adviser to the 2020 Trump Victory Finance Committee, who requested anonymity to speak candidly while recalling the time last year when Mandel attempted to crash a Republican National Committee donor retreat without an invitation.",
    "Mandel relies on rhetorical straw men, bragging that he says the things that the media and “squishy RINOs” — Republicans In Name Only — don’t think he should: that the election was stolen from Trump, that mask and vaccination mandates are terrible, that there are only two genders.",
    "“I think the reason why we’re still up double digits without spending any money on advertising is that over the years I’ve built this grassroots army of conservatives who know that I have the guts to take on Republicans when they’re acting like Democrats,” Mandel said last month.",
    "“When you’re in a state with so many Republican elected officials, it’s hard not to fight amongst the party instead of Democrats, because there are not many Democrats,” said state Sen. Niraj Antani, a Republican who has remained neutral in this year’s Senate primary.",
    "Mandel and his wife divorced in early 2020, and he had money left over from his 2018 campaign — a sore spot with activists who wished he had done more to help Jim Renacci, who replaced him on the ballot and was soundly defeated by Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.",
    "A few months later, attempting to get ahead of a story that campaign officials feared might damage Mandel if it wasn’t tightly controlled, Wilson wrote a Toledo Blade guest column about a November 2020 miscarriage of the child she and Mandel were expecting.",
    "After he graduated from Ohio State University, where he was a student government president, Mandel joined the Marines and served two tours in Iraq sandwiched between elections to the Lyndhurst City Council in Cleveland’s eastern suburbs and the Ohio House.",
    "He worried that the GOP was “on the wrong side of history” on the issue, said Cox, who is no longer close with Mandel and has donated to two of his 2022 rivals, Republican Matt Dolan and Rep. Tim Ryan, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.",
    "“It’s his reaction to the changing nature of politics.”\n‘You should see the stuff that doesn’t get online’\nFew trends reflect the altered landscape better than Twitter, which was less of a political weapon during Mandel’s first run for Senate.",
    "In interviews with more than a dozen politicians, activists and operatives familiar with his career, a common observation dwelled on Mandel’s gift for self-promotion and his knack for identifying problems but his unwillingness to compromise.",
    "A typical Mandel speech incorporates several biographical points of pride: his Jewish grandparents who survived the Holocaust, his military service, his scrapes with John Kasich, a former Ohio governor and a loud anti-Trumper.",
    "A Republican who, like Mandel, was swept into statewide office on the 2010 tea party wave, Kasich eventually expanded Medicaid, pushed for a fracking tax and presented himself as a pragmatist in his own presidential campaign.",
    "His sincerity may be in question, but Mandel’s sense of where the GOP was headed — from a tea party movement steeped in fiscal conservatism to a personality-driven politics rooted in tribalism — proved correct.",
    "HUDSON, Ohio — On his way to winning the Ohio treasurer’s office in 2010, Josh Mandel aired a TV ad suggesting his opponent had ties to a mosque — a misleading attack quickly condemned for its anti-Muslim tone.",
    "“You should see the stuff that doesn’t get online,” he said with a laugh as he opened the text-messaging app on his iPhone to reveal a “Twitter approval thread” that the campaign uses to workshop his tweets.",
    "“He seemed like a totally normal, regular Republican,” said Matt Cox, a former Republican leader in Cuyahoga County who developed a close relationship with Mandel after he recruited him for campaign work.",
    "His priorities back then tended to have a populist flair — a small property tax rebate in Lyndhurst and a push for state pension funds to divest from Iran, to name two examples — and attract publicity.",
    "“I mean, he was willing to fight battles where he could pay a very dear personal price for doing so,” said Lori Viars, a conservative activist from the Cincinnati area who is supporting Mandel.",
    "A poll taken around that time by the Club for Growth, a conservative group that supports his candidacy, showed him in first place but with a smaller share of the vote than in previous surveys.",
    "“He still did what was right.”\nOthers suspect Mandel was itching to stand out in a Republican-dominated state where establishment leaders like Kasich and Portman had built national brands.",
    "And ahead of his expected rematch with Brown in 2018, Mandel defended right-wing conspiracy theorists Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec against criticism from the Anti-Defamation League.",
    "Several fundraising aides left the campaign last year, citing a toxic workplace created by Mandel’s finance director and girlfriend, Rachel Wilson, according to The Columbus Dispatch.",
    "The timing might finally be right for Mandel, who lost his first Senate race in 2012 and abruptly dropped out of a second campaign in 2018 citing a health issue with his then-wife.",
    "In an Ohio primary that stands out nationally with so many candidates willing to say or do anything to win Trump’s endorsement, no candidate is saying or doing more than Mandel.",
    "Then he disappeared, only to come back and be an even worse version of what he was.”\nWhether all of that is enough for a Trump endorsement, Mandel isn’t sure.",
    "Today, Mandel boasts that he was the first statewide Republican officeholder to back Trump, citing as evidence the top staffers he sent to Trump’s Ohio team.",
    "But the tactics he employed then, and the right-wing identity he has been refining ever since, are now staples of a GOP led by former President Donald Trump.",
    "And although Mandel raised $500,000 for Trump’s re-election bid, veterans of the 2016 and 2020 campaigns described Mandel’s public involvement as minimal.",
    "(A lesser-known Senate candidate made headlines after having aired a radio ad that called Mandel, who is Jewish, a “phony” for talking about the Bible.)",
    "I said, ‘You’re unrecognizable now from who you were when we first met and when you were first in politics.’ Then a couple months later, he dropped out.",
    "In Mandel, he would have the front-runner in the polls and the candidate most deeply committed to his debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen.",
    "“Ilhan Omar should be deported not supported,” Mandel tweeted in June, referring to the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, a Somali-born Muslim.",
    "Cox, who at the time was managing a renewal campaign for a publicly funded economic development program, was counting on his friend’s endorsement.",
    "“Josh’s calculation,” the adviser added in a remark that reflects the feelings of some in Trump’s world, “has always been about Josh.\"",
    "Mandel launched his Senate campaign a year ago, soon after Republican incumbent Rob Portman announced he wouldn’t seek a third term.",
    "Even so, Mandel can’t shake the criticism that he’s a shape-shifter, a charge that those who know him best say is oversimplified.",
    "In an interview last month after his speech in Hudson, Mandel flashed a mischievous grin when asked about his Twitter strategy.",
    "“There’s, like, 84 people running,” Mandel joked to an audience last month in this upscale suburb between Akron and Cleveland.",
    "Today he uses it to serve up the kind of outrage that Trump reveled in before the social media platform banned him last year.",
    "Mandel argues against the separation of church and state and pushes Judeo-Christian values, at times to Islamophobic effect.",
    "He echoes Trump’s grievances, fights the culture wars that energize the party’s base and indulges in racial stereotypes.",
    "“What you’re seeing is not a change in Josh,” said Jonathan Petrea, who managed his Ohio House campaigns in the 2000s.",
    "And although Mandel is independently wealthy, he’s the only candidate in the primary who isn’t self-funding so far.",
    "Mandel’s own account was briefly restricted last year after he tweeted stereotypes about Mexicans and Muslims.",
    "Mandel, then 33 and harboring ambitions of a long career in Republican politics, eventually apologized.",
    "Mandel had his doubts about Trump in 2016, and he endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in the primaries.",
    "No one is sure who will strike first to define Mandel to voters — Mandel himself or one of his rivals.",
    "The former president weighs loyalty and the likelihood of winning when he decides whom to endorse.",
    "Cox and others remember him privately expressing support for gay marriage before it was legal.",
    "“I was speaking on behalf of all of our friends who had spent the last 15, 18 years with him.",

    "Mandel opposed Kasich each time, strengthening his credentials with the right.",
    "Through this week, no other Republican in the race had spent less on ads.",
