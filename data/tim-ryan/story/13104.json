    "Retirees would get lump sum payment plus interest\nPortman said under the so-called Susan Muffley Act — named for a woman whose husband saw his pension slashed and who died of pancreatic cancer after having foregone medical attention due to her family's finances — it would ultimately be up to the PBGC to determine how much it would cost to restore the pensions, but his office estimated it at about $1 billion.",
    "But if that turns out to be the cost, Portman argued Thursday, it's justified, given that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. (PBGC), the nation's insurer of last resort of terminated pension plans, treated the employees unfairly when it slashed benefits for some 20,000 workers of the bankrupt Troy-based auto supplier, thousands of whom live in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and New York.",
    "On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, unveiled legislation intended to restore those pensions, which were cut by as much as 70% in some cases after the PBGC took over the plan in 2009 even as union workers, mostly represented by the UAW, saw their pensions topped off to their full amount by General Motors.",
    "At the time, GM was under pressure to make sure union workers got their full pensions as it needed Delphi's workers to produce auto parts and the UAW's agreement as it reorganized under a financing plan and bankruptcy arranged by President Barack Obama's auto task force to rescue the automaker from liquidation.",
    "But no such pressure existed for GM or the government to make sure salaried employees at Delphi, which was spun off by GM in 1999, got the same consideration, leading to 13 years of claims of unfair treatment and legal battles and lobbying among the auto suppliers' former workers to get their pensions restored.",
    "If the legislation were to pass as written, pensioners or their beneficiaries would not only have their benefits restored, but receive a lump sum payment for the difference between what they have received and their full benefits dating back to the plan's termination, plus 6% annual interest on that amount.",
    "More:For Delphi's former salaried workers, retirement has been a long fight for fair treatment\nIn the House, cosponsors include Democratic Reps. Debbie Dingell of Dearborn and Tim Ryan and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio; and Republican Reps. Michael Turner, Bill Johnson and Warren Davidson of Ohio.",
    "In recent years, the plight of the pensioners has received bipartisan support from governors, attorneys general, legislators and others, but without much success beyond a health care tax credit to help reduce the cost of replacing health insurance lost in Delphi's bankruptcy.",
    "Rob Portman, a key supporter of legislation that would fully restore the pensions of Delphi's salaried employees cut more than a decade ago by a government-charted agency, said the measure could cost the U.S. Treasury upwards of $1.1 billion.",
    "One stumbling block may be whether the administration feels it could, or should, approve legislation overriding a decision made by the PBGC, which, while government-chartered, has operated as a largely independent corporation.",
    "Officials with the Delphi Salaried Retirees Association, which has been fighting for more than a decade to get the pensions restored, said Thursday that its members will continue to lobby to get the measure passed.",
    "And it's unclear whether the Biden administration would support the legislation as proposed, though Kildee and others said they have been in discussions with the White House about the measure.",
    "\"These retirees have worked hard, they played by the rules ... and they had the rug pulled out from under them and that's not right,\" Kildee, who is the prime sponsor of the bill, said.",
    "\"These people (the retirees) were as necessary for the company to function as the workers on the production line,\" said Bruce Gump, chairman of the DSRA's board.",
    "Before being elected, then-candidate Joe Biden also expressed sympathy for the pensioners, but his administration last year said there was nothing it could do.",
    "With the U.S. Supreme Court declining early this year to take up the retirees' case, a legislative solution may be their last, best hope of redress.",
    "\"Democratic and Republican administrations haven't fixed this problem, so Democratic and Republican members of Congress will.\"",
    "In 2020, then-President Donald Trump made mention of it on the campaign trail but nothing happened afterward.",
    "\"If it passes, all those who support it will be superheroes to us... It’s been a long 13-year nightmare.",
    "Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; and Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters of Michigan are introducing the bill.",
    "\"It's just become obvious that a legislative solution is the only fix,\" Kildee said.",
    "Read more onMichigan politics and sign up for ourelections newsletter.",
    "\"All this was earned (by the employees),\" the Ohio Republican said.",
    "In the Senate, Portman, along with Democratic U.S. Sens.",
    "Contact Todd Spangler attspangler@freepress.com.",
    "Follow him on Twitter@tsspangler.",
    "It’s time for it to end.\"",
