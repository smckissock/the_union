    "Its language, which is modeled after the national Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) that President Bill Clinton signed in 1993, bans the government from forcing anyone to violate his or her deeply held religious beliefs unless it can prove it is acting in “furtherance of a compelling government interest” and using “the least restrictive means” possible.",
