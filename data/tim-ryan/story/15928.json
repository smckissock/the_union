    "MOUNT VERNON – Democrat Tim Ryan brought his campaign for the U.S. Senate to Knox County on Thursday, sharing his message that he wants to position communities like Mount Vernon for manufacturing growth and fight for investment in infrastructure and jobs.",
    "“And so at a very young age, I wanted to be a part of trying to make that right and help these families that had lost the jobs or had to move to Indiana or Michigan or wherever to go follow the work,” he said.",
    "“So, I want Ohio to be on the cutting edge of these new industries, which will mean long-sustained jobs, jobs for people that pay well.”\nOhio needs to be positioned as a leader in this generation of industry.",
    "His legislative plans would be “continuing to have an aggressive program to reassure companies to the U.S., like the Intel deal, really focusing on manufacturing jobs,” Ryan said.",
    "“And I think people vote for somebody who understands that, and I understand that better than anybody in this race.”\nHis campaign has taken him to 80 of the state’s 88 counties.",
    "“We're going to see people everywhere, meeting them and learning about their communities and what the opportunities are in these communities,” he said.",
    "Upon election to the Senate, he would push for the passage and expansion of the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which passed the House on Feb. 4.",
    "He said Ohio once dominated industries, whether it was Akron and rubber, glass in Toledo, or energy and agriculture across the state.",
    "They ignored the community and didn’t have the people’ best interest in mind by outsourcing jobs to China and Mexico, he said.",
    "He plans to win by showing the people he will be a fighter for Ohio, for the people who live in what he calls “real” America.",
    "He’d bring shop class back, invest money in vocational schools and get away from the idea that everybody must go to college.",
    "And that's what I'm going to fight for.”\nHe got started in politics after being ignored by a lot of politicians growing up.",
    "“We dominated those industries, and now new industries are emerging and China's dominating them,” he said.",
    "“I know what they've been through, because my family and my community has been through it, too,” he said.",
    "Young people will need skills that might require just a bit more training after high school, he said.",
    "Ryan held a meet-and-greet at Knox County Democratic Headquarters at 9 East Vine St. in Mount Vernon.",
    "“The infrastructure investment that passed a few months back, I worked closely with Sen. Portman on.",
    "The U.S. only has 330 million people to compete with China’s population of 1.4 billion.",
    "Being in the Senate would be a position where Ryan said he could make a difference.",
    "Ohio has always built things, and now competition with China is the country’s No.",

    "It's going to create almost 600,000 jobs in Ohio,” Ryan said.",
    "They do not share our values,” he said.",
    "“People really appreciate it.”",
    "1 issue, he said."
