    "“It's just flat-lined as far as leadership in trying to help school districts get to the immediate matter and help our children catch up, especially in the urban districts, especially in those schools that had to teach remotely,” said state Sen. Teresa Fedor (D., Toledo), Mr. Cranley's would-be lieutenant governor, a former public school teacher, and ranking Democrat on the Senate Primary and Secondary Education Committee.",
    "“We did the best we could, but it is a moral imperative that [lawmakers] actually do something, and they haven't, like they haven't for 25 years in public education.”\nFree and reduced-price breakfast and lunch would be served during summer school to qualifying students as well as transportation for all students.",
    "Possibly..., but we are proposing that this be offered immediately to catch up many families ... that were chronically absent because of COVID.”\nMr. Cranley is competing against a former fellow mayor, Dayton's Nan Whaley, for the Democratic nomination in hopes of ultimately replacing Republican Gov.",
    "The proposal is designed to help students who spent significant parts of the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years in remote learning because of the pandemic, leading to higher-than-usual absenteeism, lower test scores, and an underscoring of disparities when it comes to online learning.",
    "It’s estimated that a one-time, six-week summer school program would cost between $68 million, if it targets just chronically absent students had who had not been previously absent, to about $740 million if every student took advantage of it, an unlikely scenario.",
    "Governor DeWine has been encouraging local school boards to use these funds to focus on catching kids up that may have been adversely affected.”\nSo far, just about 21 percent of the federal relief dollars tied to education have been spent.",
    "COLUMBUS — Democratic gubernatorial hopeful John Cranley on Monday called for Ohio to fund a summer school program this year that would last at least six weeks to help students who fell behind during coronavirus-imposed remote learning.",
    "Not only has this program helped Dayton’s kids come to kindergarten more prepared, but it’s spurred growth among Black and women-owned small businesses in Dayton and helped families to afford the increasingly high cost of childcare.\"",
    "The former Cincinnati mayor said the state should use some of the $7.9 billion that the Ohio Department of Education has received in federal coronavirus relief.",
    "The program would be voluntary for students as well as teachers who would receive additional compensation, but districts would be mandated to make it an option.",
    "“That's why, last fall I called on Governor DeWine to do whatever was necessary to keep kids in school, in person, to minimize learning loss from the pandemic.",
    "On the GOP side, Mr. DeWine faces opposition from cattle farmer Joe Blystone, former U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, and former state Rep. Ron Hood.",
    "The program would be open to public, private, and charter school students, although it would be housed in a public school building.",
    "Much of the current school year has proceeded with in-person instruction, often with masking and social distancing requirements.",
    "School districts already have the choice to use their shares of federal dollars for remedial efforts, including summer school.",
    "And Mr. Cranley is calling for it to happen now on Mr. DeWine's watch rather than wait until after this year's election.",
    "And it's why I spearheaded implementing high-quality, universal preschool for every 3 and 4-year-old as mayor of Dayton.",
    "“Such a program already exists, including $89 million in summer school grants,” DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said.",
    "“COVID was a unique, once-in-a-100-year crisis, and this is meant to be a fix to that,” Mr. Cranley said.",
    "\"Ohio schools will have access to $6.5 billion in relief funds of their own from the federal government.",
    "\"Preparing our kids for the future should be our state's top priority,” Ms. Whaley said.",
    "But some schools have occasionally reverted to remote learning during outbreaks.",
    "They have to file plans with the state explaining how they would use the money.",
    "“We've heard over and over the nightmare scenarios,” she said.",
    "Early voting is already under way for the May 3 election.",
    "Virtual school students would have to attend in person.",
