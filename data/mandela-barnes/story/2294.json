    "This is just the latest in a long laundry list of anti-vaccine bull shit he's spewed:\nThis is not the first time Johnson, who is up for re-election this fall, has spread conspiracy theories about COVID-19 or connected the pandemic to AIDS.",
    "In December, on world AIDS day, Johnson said in an appearance on Fox News Host Brian Kilmeade's radio show that Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, overhyped? the AIDS crisis in the 1980s.",
    "pic.twitter.com/BhnulgiasF\n Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) May 3, 2022\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said during a video interview that it \"may be true\" that COVID-19 vaccines cause AIDS.",
    "The COVID-19 vaccines do not compromise the body's immune system, but rather stimulate it to recognize and more easily defend against the disease, which has killed nearly 1 million Americans.",
    "Johnson has been a staunch advocate for the use of the antiparasitic veterinary drug Ivermectin to treat COVID-19, which large studies have proved is ineffective at treating the virus.",
    "So until we get a larger percentage of the population with their eyes open to woah, these vaccine injuries are real, why?' You know, it's gotta be step by step.",

    "Everything you say may be true, OK, but right now the public views the vaccines as largely safe and effective, that vaccine injuries are rare and mild.",
    "Sen. Ron Johnson (R. WI)\nOh for fuck's sake:\nx\nOn Rumble, anti-vaxxer Todd Callender says [COVID] shots caused vaccine-induced AIDS.",
    "You can't leap to another Nuremberg trial.?\nThe AIDS claim is false, according to independent fact-checkers.",
    "He created all kinds of fear, saying it could affect the entire population when it couldn't,? Johnson said.",
    "He also suggested in a town hall that gargling mouthwash could be an effective treatment.",
    "Health and Democracy are on the ballot next year and we need to keep Wisconsin Blue.",
    "They purposefully gave people AIDS.?\nRon Johnson: \"You gotta do one step at a time.",
    "But right now, the public views the vaccines as largely safe and effective.\"",
    "That's the narrative, that's what the vast majority of the public accepts.",
