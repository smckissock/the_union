    "So that same structure allowed us to make a couple of other distinctions, which is that I'm not a democratic socialist  and I think that's an important distinction, because that [infrastructure] bill is going to bring a lot of our jobs to our state, and it turns out that the democratic socialists opposed it.?\n\nFetterman's campaign said he has never described himself as a socialist, noting that as far back as his first run for Senate in 2016, he said in an interview that I don't label myself a democratic socialist.? The Lamb team pointed to articles in which reporters have called Fetterman a self-described democratic socialist,? but were not able to provide any clips in which he has called himself that.",
    "They also both supported his second major program, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which will make a lot of progress in areas such as replacing lead pipes which poison drinking water (EPA estimates there are 6 to 10 million of these pipes across America) and repairing roads and bridges, which is of course necessary even as we move more and more to using eco-friendlier vehicles  which this legislation also invests in, as well as in public transportation and expanding broadband access.",

Malcolm Kenyatta (@malcolmkenyatta) December 22, 2021\nAs are other senatorial candidates across the country, for example\nLucas Kunce (Missouri)\nx\nJoe Manchin was a always reliable \"Yes\" vote on spending trillions of dollars sending me and my buddies out to fight and die in wars for oil.",
    "For example, it's been reported that Manchin has floated investing $1.8T to fund universal pre-K (a program already available in his home state), expansion of the ACA, and climate action, but he won't support continuing the child tax credit (which has had such a tremendous impact on reducing poverty).",
    "They've stymied popular and crucially needed investments and reforms, and Democratic candidates can and should certainly highlight this in their campaign messaging about why we need to elect more Democrats who are firmly committed to supporting a progressive agenda.",
    "He acknowledged that he was referencing Fetterman when he tweeted recently that I'M NOT YOUR GUY? if you want a Senator who runs as a Socialist.?\nHe said Fetterman often critiques Manchin and Sinema at events at which the two Senate candidates are present.",
    "x\n\"Manchin's current decision is an egregious betrayal of working people,\" said Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta..\n\"It proves how important it is for us to elect working people who know in their bones what it means when government works or doesn't.",
    "First, we have seen in the past that they actually will support progressive legislation; both of them voted for President Biden's first major program, the American Rescue Plan, which has helped reduce poverty in America to the lowest level on record.",
    "So though they are hardly model Democrats, it's reasonable to believe that there is some version of a Build Back Better bill with substantial investments in progressive programs that Manchin and Sinema would support.",
    "So Opportunity #1 for Democrats is to pass whatever progressive legislation has Manchin and Sinema's blessing, because passing a BBB bill with some good progressive programs in it is far better than passing no bill.",
    "Politico:\nFetterman has spent months promising to be the 51st vote? for Biden's agenda, vowing that he will NOT be a Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema-type senator,? and lashing Manchin for backing the filibuster.",
    "If we can muster a net gain of two Senate seats  add two progressive members to our caucus  then we'll no longer be threatened by the possibility of Manchin and/or Sinema defecting to the GOP.",

    "That's exactly the messaging we need: the way to achieve a robust and popular Democratic agenda is to elect candidates who support a robust and popular Democratic agenda.",
    "Lamb, who polls second behind Fetterman and was outraised by him $9.3 million to $2.6 million as of last quarter, escalated his attacks in an interview with POLITICO.",
    "Rather than decrying Manchin's obstructionism, Lamb is jabbing the left wing of the Democratic caucus with messaging that sounds like that of Manchin himself.",
    "John Fetterman (D-PA)\nOpportunity #2 is to take advantage of the tremendous anger that so many voters rightly have toward Manchin and Sinema's obstructionism.",
    "Let's show them we're NOT backing down: https://t.co/4OXYM6kWP5 pic.twitter.com/o6xQ538lJz\n Mandela Barnes (@TheOtherMandela) December 20, 2021",
    "Who knows exactly what and how much investment he would end up supporting, but his and Sinema's votes on a BBB bill are likely attainable.",
    "Messaging that takes advantage of voter outrage toward Manchin and Sinema can help turn his tongue-in-cheek advice into reality.",
    "Manchin himself has remarked that if we want to pass the legislation that he opposes, we should elect more progressives.",
    "By contrast, one of Fetterman's primary opponents, U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, is, I think, taking the exactly wrong approach.",
    "But another competitor, Pennsylvania State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, is aiming his messaging in the right direction.",
    "Working people in Ohio and West Virginia need a break and this is our chance to give it to them.",
