    "From a crowded field, Wisconsin Democrats would be wise to select someone able to keep the focus on Johnson's do-nothing record, rather than his insistence that Democrats are a bunch of socialists.",

    "He stresses the need to build more things in America? to avoid supply chain issues and grow the economy, and to build a ready workforce through visa reform and investment in technical schools.",
    "On the economy, Lasry lists the child tax credit and deductibility of union dues as ways to put money in people's pockets,? along with his plan to hold down the cost of prescription drugs.",
    "Like President Biden, Lasry favors strengthening the Affordable Care Act and controlling prescription drug costs  but not Medicare-for-all, as initial front-runner Lt. Gov.",
    "Calling him South Carolina's third senator,? Lasry chides Johnson for letting Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense go out of state with its lucrative contract to build new U.S.",
    "Instead, Johnson seemed to suggest Wisconsin didn't need the work and didn't have a ready labor force: It's not like we don't have enough jobs here in Wisconsin.",

    "We should be the Green Belt.? He points to the need to invest in the wind industry, car battery manufacturing and environmental cleanup.",

    "He says that if you want to go work for Google or JPMorgan, great,? but don't expect taxpayers to pay off your debt.",
    "100 percent.? However, voters are a little tired of fighting [in Washington] and want to see results.",
