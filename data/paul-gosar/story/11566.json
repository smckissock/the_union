    "But now that he replied to his own tweet with this picture tweet that I can masturbate to, well, sure, I’ll believe any load of c*** he throws my way.”\n“Even in the cesspool of human degradation and idle verbal smut that is the Twitterverse, these are the kind of comments you’d typically only see from an anonymous troll account with 5 followers that some bitter and most likely severely mentally ill person would create to stalk and harass people with whom they disagree on politics or culture,” the author of the WND piece contended.",
    "At the request of the South Dakota Democratic Party, Ryan Ryder is withdrawing his candidacy for U.S. House of Representatives.https://t.co/XfRa35yxdV\n— SD Democratic Party (@SoDakDems) March 3, 2022\n“It might seem stunning to us that Ryder didn’t consider these tweets could come back to haunt him so soon into his political career, but here’s the really sick part: To many on the left, this kind of language is considered completely acceptable when it’s hurled at the ‘deplorables’ online,” the report added.",
    "“This dude has sat back and observed the last five years of vehement, foaming-at-the-mouth cancel culture, witnessed countless public figures shamefully grovel before the masses for, say, once liking a tweet that included a Jordan Peterson quote, or something, and yet he didn’t put two and two together and consider that his violent, sexually-charged comments just might come back to bite him once he decided to throw his hat in the ring for the U.S. House of Representatives?” the piece continued.",
    "“While last week, when Ryder announced his candidacy, he said he ‘respects’ Johnson, back in November, he was apparently of the belief that the same had inadequately condemned his colleague’s tasteless tweet and wrote, ‘Thinking about making an animated video of me killing @RepDustyJohnson’s family, and then saying it was just a joke,’ speculating the lawmaker would be ‘fine with that,'” the report continued.",
    "“The first offending tweet was one he issued in November 2021, during the fallout over a video that Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona had tweeted out which portrayed him ‘killing’ Democratic Congresswoman and socialist darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and attacking President Joe Biden (whose faces were superimposed on anime characters),” the report continued.",
    "“Yet for some completely inexplicable reason, Democrat Ryan Ryder didn’t expect that, in 2022, his social media accounts would be combed through with the precision of an anxious mother inspecting her 7-year-old’s head after a school-wide lice outbreak, but considering the nature of his unguarded comments, he most certainly ought to have done,” the WND report said.",
    "(TeaParty.org Exclusive) – A new report from WND has revealed that a Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives yanked his candidacy just one day after old tweets surfaced which featured him sharing sarcastic and violent commentary concerning his potential opponent and cracked jokes concerning masturbating to photographs of South Dakota Gov.",
    "Here’s a statement: pic.twitter.com/0q68lhd0RY\n— Austin Goss (@AustinGossSD) March 3, 2022\n“The South Dakota Democratic Party has determined it is not appropriate for Mr. Ryder to continue in this race and requested that he end his candidacy, which he has agreed to,” the party’s Executive Director Berk Ehrmantraut stated.",
    "However, Dakota News Now reported at the time that within hours of making his announcement, concerned individuals took a look at Ryder’s Twitter account, which then led to his decision, made rather swiftly, to pull out of the race.",
    "Just look at all of the sex scandals that have rocked Democratic politicians in recent years, along with leftists in the media, like all the shenanigans over at CNN involving their producers and underage girls.",
    "I apologize specifically to the state party and anyone else for whom these tweets reflected badly,” Ryder went on to say in a statement on March 3, which was just one day after he’d announced his candidacy.",
    "He then seemed to express more sincere violent thoughts toward Johnson on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol building, going on to declare, “You are a complete and utter fraud.",
    "It’s too bad that the Trump rioters that you continue to support didn’t get you that day.”\nAnother tweet featured Ryder making quips about masturbating to a rather fetching picture of Gov.",
    "Now, before you think this man recognized his awful, crude, and gross behavior as being wrong and decided to do the right thing, it’s important to note that he did not bow out on his own.",
    "“These statements from Mr. Ryder do not live up to the values of the South Dakota Democratic Party, and we do not support this type of language,” Chair Randy Seiler remarked.",
    "Ryder, who works as an attorney and is a veteran of the Air Force, announced his candidacy for Congress on Wednesday, running against current incumbent GOP Rep.",
