    "Fuentes joked that he'd get a call from his lawyer afterward.pic.twitter.com/N0nX0maXrZ\n— David Weigel (@David Weigel) 1614427957\nFuentes views AFPAC as a white nationalist alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and the MAGA Republicans who participated in AFPAC 2022 in late February included Gosar as well as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Idaho Lt. Gov.",
    "Gosar was billed as a “featured guest” at the event, which, Ecarma notes, “happens to coincide with Adolf Hitler’s birthday.”\n“Shortly after the Arizona Mirror reported Gosar’s billing at the event, which the House lawmaker had also promoted on his own Instagram account, the Republican’s campaign consultant claimed full ignorance,” Ecarma explains.",
    "“Yes, this keeps happening.”\nUSE CODE \\u201cEARLYBIRD\\u201dpic.twitter.com/w9TdkuNYVa\n— American Populist Union (@American Populist Union) 1648850053\nRory McShane, a campaign consultant for Gosar, told the Washington Post, “I never approved this event and have never spoken to this group.” And American Populist Union leader C.J.",

Paul Gosar got off the stage.",
    "But Ecarma notes that Gosar “hasn’t always tried to distance himself from his apparent ties to the far right.” And that includes his association with Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist and Holocaust denier who founded the annual America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC).",
    "In June 2021, Ecarma recalls, Gosar “appeared to defend Fuentes\" after a flyer “surfaced showing” that he “was set to hold a fundraiser with the AFPAC founder.” And Gosar claimed “the left” was overreacting to his association with Fuentes, who calls his followers Groypers.",
    "Another controversy involving Gosar occurred in November 2021, when the MAGA congressman was censured by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives for posting an animated video that depicted him murdering Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City.",
    "But journalist Caleb Ecarma, in an article published by Vanity Fair on April 7, stresses that such interactions keep happening despite Gosar’s occasional attempts to downplay them.",
    "At times, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona and members of his staff will try to downplay the far-right MAGA Republican’s interactions with white nationalists and white supremacists.",
    "The most recent example, according to Ecarma, was an American Populist Union event scheduled for April 20 in Tempe, Arizona.",
    "Trapeur told the Post that it is merely a coincidence that April 20 is Hitler’s birthday.",
    "And he sits on committees.\\n\\nThis is from a Telegram channel linked to Nick Fuentes.",
    "Ignore the left.”\nA sitting member of Congress fundraising with AFPAC.",
    "We will not let the left dictate our strategy, alliances and efforts.",
    "I’ll say this: there are millions of Gen Z, Y and X conservatives.",
    "Janice McGeachin and Arizona State Sen. Wendy Rogers.",
    "Gosar tweeted, “Not sure why anyone is freaking out.",
    "Gosar's speaking at CPAC in a couple hours.",
    "They will not agree 100% on every issue.",
    "Gosar was also featured at AFPAC 2021.",
    "That\\u2019s where we are.",
    "They believe in America.",
    "No group does."
