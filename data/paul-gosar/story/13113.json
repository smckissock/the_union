    "Romney said he doesn’t know Greene or Gosar but was reminded of a line from “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” where one character says, “‘Morons, I’ve got morons on my team.’ And I have to think that anybody that would sit down with white nationalists and speak at the conference was certainly missing a few IQ points.”\nAsked further about the pro-Putin wing of the Republican Party, Romney said many of them are “changing their stripes” as they see the response of the world and the political response in the U.S.\n“But how anybody, how anybody in this country which loves freedom could side with Vladimir Putin — which is an oppressor, a dictator, he kills people, he imprisons his political opponents, he has been an adversary of America at every chance he’s had — it’s unthinkable to me, it’s almost treasonous and it just make me ill to see some of these people do that,” Romney said.",
    "Calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “world hero” for his efforts to defend his country, Sen. Mitt Romney on Sunday denounced Vladimir Putin as “small, feral-eyed” man and referred to fellow Republicans who attended a conference where the Russian leader was cheered as “morons.”\nAppearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the Utah Republican said the “extraordinary” courage of the Ukrainian people has galvanized the spirit of the entire world, attributing much of it to “real leadership.”\n“You’ve seen both physical and moral leadership by Zelenskyy and the people around him,” Romney said.",
    "During the call, Zelenskyy told Trump that Ukraine was ready to buy more anti-tank missiles from the U.S. To which, Trump replied, “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,” referring to an investigation he wanted of then-Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden.",

Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., spoke at the event via video link, and Idaho Republican Lt. Gov.",
    "“The contrast between that and the puny nature of Vladimir Putin’s tyranny has really helped people understand the difference between good and evil.”\nRomney called it one of the “greatest demonstrations of good versus evil that we’ve seen during our lifetimes.”\n“Look at Vladimir Putin.",
    "This is remarkable, and it’s having an impact.”\nI join the world in awe of true heroes: the courageous President Zelensky, the brave Ukrainian soldiers, the citizen armies, the mothers cradling frightened children, and the journalists risking their lives to bring us truth.",
    "But, he said, given the passion, energy and leadership in Ukraine, “I wouldn’t count them out in being able to reject Russia’s aggression.”\nThe Russian government is a pariah, and the world is finally seeing Putin for what he really is: a small, evil, feral-eyed man.",

    "Romney said he hopes and believes Putin may recognize that he made a huge error, that he has badly miscalculated how hard the people of Ukraine would fight and the nature of the world’s response.",
    "As Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep Paul Gosar speak at this white supremacist, anti-Semitic, pro-Putin event, silence by Republican Party leaders is deafening and enabling.",
    "It looks like a mausoleum where honesty and honor have gone to die,” he said “Contrast that with Zelenskyy, with his courage, his passion, with his true leadership.",
    "Romney also criticized Trump’s now infamous 2019 phone call with Zelenskyy that led to his impeachment as a “very sad and awful” exchange on Trump’s part.",
    "pic.twitter.com/6fgpV6ohZ8\n— Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) February 26, 2022\nAsked on CNN about Cheney’s response, Romney said he “absolutely” agrees.",
    "It was a mistake to continue the policy of prior administrations to not provide Ukraine with the defensive weapons it needs, he said.",
    "Romney said the Biden administration has done some things well and some not so well in its response to Russia’s war on Ukraine.",

    "The late Arizona Sen. John McCain, he said, looked into Putin’s eyes and saw the KGB.",
