    "“In its latest attempt to keep track of all law-abiding gun-owners and implement its unconstitutional gun control agenda, the Biden administration has ordered the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) create a gun owner database of almost a billion searchable records, prohibited by current federal law.",
    "My No Gun Lists Act would require the ATF to immediately eliminate their illegal firearm record repository system, prohibit the relisting of records, and allow gun owners to sue the ATF for damages and injunctive relief,” said Congressman Paul Gosar.",
    "After all, even if you opt not to exercise your Second Amendment rights, you shouldn’t be fine with the government keeping a list of your neighbors who have decided otherwise.",
    "In just the past year, the ATF has stockpiled the records of over 54 million legal gun owners according to a troubling document first reported by the Washington Free Beacon.",
    "The ATF is violating existing federal law regarding record keeping and there is concern that passing another law prohibiting record keeping will not stop the ATF.",
    "Well, for one thing, it’s a signal that we’re not going to stop fighting for our gun rights just because Democrats have control of Congress and the White House.",
    "While I’d love to see it become law, I really don’t think we’re going to see that and, even if we do, there’s little reason to believe it’ll change anything.",
    "(AZ-04) issued the following statement after introducing the No Gun Lists Act, legislation endorsed by Gun Owners of America.",
    "Even after the midterms, should Republicans gain control of both chambers, it would require the president’s signature.",
    "It also helps to call attention to the illegal actions of the ATF in trying to create what amounts to a gun registry.",
    "The truth of the matter is that a lot of people aren’t really aware that what the ATF is doing violates federal law.",
    "I expect they’ll do what they’ve been doing and then pretend any such new law had no real meaning to speak of.",
    "Right now, Democrats control the House, which means this isn’t even making it out of committee.",
    "However, Rep. Paul Gosar has now introduced a bill seeking to ban Uncle Sam from doing so.",
    "Does anyone in their right mind really expect Biden to do anything but veto such a bill?",
    "Why would we assume they’d suddenly decided they were in the wrong?",
    "Gun lists, or lists of gun owners, should concern every American.",
    "But, the truth is that this bill is a statement and little else.",
    "It shouldn’t be like that, of course, but it is what it is.",
    "As noted, the ATF is already breaking the law.",
    "One would imagine that would include the ATF.",
    "So why is this bill even being introduced?",
    "I’d absolutely love to see this happen.",
    "And yet, a lot of people want them.",
    "Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S.",
    "Such is life in Biden’s America.",
    "Yeah, that’s what I thought.",
    "It’s just too bad it won’t.",
    "The truth is, I don’t."
