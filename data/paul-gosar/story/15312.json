    "The bill subsidizes the Biden administration’s radical green energy policies and increases the annual budget for the Internal Revenue Service by a whopping $12.6 billion just so they can further harass taxpayers.",
    "But with no time allowed to review the entirety, and no amendments or debate allowed, I am precluded from fighting for the good part of this bill while getting the nonsense cut.",
    "It also includes over $4 billion in earmarks chosen by Democrats but not allowed for Republicans, and it includes funds for the murderous Planned Parenthood.",
    "Less than a day has been made available for any member to “read” this bill, and it is physically impossible to do so in the time allotted.",
    "Congress should be looking at ways to reduce spending rather than add to our $30 trillion national debt and advancing Leftist policies.",
    "No one, literally not one single member of congress has read through the entirety of this enormous legislation before voting for it.",
    "For that reason, I am left with no real choice but to vote against this bill as currently presented,” concluded Congressman Gosar.",
    "We are more than five months into Fiscal Year 2022 and the liberals who run Congress still cannot get their act together.",
    "This spending package increases non-defense discretionary spending by 7% and finances it with more deficit spending.",

    "(AZ-04) issued the following statement after voting against H.R.",
    "There have been no hearings, markups or robust debates.",
    "There are dozens of programs I support in this bill.",
