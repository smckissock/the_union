    "Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema were traitors who stood in the way of a different bill that was never described in any way except as a price tag.",
    "The legislation will begin the important process of mitigating the effects of climate change by building dikes, dams and other infrastructure.",
    "When voters are dissatisfied with the state of things, they punish the party in power, and Democrats seem poised for a thumping.",
    "I also recall the Obama campaign commercial that falsely pinned responsibility for a woman's cancer death on Mitt Romney's firm.",
