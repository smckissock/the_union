    "According to an article in Mother Jones, the 12-page document, produced by Russian security’s Department of Information and Telecommunications Support, reads in part, “It is essential to use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who sharply criticizes the actions of the United States [and] NATO … .”\nCarlson has long been a Putin propagandist\nThis isn’t new.",
    "And while every TV personality I’m aware of craves attention, I can’t imagine that Carlson or his bosses at Fox feel particularly proud of the fact that Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin has issued a memo to state-controlled media urging them to play more clips of Carlson making excuses for the Russian dictator’s brutal and criminal attack on Ukraine.",
    "In the months before the Russian aggression began, long before an attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol or on civilian enclaves in various cities, Carlson served essentially as an enthusiastic Putin supporter and propogandist, heaping praise and making excuses for a man the late-Sen. John McCain called a thug and a murderer.",
    "As Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said, “I have morons on my team.”\nBut to see how Putin is using Carlson as a propaganda tool, and then to see footage of a Russian mortar strike killing a young Ukrainian family trying to escape the violence … well …\n... it makes me sick.",

    "We're witnessing a nauseating reality\nAnd I suppose what he says has appeal among those individuals referred to by Republican Rep. Liz Cheney as the “Putin wing” of the GOP.",
    "Meantime, Russia loves the fact that Fox’s Carlson called Russia’s brutal attack a “border dispute.” That he called Ukraine a “puppet” of the West.",
    "And the former FSB officer and critic Alexander Litvinenko, killed by green tea laced with radioactive polonium, dying three weeks later.",
    "Luckily for him, he lives in a free country, unlike his counterparts in the media outlets that were shut down in Russia.",
    "Most recently there is Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been jailed after having survived a poisoning.",
    "There was the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, first poisoned, from which she survived, then later gunned down.",
    "Opinion: Vladimir Putin's security team urges state-controlled media to play more clips of Carlson.",
    "As would Georgia’s just-as-nutty Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.)",
