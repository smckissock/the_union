    "Rogers called heroic Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is standing firm against Russian aggression, “a globalist puppet for Soros and the Clintons.”\nRogers also expressed love and support for conference organizer Nick Fuentes, who called the United States “the evil empire of the world” and who added, “Now, they’re going and saying, ‘Vladimir Putin is Adolf Hitler,’ as if that isn’t a good thing.”\nThe Arizona Senate on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to censure Rogers.",

    "Opinion: Republicans condemn hate speech, bigotry and antisemitism, but those who preach it remain in office and in the GOP.",
    "There most definitely IS a place in the GOP those who hold such beliefs, or they would not have been elected to office.",
    "Liz and I can get censured, they’re going to get help up as the future leaders of the party.”\nExactly.",
