    "\"No Member of Congress exercising their authority to control the 'power of the purse' under Article I of the Constitution of the United States should vote to fund an Executive Branch that is requiring unconstitutional vaccine mandates on American citizens in the private sector, or foolishly and wrongheadedly mandating the COVID-19 vaccination of government personnel,\" the group said at the time.",
    "\"We request Republican leadership focus not on 'parity' of increased government spending and rushed legislation to 'avoid a shutdown,' but rather take specific action to change the direction of this country on these important issues, among others, by using the power of the purse granted to us in Article 1 of the Constitution,\" the letter reads.",
    "However, the House Freedom Caucus — a group of the most far-right members of the House, including Reps.

    "Democrats, for their part, are close to finalizing a government spending deal that includes aid to Ukraine as well as COVID-19 relief, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a letter to senators on Monday.",
    "If the Freedom Caucus convinces enough Republicans not to support a funding bill with Ukraine aid and COVID-19 relief funds and it doesn't pass, the federal government would shut down on March 12.",
    "Congress, however, went on to pass a short-term funding deal, keeping the government open but punting the full government funding debate to this year.",
