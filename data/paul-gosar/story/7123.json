    "— Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) March 29, 2022\nRELATED: Rep. Matt Gaetz Enters Hunter Biden’s Laptop Hard Drive Into The Congressional Record During Hearing\nGaetz Introduces ‘Spook Who Cried Wolf Resolution’ Resolution\nRight before the 2020 presidential election, 51 former intelligence officials signed and published a letter meant to shut down any discussion of the veracity of Hunter Biden’s laptop by suggesting it was “Russian disinformation.”\nGaetz’s new “Spook Who Cried Wolf Resolution” is aimed the officials – which is a “who’s who” of American spies and intelligence officials.",
    "There is no greater ethical concern or frankly conspiracy … whether this president is compromised because of his illegal ties to his family members.”\nThe open question is what should be done about the media, that walked hand-in-hand with intelligence officials in immediately dismissing the Hunter Biden laptop as “Russian disinformation” on the eve of a Presidential election, rather than actually investigating the matter and doing their jobs.",
    "On Tuesday, America First Congressman Matt Gaetz introduced a resolution that would strip security clearances from the 51 intelligence officials who signed on to a letter meant to sew doubt about the Hunter Biden laptop story, insinuating it was “Russian disinformation.”\nGaetz has been on a tear – having just entered the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop into the Congressional Record during a cybersecurity hearing Tuesday.",
    "The Republican’s proposal reads, “The 51 signatories of the letter who publicly and falsely decried Hunter Biden’s laptop to be Russian disinformation should be barred from holding any level of security clearances indefinitely.”\nGaetz’s resolution is co-sponsored so far by fellow Republican Reps. Thomas Massie, Dan Bishop, Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar, Louie Gohmert, and Marjorie Taylor Greene.",
    "BREAKING: Today I will be introducing the “Spook Who Cried Wolf Resolution” to indefinitely bar security clearances for 51 intelligence officials who publicly lied and labeled the real contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation.",
    "Signatories of the letter include former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director Mike Hayden, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, former CIA Director John Brennan, and more.",
    "The Political Insider noted previously that Hunter Biden could be called before Congress if Republicans are successful in the 2022 midterms.",
