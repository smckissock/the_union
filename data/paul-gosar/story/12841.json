    "â€” Adam Kinzinger (@Adam Kinzinger) 1646255322\nSupport for Ukraine was a major part of President Joe Biden's State of the Union Address on Tuesday, and he outlined how the United States and its allies have leveled crippling economic sanctions against Russia while also providing the country with weapons and intelligence aimed at fending off the Russian invaders.",
    "Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) expressed astonishment on Wednesday after three of his fellow House Republicans voted against a resolution expressing support for the Ukrainian people as they face an invasion from the Russian military.",
    "Although the resolution passed by an overwhelming majority, three House Republicans voted against it: Reps. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Thomas Massie (R-KY), and Matt Rosendale (R-MT).",
    "Kinzinger earlier this year was censured by the Republican National Committee for his work on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th Capitol riots.",
    "He was also one of only ten House Republicans who voted in favor of former President Donald Trump's second impeachment.",
    "\"Unreal,\" Kinzinger commented on Twitter.",
    "\"The bright side is over 400 voted yes.\""
