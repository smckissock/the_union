    "Over a scary screenshot of Vice President Kamala Harris, Strahan denounces “out of control inflation” and a \"crisis at the border.” There’s footage of President Joe Biden honoring fallen soldiers at Dover Air Force Base, which Strahan grossly calls a “harsh reminder that this is not the time for unserious politicians who just want to hear themselves talk.” Maybe she’s talking about Greene again, but if so, she’s missing the plot.",
    "The Republican Jewish Committee condemned Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar for appearing at the Klan bake in “the strongest possible terms,” and Greene’s GOP primary challenger Jennifer Strahan agreed that her \"behavior has no place in the GOP.” If this is how you learned Greene has a primary challenger, don’t feel bad.",
    "Strahan is eager to join the new GOP House majority, which she says “must do very serious work” (there’s that word again) defending Donald Trump’s policies and holding the “Biden/Harris administration and the radical left accountable for their failures.”\nBut Trump has no real policies beyond white nationalism.",

    "GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene spoke at a white nationalist event last weekend, which was embarrassing for Republicans who prefer to keep the white hoods on the downlow.",
    "STRAHAN: I’m Jennifer Strahan, a small business owner, a Christian, a wife, and a mother to a rambunctious little boy ... and two dogs and a tortoise.",
    "She goes on to say she’s not a politician or a celebrity, and says, “quite frankly, I don’t want to be either.” Bold move for an aspiring politician.",
    "Select an amount (USD)\n$2$25$5$50$10$100$15$500$20$1000\nStephen Robinson\nStephen Robinson is a writer and social kibbitzer based in Portland, Oregon.",
    "You either go full Adam Kinzinger/Liz Cheney and repudiate Trump and everything he stands for, or you’re an insurrection-tolerant MAGA stooge.",
    "Polls shows that if a Republican has any shot of defeating Greene, they’ll need crossover support from Democrats in the open primary.",
    "Here’s her campaign launch ad, where Strahan offers a boilerplate “Democrats are bad” message that might’ve resonated more in 2002.",
    "We’d love to see Greene lose her seat but it’s hard to get excited about replacing her with another Elise Stefanik or Nancy Mace.",
    "Strahan is only 36, and it’s damn weird when people who are that young whine about how \"our culture has gotten off track.\"",

    "No one has demonized and attacked Biden and Harris more than Greene, who’s called for their impeachment.",
    "If they were playing “Hey Ya” at your high school prom, you can probably cope with the modern world.",
