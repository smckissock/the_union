    "You may remember last month I shared a story on how the Center for Disease Control (CDC) withheld valuable data on hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in the United States broken down by age, race, and vaccination status, a failure that critics say worsened the pandemic response.",
    "The CDC then used the inaccurate data to push their unscientific mask mandates, recommending that all children under the age of two should be masked and claiming that schools without mask mandates have triple the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks.",
    "For one, health policies were made by states and the federal government based of the CDC’s erroneous data.",
    "This week, the CDC admitted they overcounted pediatric COVID-19 deaths by nearly 25%.",
    "The CDC and Dr. Fauci have been lying to the American people for two years.",
    "They claim the mistake was caused by a “coding error.”\nWhy is this bad?",
    "But I am not surprised, nor should you be.",
    "And there will be many, many more.",
    "They just make this garbage up.",
    "Well, the deception continues.",
    "More lies."
