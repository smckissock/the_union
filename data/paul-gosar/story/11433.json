    "The SPLC defines this sector, which includes militias and groups like the Oath Keepers, as an “antidemocratic hard-right movement,” adding that these groups “believe the federal government is tyrannical, and they traffic in conspiracy theories about an illegitimate government of leftist elites seeking a ‘New World Order.’” Others who monitor the far right refer to these groups as the Patriot and/or militia movement.",
    "A newly released annual census of these groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), “The Year in Hate and Extremism 2021,” which quantifies the far right’s ideological trends, shows that even as most in-person far right groups have declined, the violent Proud Boys group has grown, and new online forms of far right organizing have spread.",

    "Numbers of anti-government groups stayed fairly high under Trump, although they slumped every year (from 689 in 2017, to 566 in 2020).",
    "Even to casual observers, it’s clear that white supremacist groups and their cousins, the militias, have been in full swing for years.",
    "(If it were, the numbers of neo-Nazi groups would be significantly higher, changing our perspective on the momentum of this movement.)",
    "While this growth seems counterintuitive after more than 40 members were arrested for the Capitol takeover, it is not unheard of.",
