    "During an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union\", with host Dana Bash, normally unflappable Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) launched into a brutal assessment of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) for speaking at a white nationalist convention, calling the controversial House member a \"moron.\"",
    "Asked by host Bash about Taylor Greene's appearance at the racist get-together in Orlando along with Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) the Utah Republican didn't mince words when host Bash quoted a statement made by Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) that attacked the Georgia lawmaker.",
    "I also saw that [RNC head] Ronna McDaniel came out with a statement as well talking about how repugnant these white nationalists are.",
    "I'm reminded of the old line from the Butch Cassidy movie where one character says, 'Morons, I have morons on my team.'",
    "I think anybody who would sit down with white nationalists at their conference is certainly missing a few IQ points.\"",
    "There's no place in either political party for this white nationalism or racism -- it's simply wrong.\"",
    "\"Liz Cheney was right with that statement and has been right for a long time,\" Romney shot back. \"",
    "\"As you've indicated, speaking of evil, it's evil as well,\" he continued.",
    "\"Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar ...",
    "I don't know them.",
