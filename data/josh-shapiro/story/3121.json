    "The battle will continue, however â€” the decision will almost certainly be appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, notes the Inquirer, \"triggering an automatic stay of that decision and leaving Act 77 in place while the high court considers the case.\"",
    "In its 3-2 decision on Friday, the Republican-leaning state court ruled the legislature \"could not make changes to voting laws without amending the constitution,\" per the Times.",
    "\"This opinion is based on twisted logic and faulty reasoning, and is wrong on the law,\" said state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, per Politico.",

    "\"The issue will now go before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and we are confident that Act 77 will ultimately be upheld as constitutional.\"",
    "Though the bipartisan 2019 law was heralded when it was passed, \"it became a target of conservatives during the 2020 election.\"",
    "Tom Wolf (D) in 2019, allowed for \"no-excuse absentee voting,\" among other things, writes The New York Times.",
    "The law, known as Act 77 and passed by state Gov."
