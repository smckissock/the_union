    "FRANKLIN COUNTY, Pa. (WHTM) – Franklin County District Attorney Matthew Fogal says his office is declining to prosecute Pennsylvania State Senator and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano for alleged campaign finance fraud after questions were raised by another Republican candidate for Governor, Jake Corman\nFogal says his office was notified of a letter drafted by the Pittsburgh law firm of Chalmers & Childs LLC, on behalf of its client, “Corman for Governor,” alleging Mastriano illegally filed campaign finance reports.",
    "But this is not perjury.”\nMatthew Fogal, Franklin County District Attorney\nFogal’s letter went on to further call the request to investigate Mastriano “frivolous,” “shameful,” and a “political stunt.” He went on to say that while there may not be a case for perjury, “that is not to say there may not be consequence.”\nFogal’s three-page response to the allegations can be read below:\nWHTM has reached out to the Corman and Mastriano campaigns for comment on Fogal’s letter.",
    "A letter drafted by the lawyers for “Corman for Governor” alleged Mastriano’s updated filing constitutes perjury, claiming “submitting a false campaign finance report “constitute[s] the crime of perjury” under Pennsylvania law.”\nThe drafted letter can be read below:\nOn Wednesday Corman’s campaign Twitter account retweeted a Philadelphia Inquirer story on Mastriano’s filing.",
    "In a statement released on Tuesday, the committee alleged Mastriano “was part of a plan to arrange for an “alternate” slate of electors from Pennsylvania for former President Trump and reportedly spoke with President Trump about post-election activities.”\nMastriano has not responded to requests for comments on the subpoena.",
    "Corman’s attorneys alleged that Mastriano “failed to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign activities.”\nMastriano filed an updated campaign finance statement on Tuesday showing he had almost twice as much campaign cash as he initially reported.",
    "In ordinary times, such conduct would be appropriately addressed in our free press, which this has, and potential voters would be able to exercise their critical thought as to whether this type of conduct inspires confidence in a candidate’s fitness.",
    "The updated statement puts Mastriano among the biggest-raising candidates in a double-digits-deep Republican primary field competing for the nomination to challenge the presumed Democratic nominee, two-term state Attorney General Josh Shapiro.",
    "Jake Corman’s campaign issued the following statement on Friday night:\n“There is a very clear campaign finance violation here, and we followed the law for reporting it to the appropriate authorities.",
    "The law matters.”\nJake Corman campaign\nMastriano was officially subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee last week over his alleged efforts to falsely declare Donald Trump the winner of the 2020 election.",
    "Fogal released a letter Friday night to the media saying he will “not be further dragged into a rancid, internecine affray amongst unserious and fanatical contestants for Governor.",
    "Mastriano is now reporting that he had slightly over $1 million in his campaign account heading into 2022, instead of the $550,000 he initially reported.",
    "Mastriano filed an initial Campaign Finance Report and then filed another one, and there were discrepancies between the two filings.",
    "Voters in Pennsylvania deserve to know that their candidates for governor are transparent and comply with the law.",
    "Everyone in this race is following our campaign finance laws except for one candidate.",
    "This is not perjury, as has been suggested to me by Corman for Governor.",
    "Maybe it does or maybe it does not, and reasonable people may disagree.",
    "Corman’s tweet consisted of one emoji of a spool of thread.",
    "That is not to say there may not be consequence.",
    "The Associated Press contributed to this report",
    "“\n“Mr."
