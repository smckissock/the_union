    "Pennsylvania Democrat attorney general Josh Shapiro, who is now running for Governor of Pennsylvania, stands accused of covering up election fraud complaints against Democrats dating back years during his current tenure as attorney general, leading a whistleblower to accuse Shapiro of being “criminally negligent.”\n“AG Shapiro turned a blind eye to the alleged criminal wrongdoing of members of the Democrat Party in our county (Fayette County, Pennsylvania).",
    "As Mahoney then sat on the House Appropriations Committee, and as the PA budget must by law be completed by July 1, the per diem records showed that Mahoney was reimbursed for overnight stays in Harrisburg (200-plus miles away from Fayette County).",
    "They hosted him recently,” whistleblower Robert Frasconi told NATIONAL FILE, noting that he made a formal 2018 complaint directly to Shapiro “after the numerous contacts to his subordinates went unanswered.”\nRobert Frasconi told NATIONAL FILE: “1.",
    "My colleague, Delinda Young, and I went through two election boards, two district attorneys, and three AGs (including Josh Shapiro) to no avail as they all covered for Mahoney.” more",
    "We later came to learn of Mahoney’s election fraud — he altered and falsified affidavits of circulator and signed as the sole affiant, as if he solely circulated the petitions.",
    "Thus, Mahoney could not be in Harrisburg and before 50 continuously circulating referendum petitions as he attested on his altered and falsified affidavits of circulator.",
    "Interestingly, we made open records requests for Mahoney’s per diem records during his purported circulation period of his referendum petitions June 1 – Aug. 8, 2011.",
    "A case of alleged election fraud involving a former Democrat state representative who served 10 years as state representative in the 51st Legislative District.",
    "Thus, I and my colleague, Delinda Young, challenged Mahoney’s referendum petition in the local PA Court of Common Pleas.",
    "Timothy S. Mahoney was elected alongside Josh Shapiro after the middle-of-the-night pay raise scandal of July 2005.",
    "He also perjured himself in the courtroom as he lied about the circulation period for his referendum petitions.",
    "These same Democrats now owe gubernatorial candidate Shapiro their support in his run for the governorship.",
    "In short, the proof of Mahoney’s election fraud is incontrovertible and irrefutable.",
    "Mahoney receives credit for pushing for the PA’s so-called Open Records law.",
    "Mahoney pushed for a countywide referendum on school consolidation in 2011.",
    "Shapiro and Mahoney served together on the House Reform Committee.",
    "We prevailed, and Mahoney’s referendum petition was struck.",
    "Pennsylvania law does not permit advisory referenda.",
    "They are friends."
