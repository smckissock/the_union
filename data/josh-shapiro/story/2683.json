    "\"A truly transparent and comprehensive assessment would not have evaded the questions raised by public records, especially and including whether the University of Pittsburgh used the body parts of babies who were born alive and died from having their organs harvested, as well as if individuals procuring the baby body parts for the university altered abortion procedures to suit their gruesome research,\" added Smith, who chairs the House Pro-Life Caucus.",
    "Pitt has long denied any wrongdoing and maintained its researchers didn't participate in medical procedures related to tissue collection for the GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy Project (GUDMAP) program, which sought to \"develop a pipeline to the acquisition, quality control and distribution of human genitourinary [urinary and genital organs and functions] samples obtained throughout development (6-42 weeks gestation).\"",
    "\"UPMC is a private, nonprofit corporation that operates hospitals and employs physicians, residents and fellows … Pitt has no role in managing or supervising the provision of medical services by UPMC personnel; therefore, our review did not include the activities conducted by individuals acting in their capacity as a UPMC employee.\"",
    "TESTIMONY FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD, TISSUE PROCURER SHEDS LIGHT ON BABIES BORN ALIVE, WITH BEATING HEARTS\nCenter for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden, along with watchdog group Judicial Watch, brought national attention to the university's GUDMAP research, which identified the Pitt biospecimen core as the source of its tissue.",
    "DOCTORS SAY PITT STATEMENTS POINT TO POSSIBILITY ORGANS EXTRACTED FROM LIVE FETUSES; SCHOOL DENIES CHARGE\nMihalek told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that an investigation \"cannot and should not merely be a test of whether or not the university complied with the state and federal requirements.\"",
    "UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH ACCUSED OF ‘LOWERING THE CONE OF SILENCE’ WITH NEW FETAL TISSUE PROBE\nSmith's comments echoed previous concerns that the investigation – conducted by D.C.-based firm Hyman, Phelps and McNamara (HPM) – wouldn't probe the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).",
    "MILLIONS IN FEDERAL MONEY FLOWED TO TISSUE BANK THAT COLLECTED FETAL ‘HEART, GONADS, LEGS, BRAIN’: REPORT\nIt remains unclear, however, why Pitt commented on tissue collection and said in its National Institutes of Health (NIH) application that it was able to minimize ischemia time.",
    "Asked about the ischemia reference, David Seldin, the university's assistant vice chancellor for news, previously told Fox News Digital: \"In this case, ischemia time refers to the time after the tissue collection procedure and before cooling for storage and transport.\"",
    "\"This error does not alter the substantive content of the report or its conclusions: the Pitt IRB [Institutional Review Board] reviewed the study protocols for both these studies and appropriately determined they were compliant with federal and state law.\"",
    "\"This investigation was clearly an attempt by the university to obfuscate and gloss over the barbaric reality of UPMC fetal tissue research projects,\" Herb Geraghty, a Pittsburgh resident and head of Rehumanize International, told Fox News Digital.",
    "Both state Rep. Natalie Mihalek, R-Upper St. Clair, and Carla Sands, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate and former ambassador to Denmark, expressed concerns about the moral issues involved and indicated meeting legal thresholds wasn't enough.",
    "\"It’s clear the firm which conducted this review, which already had potential conflict-of-interest issues, relied heavily on the University of Pittsburgh’s word and simplistic ‘understanding’ that fetal tissue was properly used,\" Kelly said.",
    "\"This review is now complete and confirms that the University to Pittsburgh’s activities ‘related to the procurement, disbursement and use of human fetal tissue in research are fully compliant with applicable laws,'\" the statement said.",
    "Moreover, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have not responded to a letter I led with more than 50 of my colleagues in Congress requesting further transparency into the matter.",
    "\"The discussion on page 22 should not have cited to the study that was published in Scientific Reports; rather, the citation should have been to the other study conducted by the researcher, which did source tissue from ABR.",
    "\"[W]e did not review the clinical decision-making or delivery of medical care, such as abortion, by individuals serving in their capacity as University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) employees,\" the report stated.",
    "The law firm's report, released last month, said that \"our findings confirm that the university’s activities in support of research involving human fetal tissue are conducted in compliance with federal and state laws.\"",
    "The recent investigation into the University of Pittsburgh wasn't nearly enough to address allegations of illegal and unethical activities surrounding its fetal tissue research, multiple GOP politicians have indicated.",
    "The firm also noted \"ambiguity in the signature field of consent forms [for fetal tissue donation] that has led to errors by the healthcare professional describing their role in the tissue collection process.\"",
    "Pitt has said that its fetal tissue comes from UPMC, and many — including nearly 100 members of Congress — have raised questions about the nature of abortions that yielded tissue for the university.",
    "Seldin's comments prompted numerous physicians to say he was essentially acknowledging fetuses were alive during organ extraction – something Seldin and the university have vehemently denied.",

    "Tom Wolf, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., and Rep. Dwight Evans, D-Pa., did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.",
    "HPM's report notes appear to contradict what the university previously said about the source of tissue used for an experiment involving fetal scalps grafted onto rodents.",
    "\"It is long past time for the federal HHS Office of Inspector General to conduct a full audit to determine whether infanticide or other misconduct is occurring.\"",
    "Kelly's conflict of interest accusation seemed to be referring to HPM attorney Michael Heeters, a Pitt alum who graduated from the school of pharmacy in 2004.",
    "We plan to continue organizing and mobilizing students, alumni and community members to demand justice for the victims of this extreme violence.\"",
    "I continue to call on all parties to provide detailed answers into our inquiries and to shine a true light on this incredibly important issue.\"",
    "While the scientific paper said the tissue came from the Pitt biospecimen core, HPM's report said it came from Advanced Biosciences Resources.",
    "Pitt itself has acknowledged that UPMC provides tissue for its biospecimen core and houses several of the tissue bank's locations.",
    "\"In our report, we inadvertently reversed references to two studies conducted by the same researcher,\" said attorney Anne Walsh.",
    "In its report, HPM said it was the firm's \"understanding that no fetal tissue is collected from abortions performed at [PPWP].\"",
    "\"The University of Pittsburgh’s investigation is a whitewash,\" Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., told Fox News Digital in a statement.",
    "It's unclear why she supported the probe with its limited scope or knew about that limit prior to HPM releasing its report.",
    "Not one dime of our tax dollars should go to this research, and those conducting this research should be held accountable.\"",
    "On Tuesday, HPM sent Fox News Digital a statement saying it had inadvertently mismatched references in its report.",
