    "This is going to be a great news item for Doug’s supporters, as they take a break from waiting for the latest “Q Drop.”\nAll of Mastriano’s dodging and weaving came to a head during the last week of December when Breitbart.com, the go-to conservative news website, called him out on this questionable campaign finance tactic of raising substantial amounts of money for a gubernatorial campaign without having organized an official and legal campaign finance committee to do so.",
    "His early lie about having Trump’s endorsement, his trip to view the Arizona vote audit which was paid for by a news organization, his taking money from the swamp and then pretending to be an outsider, his coming down on both sides of issues such as mail-in voting, and his trashing and defaming decades of scholarly research in order to promote and publish his book on Sergeant Alvin York may reveal someone who puts his personal ambition ahead of truth and transparency.",
    "If Doug Mastriano’s looking at state campaign finance laws with a wink and a nod was an isolated incident, we could write it off as a rookie mistake, but the troubling thing is that it seems to fit into a pattern of his playing loosey goosey with the rules, regardless of the game.",
    "Among announced candidates, four-term congressman and Trump supporter Lou Barletta has been the leader to date, but it has been an unannounced (well, sort of) candidate, 33rd District State Senator Doug Mastriano, who has shown a lot of strength, and this is where the fun begins.",
    "The next day, Mastriano went on “Newstalk 103.7 FM”, aka “Mastriano FM” and in a softball interview, blasted Breitbart and Ms. Bleau for the article, and according to a follow-up Breitbart article, he also made numerous misstatements in what was termed “a meltdown.\"",
    "Perhaps Mastriano’s fast and loose approach to campaign finance is a “gray area” as he maintains, but since his potential November opponent is State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the guy who enforces these laws, he’d better be sure of it.",
    "So far, the race for who will replace Democrat Tom Wolf as governor has attracted the most interest, at least on the Republican side, with about 14 or so primary election candidates either having announced or waiting in the wings.",
    "First, he was waiting for God, then he told us Donald Trump told him to run, a statement that was denied by Trump’s office within hours, and then it was if “the folks” wanted him to run, that, it seems, plus a million bucks.",
    "He has been an Amateur Radio Operator since 1988, getting his first license in Germany, and is a past volunteer with both Navy and Army MARS, Military Auxiliary Radio Service, and is also a certified firearms instructor.",
    "The stakes are high in Pennsylvania, with elections for both governor and U.S. senator on the table in addition to all the congressional races and those for all state representatives and half of our state senators.",
    "You see, although Mastriano is officially unannounced, he, with the help of several organizations and at least one media outlet, has been raising a ton of money, perhaps illegally, to make his run.",
    "The 103.7 announcers who interviewed Mastriano were beyond sympathetic to him, even taking shots at other Republican candidates Jake Corman and Lou Barletta.",
    "He has been in leadership roles for the Republican Party in two states, most recently serving two terms as Chairman of the Franklin County Republican Party.",
    "Doug’s Br’er Rabbit “Please don’t throw me in the briar patch” schtick seems to have worked, because his official announcement is forthcoming.",
    "He is retired from the United States Department of Defense, where his career included assignments In Europe, Asia and Central America.",
    "The initial Breitbart article, dated Dec. 28 and by Hannah Bleau, spelled out these concerns in detail with corroborating evidence.",
    "At this point, it is useless to look at polls, because those few that are out there show the big frontrunner as “undecided.\"",
    "Guest columnist\n2022 has arrived, and with it, the important mid-term election cycle begins.",
    "Involved in web publishing since 1996, he is the publisher of The Franklin County Journal.",
    "Better yet, Republican primary voters need to pick a clean candidate for governor in May.",
    "Dwight Weidman is a resident of Greene Township and is a graduate of Shepherd University.",
    "The Democrats seem set on their candidate, current PA Attorney General Josh Shapiro.",
    "Of course, he has solidly maintained that it wasn’t really his decision to be made.",
    "The Republican race is going to be fascinating to watch."
