    "Mr. Shapiro did not mention which groups might challenge the ruling, but said arguments against it were “reckless and irresponsible,” and “would not be common sense.”\nMr. Shapiro said he has been sounding the alarm over ghost guns for the past three years, and has previously urged the Pennsylvania Legislature to pass legislation to close legal loopholes that allows the kits to be sold without background checks and remain without serial numbers.",
    "“I’m pleased that after inaction by legislative leadership in Harrisburg, and inaction in the congress of the United States, that finally the President has acted and is doing something to keep our law enforcement safe and reduce violence in our communities.”\nThe ruling goes into effect in 120 days from its publication in the Federal Register, according to the DOJ.",
    "“I’m hopeful these rules will go into effect as quickly as possible.”\nThe ruling delivered by the Department of Justice cracks down on ghost guns as violent shootings surge in cities across the country, with the use of the self-assembled guns increasing tenfold from 2016 to 2020, according to gun violence prevention group CeaseFirePA.",
    "Hours after the Biden administration announced measures to make “ghost guns” — home-assembled firearms without serial numbers — harder for felons to access, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro told media he was prepared to handle legal challenges to the ruling.",
    "Additionally, the ruling clarifies the definition of a firearm, requiring the frames of ghost guns to be given serial numbers that would make it easier for law enforcement agencies to trace them.",
    "The “Frame or Receiver” rule spent at least a year in the DOJ before being announced on Monday, and requires retailers to issue background checks for the kits sold to assemble the weapons.",
    "“Certainty, we’ll be prepared to deal with any litigation that comes — we’ll be on the front lines of that,” said Mr. Shapiro, who attended the announcement at the White House on Monday.",
    "It’s too easy for them to get — here in Pennsylvania, and really across the nation.”\nFirst Published April 11, 2022, 7:42pm",
    "“It’s necessary now more than ever,” Mr. Shapiro continued.",
    "“Ghost guns have become the weapon of choice for criminals."
