    "| Mark Makela/Getty Images\nBy Zach Montellaro\n 01/28/2022 10:18 AM EST\nUpdated: 01/28/2022 11:25 AM EST\nA Pennsylvania state court on Friday struck down the law allowing any voter to cast a ballot by mail, handing a victory to Republican lawmakers who sought to curtail the practice amid former President Donald Trump’s attacks on mail voting.",
    "The practice once enjoyed broad bipartisan backing, but Republican support for the practice plummeted in 2020, as Trump attacked mail voting in the run-up to the election and then blamed it for his loss after, spreading conspiracy theories about widespread fraud within the practice.",
    "“The issue will now go before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and we are confident that Act 77 will ultimately be upheld as constitutional.”\nAn appeal would automatically trigger a stay of the lower court’s ruling.",
    "But a constitutional amendment must be presented to the people and adopted into our fundamental law before legislation authorizing no-excuse mail-in voting can ‘be placed upon our statute books,’” she continued.",
    "The ruling came out of a consolidated lawsuit, including a challenge brought by more than a dozen Republican lawmakers in the state — some of whom initially voted for the expansion of mail voting in 2019.",
    "State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat, said the ruling would be appealed to the state Supreme Court, which turned back other challenges to the law in 2020 and has a generally liberal bent.",
    "Absentee voting in Pennsylvania is similar to mail voting and has existed for years, but voters need a valid excuse — like an illness or being out of the area on Election Day — to use it.",
    "A panel of judges from Pennsylvania’s commonwealth court ruled that Act 77 — which passed out of the state legislature with bipartisan support and was signed by Democratic Gov.",
    "Approximately 1.38 million voters have expressed their interest in voting by mail permanently,” wrote commonwealth court judge Mary Hannah Leavitt, who authored the ruling.",
    "“Big news out of Pennsylvania, great patriotic spirit is developing at a level that nobody thought possible,” Trump said in a statement celebrating the Pennsylvania ruling.",
    "In Wisconsin, a lawsuit from a conservative organization banned the use of dropboxes in the state temporarily, before a higher court stayed that order earlier in January.",
    "“Make America Great Again!”\nOver 2.6 million Pennsylvanians voted via the mail in the 2020 general election, according to the state’s elections department.",
    "Since then, Republicans in battlegrounds and other states have sought to change voting rules via legislation or court challenges to restrict mail voting.",
    "“If presented to the people, a constitutional amendment to end the Article VII, Section 1 requirement of in-person voting is likely to be adopted.",
    "“No-excuse mail-in voting makes the exercise of the franchise more convenient and has been used four times in the history of Pennsylvania.",
    "“This opinion is based on twisted logic and faulty reasoning, and is wrong on the law,” he said in a statement.",
    "The ruling is the latest skirmish in a broader fight over mail voting happening in dozens of states.",
    "A voter casts her early voting ballot at drop box outside of City Hall in Philadelphia.",
    "Since then, Republicans across the country have targeted mail voting.",
    "That number includes both no-excuse mail voting and absentee voting.",
    "Absentee voting is unaffected by Friday’s court ruling.",
    "Tom Wolf in 2019 — violated the state constitution.",
    "Holly Otterbein contributed to this report."
