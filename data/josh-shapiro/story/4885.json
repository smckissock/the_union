    "However, if the court order is overturned on appeal, Wolf’s new regulations will raise the cost of electricity for every business and every Pennsylvanian at a time when we are experiencing the highest inflation in 40 years.",
    "Tom Wolf is again ignoring the Pennsylvania Constitution and exceeding his authority by issuing regulations that require utilities to pay a tax for the carbon dioxide they emit starting July 1, 2022.",
    "Only the Pennsylvania Legislature has the power to create new taxes or to enter the Commonwealth into interstate agreements, but this does not seem to matter to the wanna-to-be dictator!",
    "Wolf cited the global climate crisis as the reason for his latest overreach, and he vetoed a bipartisan bill making it clear that approval by the Pennsylvania Legislature was required.",
    "Wolf’s term as governor will end this year due to term limits, but his Attorney General, Democrat Josh Shapiro, will happily step into the role of a dictator if elected in November.",
    "Efforts to override Wolf’s veto will likely fall just short of the super-majority required because some Democrats in the legislature think the end justifies the means.",
    "Wolf has mostly been in hiding since voters neutered him with two new Constitutional amendments to expressly limit his Emergency Declaration powers.",
    "Wolf also plans to enter Pennsylvania into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).",
    "I hope the voters of Pennsylvania are smart enough to ensure that doesn’t happen!",
    "Just as he abused his Emergency Declaration powers during COVID-19, Gov.",
    "A court order is currently blocking Wolf’s new carbon tax.",
    "This latest overreach may be Wolf’s last grasp for power.",
    "His regulations will also cost jobs and hurt our economy.",
    "Both actions are blatantly unconstitutional!",
