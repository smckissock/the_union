    "But with Thomas’ former opponent working for Attorney General Josh Shapiro, Tutera indicated on Friday that he plans to “raise questions” to potential jurors — and perhaps to the court — “over whether this is the appropriate body to handle this process.”\nTutera did not mention the issue during a brief hearing before state Supreme Court-appointed Cambria County Senior Judge Timothy Creany while prosecutors were also present Friday, instead discussing the matter with media afterward.",
    "He added that Thomas wants the case tried by a jury of local residents, adding that many like him and think the state’s case against him “stinks.”\nCreany was appointed to oversee the case last fall at the request of Somerset County President Judge D. Gregory Geary to avoid potential bias, because Thomas spent the previous two years working in the same courthouse as all of Somerset County’s judges and prosecuted cases before them.",
    "Following a pretrial hearing, defense attorney Ryan Tutera offered hints at part of Thomas’ defense in the case, proposing questions that would ask potential jurors whether they support the #MeToo movement and whether they have provided support for local political parties or for former District Attorney Lisa Lazzari-Strasiser’s campaign.",

    "“Our track record proves that we show no fear or favor when holding people who break the law accountable for the crimes they commit.”\nCreany has set an April 29 hearing to discuss any motions in the case that could be filed.",
    "The review process for the questionnaires is standard in jury trials, as are court- approved questions, which both parties use to determine if residents can agree to listen to evidence in the case and render a fair verdict.",
    "He also proposed asking people if they ever have been represented by Matthew Zatko, a Somerset lawyer who has previously represented the alleged victim in the case when she filed a protection order against Thomas last fall.",

    "Creany has set an April 20 deadline for attorneys on both sides of the case to raise any issues that would have to be sorted out prior to a trial.",
    "Tutera has said the woman instead wore a “wire” — a court-approved recording device — to confront Thomas about her allegations two days later.",
    "“Our office had a good working relationship with his office before these charges were filed,” Shapiro’s office wrote in a statement Friday.",
    "Those questions routinely include asking potential jurors whether they have any prior relationships with anyone involved in the case.",

    "In this proceeding, that would include Thomas, the alleged victim and any attorneys in the case.",
    "“We are going to be looking into (potential motions) and go from there,” Tutera said.",
    "As of Friday afternoon, no motions were filed raising the question.",
