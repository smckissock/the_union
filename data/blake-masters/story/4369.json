    "Facebook, Facebook Ad Library, accessed Jan. 24, 2022\nOpen Secrets, Liberal ‘dark money’ groups’ revenue soared ahead of 2020 elections, Dec. 23, 2022\nOpen Secrets, ActBlue still outraises WinRed, but the GOP platform is catching up, Aug. 4, 2021\nEconomic Security Project Action, Who we are, accessed Jan. 24, 2022\nEconomic Security Project, Funding disclosure, accessed Jan. 24, 2022\nInterview, Anna Massoglia, editorial and investigations manager, Open Secrets, Jan. 24, 2022",
    "During the 2020 election cycle, it funneled $60 million to political committees backing Democratic candidates, plus $200 million to groups that either directly pressed for certain policies, or gave to super PACs that distributed the money further.",
    "Ruben’s bio places him in the left-leaning wing of the Democratic Party, with a list of past clients that includes Pro-Choice America and Run Warren Run, a group that hoped to see Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., run for the presidency in 2016.",
    "People’s profiles on Facebook and their browsing activity off the platform combine to generate enough information about age, gender, location and interests to help political groups and campaigns target their messages to specific audiences.",
    "The midterm election campaigns have barely begun, and politicians and advocacy groups are already spending over $1 million a day on Facebook ads to energize their supporters and gain new ones.",
    "But even if the financial backers remain hidden, the OpenSecrets website and the organization’s reports can reveal the networks of political operations that lie behind the Facebook ad.",
    "The ad contains inaccuracies about this academic school of thought and its alleged presence in the classroom, but the message has proven to be effective for Republicans.",
    "With it, you can get more details, such as who paid for the ad, the sort of people who have seen it, and how much money the group is spending on all its Facebook ads.",
    "\"Congress has always bailed out the big guys — the billionaires, the mega-corporations, the big banks and Wall Street execs — leaving working families in the dust.",
    "If all you want is to get a sense of the group’s political leanings — conservative, liberal, libertarian, and so forth — the Facebook ad library might be enough.",
    "But instead of listing backers of the group that paid for the ad, it leads to information about an affiliate called the Economic Security Project (no \"Action\").",
    "Click on the ad and you’ll be brought to this page and discover this ad is actually promoting one particular candidate, though he is not identified by name.",
    "And while this ad comes from a group focused on Arizona, most of the people who saw this same image lived elsewhere, such as Florida, Texas and California.",
    "Look at the URL for the petition page; it’s on a site run by WinRed, an online fundraising platform for Republican and Republican-oriented causes.",
    "This is an ad that ran recently in Arizona, with a specific call to action:\n\"Critical Race Theory has NO PLACE in classrooms anywhere in America.",
    "The ad, Massoglia said, likely plays a role in a broader GOP campaign that seeks to leverage the critical race theory issue across many states.",
    "If you don’t recognize the man shown between former President Donald Trump and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, one more step reveals who he is.",
    "Search for Invest in America in Facebook’s ad library and you’ll see the ad is paid for by a group called Economic Security Project Action.",
    "Masters is the chief operating officer at Thiel Capital, and his boss’ financial support gives him a key boost in the Republican primary.",
    "They are more likely to vote, which can be particularly helpful in primaries where turnout tends to be lower than in general elections.",
    "Massoglia took a comprehensive look at the organization at the center of the network that includes Economic Security Project Action.",
    "To see what this group is up to, search for the name of the PAC identified in the ad, \"Saving Arizona,\" on the Facebook ad tool.",
    "To find that donor, click the \"Outside Spending\" link, then click the \"Donors\" tab, and then click the \"View all donors\" link.",
    "The petition is a useful tool for building even more targeted lists of voters who are sympathetic to a particular cause.",
    "A Facebook ad about Arizona can end up as part of a larger effort to secure Republican victories, in Arizona and beyond.",
    "Phrases like \"protect democracy,\" or \"backing America\" fit equally well for both conservative and liberal organizations.",
    "There is a list of funders, but it’s not obvious what the list means, said Anna Massoglia, a researcher at OpenSecrets.",
    "Go to OpenSecrets.org and a search on that group shows that this is a PAC that backs Blake Masters for U.S. Senate.",
    "A simple web search will point you to the group’s website where you can glean several useful bits of information.",
    "In this example, each of the ads gives a different reason or sales pitch to support the Build Back Better Act.",
    "There are, however, three steps you can take to learn more about who is trying to get your attention, and why.",
    "The name of the Facebook page or account that placed the ad is always clear, but it might not tell you much.",
    "This ad supporting the bill appeared on Facebook news feeds Jan. 11, from a page labeled Invest in America.",
    "It may be because you match the advertiser’s target profile, or because someone in your network shared it.",
    "Many of President Joe Biden’s key campaign promises hinge on Congress passing the Build Back Better Act.",
    "\"This could be an umbrella list, for supporters of both groups, or just the affiliate,\" Massoglia said.",
    "The organization opposes the concentration of corporate power and backs providing a guaranteed income.",
    "But the affiliate relationship here gives a peek into an important dimension of political advertising.",
    "While the ad might focus on schoolchildren, it is aimed less at their parents than their grandparents.",
    "Facebook users would likely expect that once they sign the petition, they will be asked for money.",
    "\"Lists that are built by these common operations are then shared with other political committees.\"",
    "The Facebook ad library gives a window into the sort of people an ad targets, and who’s behind it.",
    "For those who want to persuade others, the beauty of online ads on Facebook is microtargeting.",
    "At this point, you’ve pretty much reached the end of the line for identifying specific donors.",
    "\"They way they worded this, it doesn’t have to be complete, and it doesn’t give the amounts.\"",
    "The Open Secrets website can reveal the network of political money that helped pay for an ad.",
    "You can also learn that this group spent about $22,000 in the past three months on 109 ads.",
    "Click it, and you’ll see images of all the other ads the group has purchased on Facebook.",
    "What might be less obvious is why this ad appears in so many states other than Arizona.",
    "The groups you see on Facebook are often part of a larger network of related entities.",
    "There are many ways for donors to stay in the shadows, so you might hit a brick wall.",
    "To learn more about how those ads were targeted, click on the summary details button.",
    "It’s a project of the group that sponsored the ad, Economic Security Project Action.",
    "We must stop left-wing politicians who are trying to indoctrinate our kids with it.",
    "There’s no candidate, party or organization specified, except in the small print.",
    "Neither of the affiliated organizations is required to disclose contributors.",
    "Another focuses on cutting taxes for middle-class families and creating jobs.",
    "Ideally, you can discover who is putting money into the group behind the ad.",
    "And you can see that it has one donor — a wealthy one who gave $10 million.",
    "The results show that the image in this ad was used in over 50 other ads.",
    "But if you want to go a little deeper, then you have a couple of choices.",
    "Plus, your search might point you to what’s been written about the group.",
    "The chart shows a full 75% of the people who saw the ad are 65 or older.",
    "You will see the $10 million donor is Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal.",
    "\"It’s not uncommon for lists to be sold or exchanged,\" Mossoglio said.",
    "In this case, the ad draws in people opposed to critical race theory.",
    "Please add your name to our petition to BAN Critical Race Theory.\"",
    "At the very bottom of the page, there’s a funding disclosure link.",
    "We’ll go through a couple of examples to show you how this works.",
    "That primary race helps explain why the ad targets older voters.",
    "A visit to the group’s website (if it has one) can be revealing.",
    "Yes, this is simple and obvious, but the basics often pay off.",
    "The number of ads in the far-right column is a clickable link.",
    "This sheds light on the range of topics the group tackles.",
    "The Who we are link shows that Adam Ruben is the director.",
    "Step Three: Go to the political money website OpenSecrets.",
    "But details about its funding sources aren’t so clear.",
    "The group’s fiscal sponsor is the Sixteen Thirty Fund.",
    "And that’s part of why it showed up in your News Feed.",
    "The ad asks you to \"add your name to our petition.\"",
    "That pace will only increase as the voting nears.",
    "Very little, if any, disclosure is required.",
    "(The Democratic counterpart is ActBlue.)",
    "The Saving Arizona PAC paid for the ad.",
    "Why do these ads show up in your feed?",
    "Step One: Facebook has an ad library.",
    "But who or what is Invest in America?",
    "You can go a step deeper, too.",
    "Half of the total are women.",
    "Step Two: Search the web.",
    "One last thing to note.",
    "No more,\" reads one ad."
