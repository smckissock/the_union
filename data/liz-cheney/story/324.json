    "It opens with the congressman declaring in his speech at the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally that America does not need any more weakling, cowering, wimpy Republican congressmen and senators.? After reminding viewers that on Jan. 6 he proudly stood with President Trump in the fight against voter fraud,? Brooks criticized others in his party whom he deems not onboard the MAGA agenda, including Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney  both frequent targets of Trump.",
    "Trump did tell the Examiner that Brooks still? has strong feeling about election fraud, so perhaps the dominant factor behind Trump's public waffling about his chosen candidate is actually that Brooks has been falling in the polls, and Trump surely doesn't want to support a loser.",
    "Less than 24 hours after a report indicated that Donald Trump has soured on Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), the Senate candidate whom he endorsed last year, Brooks released a campaign ad that doubles as a pledge of fealty to the former president and his lies about the 2020 election.",
    "I'm determining right now, has Mo Brooks  has he changed??\nTrump suggested that if Brooks appears to be shying away from his previously declared stance that the 2020 election was fraudulent and should be investigated, he could revoke his support.",
    "A poll conducted last week of 500 Republican primary voters had Brooks in the third spot with 17.6 percent, trailing businessman Mike Durant (33.8 percent) and retiring Sen. Richard Shelby's former chief of staff, Katie Britt (32 percent).",
    "(Perhaps realizing the danger of running afoul of Trump's supporters, he later asserted  falsely  on Twitter that Trump would have won the election if only legal votes? were counted.)",
    "If it meant what he sounded like, I would have no problem changing [my endorsement] because when you endorse somebody, you endorse somebody based on principle.",
    "I'm disappointed that he gave an inarticulate answer, and I'll have to find out what he means,? Trump said, referring to Brooks' rally comments.",
    "(The poll was commissioned by a political action committee for the Alabama Forestry Association, which endorsed Britt.)",
    "It's a very tight race between the three of them right now, and I'm not particularly happy,? Trump groused.",
    "At a Trump rally in Alabama last August, Brooks was booed for telling attendees to move past the election.",
    "The ex-president is considering pulling his endorsement, the Washington Examiner reported Wednesday.",
    "Mo Brooks is disappointing,? Trump told the publication during a phone interview earlier this week.",
    "If he changed that principle, I would have no problem doing that.?\nCue Brooks' new campaign ad.",
    "(He has reportedly floated the idea of making multiple endorsements for the same races.)"
