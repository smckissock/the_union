    "On Monday's edition of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" the panel discussed former President Donald Trump's efforts to influence primaries to oust Republicans he perceives as disloyal to him as he came off a rally in Michigan  and how he could ultimately blow the influence he currently enjoys in the party.",
    "We may be having the conversation that Trump is throwing up L's and if he can't bat 0.500 over the next four months, Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis begin to stand up and get around, like, Joni Ernst, others begin to coalesce around somebody that is not Donald Trump.\"",
    "The only two times he has done this prior was in 2018 in the Mark Sanford race and in the Kris Kobach race, in which he backed primary challengers.",
    "\"To suggest his influence has diminished in the party would be willful ignorance,\" said analyst Vaughn Hillyard.",
    "Over the next four months I think we will get a good taste of just how potent his influence is.\"",
    "He's putting his own political capital on the line like we have never seen him willfully do.",
    "\"I always remember when he'd say something and get a spattering of boos from the crowd.",
    "\"This is the first time Trump's really put it out on the line,\" said Scarborough.",
    "These are the GOP incumbents Trump has backed primary challengers against here.",
    "\"One week ago he was in Georgia, two weeks ago in South Carolina.",
    "In South Carolina, trying to take down Nancy Mace, Tom Rice.",
    "\"And next may is that Georgia primary,\" added Hillyard.",
    "But you look at Liz Cheney, Liz is not concerned.",
    "\"There is another one, West Virginia next month.",
    "These are part of what we call the 'Big 12'.",
    "He's doing extraordinarily well right now.",
    "Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, Brian Kemp.",
    "But he's taking  look at Fred Upton.",
    "Michigan, Peter Meijer, Fred Upton.",
    "There's races he is interested in.",
    "But here he's going after people.",
    "She knows it is tough and tight.",
    "He knows how to win elections.\"",
    "Anchor Joe Scarborough agreed.",
    "He would immediately back up.",
    "For instance, Brian Kemp.",
    "I know it is still early.",
    "She's just not concerned.",
    "Why is this significant?",
    "But why these states?",
    "I served with Fred.",
