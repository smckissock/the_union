    "That means Democrats should take what might be an unpalatable course: In states and districts where the party stands little chance of winning in the general election, Democrats should endorse and enthusiastically support anti-Trump Republicans who run as independents.",
    "| Jeffrey D. Allred/The Deseret News via AP\nOpinion by Juleanna Glover and Kalee Kreider\n 02/01/2022 03:58 PM EST\nJuleanna Glover and Kalee Kreider led communications for Vice Presidents Dick Cheney and Al Gore, respectively.",
    "Both Allen and Coram's primary runs look quixotic at this point in a party dominated by Trump, but if they ran as right-leaning independents in the general election  with no Democrat on the ballot  the math could work.",
    "This approach might sound like a fanciful waste of Democratic resources  backing a Republican to beat a Republican  but it's an effort worth making to vote out at least a few of the most ardent Trump supporters.",
    "A coalition of Democrats and the center-right should first target members of Congress who narrowly won election in red districts and are among the most virulent in perpetuating the election fraud myths.",
    "In the 2020 election, some in the GOP showed a willingness to cross party lines, as Republicans like Cindy McCain, Meg Whitman, Jeff Flake and the late Colin Powell endorsed Joe Biden for president.",
    "As Aaron Blake of the Washington Post recently noted, Democrats backed independents like Angus King, who won his 2012 Maine Senate race, and Bill Walker, who won his 2014 Alaska governor's race.",
    "If they want to improve their odds and deny the Trumpists a toehold back into power, Democratic leaders should join forces with anti-Trump Republicans to outvote the hucksters and fraudsters.",
    "At such a perilous moment, party labels are less important now; the real bifurcation is between those who are committed to our system of government and those who would see it collapse.",
    "Independent Kansas Senate candidate Greg Orman, who had Democrats' support, fell short in 2014, but he gave then-Sen. Pat Roberts the smallest share of votes in his long career.",
    "The embrace of Donald Trump's Big Lie by large swaths of the country and much of the Republican Party is a direct threat to free and fair elections in the United States.",
    "In this circumstance and in others, national Democrats should back pro-democracy Republicans running as independents in order to overpower Trump allies on Election Day.",
    "Some Republicans who backed Biden last year were rewarded not just with the satisfaction of being on the right side of history, but with prestigious ambassadorships.",
    "At the top of the list should be election deniers like GOP Reps. Scott Perry, Burgess Owens, Bob Good, Dan Bishop, Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert and Madison Cawthorn.",
    "In Utah, former Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams ended his Senate candidacy and threw his support and operation behind Evan McMullin, who is running as an independent.",
    "And these newly elected, nominal independents would likely caucus with Democrats and might even make the difference in deciding which party controls Capitol Hill.",
    "What would Democrats get for doing the same to support the Republicans and independents who stand a chance of stopping the worst of the Trump lot in 2022?",
    "Those endorsements bolstered Biden's bipartisan bona fides, and Cindy McCain's support may have helped him win her late husband's home state of Arizona.",
    "But many other candidates in red states and districts across the country should be considered for this approach, depending on the opponents they draw.",
    "Evan McMullin, who is running for Sen. Mike Lee's seat as an independent, walks back to his car after an interview in Salt Lake City in October 2021.",
    "Democrats have little hope of winning Wyoming's at-large House seat, but Cheney would have a shot at victory with a larger, non-primary electorate.",
    "But it is a strategic, targeted push against the worst perpetrators of the election lies and would create new incentives for others in the GOP.",
    "It's early in the cycle, so the field of potential opponents is still fuzzy, and redistricting will shift some of these lawmakers' districts.",
    "The DNC should start the process now of researching state laws so that pro-democracy GOP candidates can get on the ballots as independents.",
    "This is also the perfect strategy to keep Rep. Liz Cheney in Congress if she loses her primary in August and must run as an independent.",
    "This scenario, of course, requires the Democratic Party organization and its voters to fall in line and support a former Republican.",
    "An independent candidate would only need to peel off a few percentage points of the GOP vote to win in the general election.",
    "But it could be the only path to beating the most egregious proponents of Trumpism and holding on to the party's majority.",
    "In the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats face a difficult path to holding onto their House and Senate majorities.",
    "A Democrat in Utah has only a narrow path to winning statewide, especially as Biden's approval numbers slide.",
    "In 2022, pro-democracy forces in both parties should consider supercharging an inverse of this strategy.",
    "Every pro-Trump GOP candidate running in a red state this cycle could be vulnerable to such a strategy.",
    "And this list should certainly not be limited to incumbents who essentially embraced the insurrection.",
    "In fact, Democrats have previously used this strategy in states where they otherwise faced slim odds.",

    "McAdams sees McMullin's bid as the only opportunity to defeat GOP Sen. Mike Lee, an ally of Trump.",
    "But in the case of Perry and Boebert, both have already drawn principled GOP primary opponents.",
    "This won't be possible in some states as ballot access for independents can be complicated.",

    "Democrats in each race won 46 percent and 45 percent of the 2020 votes, respectively.",
    "Brian Allen, a right-leaning political newcomer, is primarying Perry.",
    "Utah is a conservative state, but not in a Trumpy, xenophobic way.",
