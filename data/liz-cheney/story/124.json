    "Williams then asked Sabatini to explain his MAGA? tweet, and Sabatini answered, The most appropriate reaction to the deliberately biased and distorted coverage of the rally by the anti-Trump Orlando Sentinel yesterday is to not comment on its spin and sensation, but to ignore the content and reply with the peaceful phrase they hate  MAGA.? Williams referred him specifically not towards the rally, but towards his assault, asking in a follow-up, Is this conduct you condone?? Sabatini then said Williams was illiterate and a modern journalist,? before later telling the Orlando Sentinel that You're searching for incidents that were very rare at the event in order to cast a dark, negative light on the event.?\n In 2020, Anthony Sabatini, along with Florida House Speaker Jose Oliva and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz were all exposed at CPAC 2020 to a man who later tested positive for Covid-19.",
    "If Webster does anything good in his career as a Republican in Congress, it will be to be the blockade against Anthony Sabatini wandering into Washington, D.C.\n At the moment, Sabatini is feuding with fellow Republicans in the Florida state legislature, including calling some cuck?, because they dared to question why he would not show up to vote for two months straight while publicly campaigning for that Congressional seat out-of-state during the middle of the legislative session, earning him the nickname Absentini?, while taking note that Sabatini has never sponsored any legislation that has passed.",
    "Throughout 2021, Sabatini was railing against both Covid-19 vaccines and mask mandates, perhaps punctuated best in his lunacy in May of 2021 when he posted on Twitter, END THE MASK CULT NOW!?\n As we have dreaded, this race-baiting, deranged bomb-thrower within the GOP has designs on higher office, and in 2022, he's going to try run for Congress in Florida's 11th Congressional District, where he'll be challenging one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, Daniel Webster, who is somehow, don't ask us how, the more palatable of the two.",

    "Well, six months after he was in office, Sabatini's true colors continued to be on display, as a reporter for the Orlando Sentinel, Michael Williams, posted a video of a Trump supporter at an Orlando rally attacking him, trying to slap his phone out of his hand and threatening him (the attacker was arrested and charged with battery).",
    "On this date in both 2020, as well as 2021, Fanatical Republican Extremist of the Day? first profiled Anthony Sabatini, who won office for the first time in 2018 after winning a plurality of votes in the GOP primary against two opponents, and defeating Democrat Cynthia Brown with 56% of the vote in the general election.",
    "And, like you would expect this racist troll might do, on Nov 21st, 2020, he took to Twitter to not just give his support for accused-murderer-on-trial-who-hangs-out-with racist-hate-groups-on-parole Kyle Rittenhouse, but encouraged the young homicidal maniac to run for Congress.",
    "In a very telling move, Sabatini chose to push even harder for the insurrectionists to target specific Republicans he felt were without courage? and didn't support Trump's attempt to seize power, including Mitt Romney, Susan Murkowski, and Liz Cheney.",
    "Perhaps this would be a good time to also point out that while a city commissioner for the city of Eustis, Anthony Sabatini responded to national news of Confederate statues being removed to have them all brought to his town to be displayed.",
    "There's just there's no bottom for this motherf***er, and he's all but declared he'll run over anything or anyone in his path to power, as part of The Trump Train? not that he knows what he'd do with it whenever he gets it.",
    "He's all bluster and making headlines for being a d***, like currently making threats at Disney and promising them a living Hell? for not continuing to fund Florida Republicans campaign of anti-LGBTQ legislation.",
    "And then, the photo emerged of Sabatini dressed up as a Mexican? wearing brownface from 2004, and that he drove around a car painted up with a Confederate flag like the General Lee from Dukes of Hazard.",
    "Now, there are some examples of this from modern politicians and they shrug and say, it was a different time? and the photos are from the 1960s or 1970s is a pattern we've seen.",
    "He'll post video of legal workers on Twitter, claiming a hotel was hiring illegals?, risking their lives and the hotel they worked at to anti-immigrant hatred and it's all lies.",
    "Six weeks later, and Anthony Sabatini, like many Republicans, had to reckon with the aftermath on the failed coup attempt carried out by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol.",
    "His status as a Covidiot is highly determined, however, as he has filed no less than 14 lawsuits against Manatee Country to try and prevent any mask mandates whatsoever.",
    "However, Williams and most everyone else were disgusted when Sabatini responded to the video of his assault by commenting, MAGA? to it.",

    "Sabatini, however, doesn't have the benefit of time being on his side, because the photos of him are from 2005.",
    "Which, in Florida, isn't exactly a draconian, oppressive thing, given the stupidity of Gov.",
    "That was even though in October of 2018, photos emerged of Sabatini in blackface.",
