    "But I was able to have this apprenticeship with the greatest reporters of their day, and greatest editors, during a period of civil rights, the Kennedy presidency and assassination, the beginning of the Great Society, the beginning of the war in Vietnam, and also this kid covering cops, con-men, the streets and alleyways of the capital, which is a very different city than the marble columned halls of government, shrines and emblems of the nation.",
    "Pulitzer-winning reporter spins marvelous tales of his early years  and their strange echoes in the Trump era\nUS journalist Carl Bernstein (Oscar Gonzalez/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nCarl Bernstein's memoir of his apprenticeship in reporting, \"Chasing History: A Kid in the Newsroom,\" is on the surface a story about journalism, and about America, in a historical period that to most of us now seems long in the past.",
    "It's not what's going on in the capital, it's what's going on with people in this country, including state legislatures, including politicians, including the Capitol building in Washington, but also the people and what is on their minds and what is in their hearts and what is in their prejudices and what is in their hatreds.",
    "People aren't going outside the newsroom, they're using Google, they're occasionally using the cellphone, but by and large  there are thousands of people doing what's called news in this country, and this is not about nostalgia  they don't go out of the office, they don't knock on the doors, they don't develop sources.",
    "Goldwater was drinking a Scotch and he went and got his diary, and he told us how he and the leaders of the Republican Party, after Nixon's tapes had come out  the Judiciary Committee in the House had voted impeachment articles  now it was going to be certain impeachment and trial in the Senate.",
    "In our recent conversation for Salon Talks, Bernstein told me that he hadn't exactly been conscious, while writing \"Chasing History,\" that so many of the themes of his youthful career would resonate in 2022  he made the connections at an intuitive level, which is after all what writers do.",
    "There's a key paragraph in this book when I describe what I do as learning about the best obtainable words, and the truth in this paragraph comes during the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the realization that the Star and reporting were a refuge for me from the discomfort I felt in ideology.",
    "One of the problems today in news is that the methodology, which should be preeminent and prominent and we should be using these amazing tools that we have to work more rapidly and give more depth to our stories -- but the reporting, the basic reporting, has to be done the old way.",
    "It's both subtler and more interesting than that, as well as an immensely entertaining read  jam-packed with famous names and juicy anecdotes  for anyone who cares about the past and future of journalism, or the lessons to be drawn from that tumultuous period of American history.",
    "I didn't even ask him about being played by Dustin Hoffman in the most famous of all journalism movies, or about his period of full-on celebrity in the late '70s and '80s, when he reportedly dated Bianca Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor and Martha Stewart, among other famous women.",
    "This book is hardly just about race, it's about covering a plane crash, it's about going to after-hours clubs in the middle of the night, it's about interviewing Barry Goldwater by ham radio, as I did the day that he was nominated to be president of the United States.",
    "It's another amazing thing about the Star: When I went to work there,, the head copy boy gave me a tour of the newsroom, which is described in the book, in the opening of the book, and he took me down the center aisle on either side of which was the reporters' desks.",
    "It ends in 1965, and it covers this amazing five-year period of my life when I go to work as a copy boy at this amazing newspaper, and for the next five years, this kid, and it's written in the voice of the kid, gets to have the greatest seat in the country.",
    "The Post had a government columnist who was a red-baiter, and covered the strike looking for subversion, rather than covering the fact that government workers at government cafeterias and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing couldn't get a dollar an hour.",
    "This book is, as you indicated, about the five-year period from age 16 to 21 that I worked in my apprenticeship at probably the greatest afternoon newspaper in America, the Washington Evening Star in my native city, I'm a second-generation Washingtonian.",
    "or over the threat of right-wing insurrectionist violence (again, really)  would resurface in our drastically different era, clad in new rhetorical garb but reflecting the same unanswered questions that have tormented America since the beginning.",
    "This book begins there, allowing for a bit of back story, and concludes in 1966, after Bernstein had left the Star and spent a year at the Elizabeth Daily Journal in New Jersey (a paper that, almost unbelievably, had a circulation of 50,000).",
    "I had heard that Goldwater was a ham radio operator and that he had taken his equipment out to the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco with him so he could play at being a ham radio operator while he was getting nominated to be president.",
    "I tell younger reporters that there's a big difference between your personal opinion, which should not play a role in reporting, and the historical and social context that's necessary to understanding an issue, to telling the truth.",
    "What at first appears to be a story about the past turns out, as is so often true, to be a story about the present, or perhaps an illustration of Faulkner's famous pronouncement that the past isn't dead, and isn't even past.",
    "You talk about what you realized when writing that story: There's a crucial difference between a story as an assembly of facts, which may be accurate in themselves, and presenting them in a context in which they make sense.",
    "One of his mentors at the paper, Mary Lou Werner  herself one of the first prominent female news reporters  had won a Pulitzer for her coverage of the racist \"massive resistance\" against school desegregation in Virginia.",
    "I was both relieved and delighted to discover that \"Chasing History\" is not an elder statesman's nostalgic account of the Good Old Days, nor a reverse-engineered personal history of how a Great Man rose from obscurity.",
    "His future reporting partner at the Post, Bob Woodward  alongside whom Bernstein became a household name and half of the most famous investigative team in our profession's history  only appears in the acknowledgments.",
    "But Bernstein could not have foreseen how many of the \"local\" issues he covered as a teenage cub reporter  battles over racial issues in education, over voter suppression and false claims of voter fraud (yes, really!)",
    "He knew his book was partly about racism and race relations, a beat he frequently covered as a young reporter and one of the Star's strengths (despite its nearly all-white newsroom, which was certainly not unusual.)",
    "The first thing I did when they made me a reporter at 19, it was a horrible, terrible thing, I was sent to National Airport to spend the day with Rita Schwerner, who was  she didn't know she was a widow yet.",
    "So my father got me an interview at the conservative Washington Star, which  in those days, the joy we took in beating the Washington Post and being a better newspaper was part of the esprit of the newsroom.",
    "There was a guy named John Sherwood who would ply the Chesapeake Bay in his sloop and find these islands where the oystermen still spoke almost in Elizabethan dialect, and write these rhapsodic pictures.",
    "My father got me an interview at the Star because his union was the United Public Workers of America, the government workers' union, and the Star had covered a strike by his union with great fairness.",
    "Then, going about the reporting, the perseverance, the refusing to use just one source, but going to one source after another, all the things that the movie of \"All the President's Men\" shows so well.",
    "Woodward and I, when we wrote \"The Final Days,\" about the end of Richard Nixon's presidency, we went to see Barry Goldwater, who remembered this interview that I had done with him by ham radio.",
    "What I learned covering civil rights was that when you see and hear the widow of one of the three men shot to death and put under a levee in Mississippi, there aren't two sides to that story.",
    "Richard Nixon certainly comes up, first as a defeated presidential candidate in 1960 and then, two years later, as a defeated gubernatorial candidate clear across the country in California.",
    "He had a lot to say in our conversation, about the state of journalism then and now, about the contradictions of truth-telling in the Trump era, about the imperiled state of our democracy.",
    "So what I hope comes through the pages is the kid being open to all of these different forces, including everything I know about how to be a reporter and these people who became my family.",
    "One of the things that happens, if you're a writer, not just a reporter  one of the great things I got to do at the Star was study some of the greatest writers for newspapers in America.",
    "It's not about your career at the Washington Post or your partnership with Bob Woodward or the reporting on Watergate that led to \"All the President's Men,\" both the book and the movie.",
    "I don't know the exact percentage, but certainly huge numbers of people, maybe most people in this country, are looking for news and information to reinforce what they already believe.",
    "There is an integration in the book of our lives in Washington at the time, and particularly what I was doing as a young reporter and a copy boy with all these opportunities.",
    "I'll bet you that one-fiftieth of the people watching us right now know that the capital of the United States had segregated public schools until Brown vs Board of Education.",
    "2 daily in Washington, D.C. (The Star ceased publication in 1981, part of a wave of newspaper consolidation that prefigured the industry-wide collapse of the internet era.)",
    "So the book is not written from the point of view of the old man looking back: Nothing in the action of the book, except for an epilogue, says anything about the future.",
    "It's also the experience of this kid in the capital of the United States, watching history in front of him, but without a recognition that these were hinges of history.",
    "We had a coup, a conspiracy by the president of the United States to undermine the free electoral process in this country, followed and enabled by the Republican Party.",
    "At the time I'm describing in this book, at the time of Watergate, most people were open to the best attainable version of the truth, the complexity of the truth.",
    "I mean, you talk about how the Star was a great newspaper but you never strike that elegiac tone of, like, \"Everything was better then, everything is worse now.\"",
    "They were found about 72 hours after I met with Rita Schwerner, under a levee in Mississippi, victims of the horror that was going on in the South at that time.",
    "What I loved about Carl Bernstein's book was the same thing I most enjoyed about talking to him personally: the endless curiosity and the sense of discovery.",
    "I found this ham radio operator in Arlington, Virginia, and we got on the ham radio and Goldwater says, \"I'm Zero Kilowatts, this, that and the other thing.\"",
    "They took me with them when I was eight, nine years old, to these sit-ins at the lunch counters and at the Tea Room in Woodward & Lathrop department store.",
    "So when you write, and this is true sometimes even when you're just writing on deadline, but it's really true when you're writing a book, you don't know.",
    "You have to go back to the Civil War to have this kind of sedition, but never have we had a seditious president or a totally seditious political party.",
    "Recently we saw two members on the House floor, two Republicans who were wiling to go onto the floor during the talk about the Jan. 6 insurrection.",
    "The other element, and this is different from the time I was at the Star, is that the big story in this country today is the culture of America.",
    "The line in the book  I remember reading it when I wrote it and saying, \"Ah, I've been able to express this,\" is that the truth is not neutral.",
    "It's about how you broke into this business as a teenager at the Washington Star, a daily paper that hasn't existed for more than 40 years now.",
    "We were a better paper than the Post partly because the line between church and state, between opinion and reporting, was absolute at the Star.",
    "Bernstein's future employer, the Washington Post, mostly plays a role in this story as the snooty, less enterprising competitor to the Star.",
    "I talk about the first sit-ins with my parents, who were left-wing people and were very instrumental in desegregating downtown Washington.",
    "If you're wondering whether she was connected to an infamous left-wing movement, as I know your family was, the answer is absolutely yes.",
    "So you get a sense of the country, in my five years at the Star -- which bracketed the years of the Civil War, 100 years later exactly.",
    "That's very true, because it's about, again, an experience that is absolutely formative in my life, and it's told as I experienced it.",
    "Goldwater, the former presidential nominee, a conservative in his party, organized the Republican leadership to go to the White House.",
    "Well, you know, my father was a union organizer, my parents were members of the Communist Party in the '40s, the book mentions that.",
    "A year ago, Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, said exactly what was true: The president was responsible for this.",
    "You're in a different place when you're writing, and then you look at the paragraph or the sentence and you say, \"Oh, my God.\"",
    "He was about to return to Washington and take a job with the Star's better-known competitor  but that story is not this one.",
    "There had to be a separate case, Bolling vs Sharpe, which was about the District of Columbia public schools that I was in.",
    "I learned that covering civil rights and I learned it particularly from Southern reporters who were covering civil rights.",
    "So there is a straight line from this book to Watergate and \"All the President's Men,\" but the future is never mentioned.",
    "I definitely agree that the kind of training and rigor you write about in this book is more difficult to find these days.",
    "Well, here's the other difference between the period when I worked at the Star and even at the Washington Post and today.",
    "Bernstein's first job in the business came in 1960, as a 16-year-old \"copy boy\" for the Evening Star, at the time the No.",
    "So that experience was formative, and it's an experience that was formative for the country, as well as for journalism.",
    "(When the video was off, we debated which of us has deeper parental roots in the American left: I think it's a tie.)",
    "Now he's trying to conspire to shut down a legitimate investigation of this sabotage of democracy, of this sedition.",
    "So the same bifurcation that we have in the country, the same polarization, exists in terms of consumption of news.",
    "We proceeded to have this interview hours away from when he was nominated, it was hilarious, got on the front page.",
    "Even when I left as a reporter at age 21, the copy boys were still older than me, or a good number of them were.",
    "It has been taken over by these seditious forces who are willing to do anything that Trump says should be done.",
    "Liz Cheney and her father, the former vice president, exercising his privileges as a former member of Congress.",
    "They sat across from Richard Nixon, and Nixon asked Goldwater, \"Barry, how many votes do I have in the Senate?\"",
    "Were you conscious when you were writing the book that it wasn't about the '60s, that it was also about today?",

    "My mother was a union organizer at the time too, and her husband was a reporter for the Daily Worker.",

    "(Bernstein acknowledges, in passing, that his destiny and Nixon's would cross paths in the future.)",

    "There are times when I was doing that in this book and I would say, \"That's Donald Trump.\"",
    "My parents, even though they were left-wing people, my father actually detested ideology.",

    "But the Republican Party was not ready to put up with this criminal presidential conduct.",
    "It's about the restoration or stripping of that Voting Rights Act that I covered in 1965.",
