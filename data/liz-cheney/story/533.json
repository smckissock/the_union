    "Even worse, all that intra-GOP battling distracts from the Democrats' own divisions, which McConnell's team has been doing a good job of branding as Dems in Disarray.?\nThe good news for Republicans is that the political ground remains fertile for them, and narrow Democratic majorities mean that even modest Republican gains in November could easily lead to GOP control of the House and the Senate.",
    "And as a House committee continues to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, the probe  essentially asking, What did the president do, and when did he do it??  has led Republicans to expose their internal cracks between those who remain enthusiastic backers of all things Trump and those willing to be critical of the former president (or those who just hope to avoid him as a topic).",
    "That means the focus for people paying attention to political news is not on what Republicans should be highlighting: an unpopular president, the belief among a majority of voters that the country is moving in the wrong direction, inflation, rising violent crime and the growing number of Democratic governors removing mask mandates, a move for which they'd long criticized Republicans.",
    "The move to censure Cheney and Kinzinger was an internal RNC process  which is to say, it was a self-inflicted injury that became a dominant news story, complete with infighting among committee members and several vocal Capitol Hill Republicans, including McConnell (Ky.) and Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah).",
    "If these were normal political times, it should be easy for Republicans all to sing from the same hymn book, focusing the party's energy on President Biden and his congressional allies, seeking to pick off the Democratic majority seat by seat and effectively ending the Biden legislative agenda.",
    "Instead of focusing solely on pressing Democratic weaknesses  the then-unpopular Obamacare bill, the lack of a coherent response to the long-running BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, rising taxes and deficits  precious time was lost trying to take care of avoidable blunders.",
    "Back then, the RNC was hit by wave after wave of controversy, including, infamously, a scandal in which a staffer spent nearly $2,000 of the party's money at a risque Los Angeles nightclub and a leaked internal fundraising memo critical of party donors.",
    "As a Democratic president's popularity sagged, a Republican gubernatorial victory in Virginia (and, in 2010, in New Jersey, whose election for 2022 was much closer than widely predicted) signaled that the Democratic lock on Washington was in trouble.",
    "Obvious, because the RNC is eager to do all it can to stay in Donald Trump's good graces  as demonstrated by the committee footing the bill for his legal expenses, even though the former president controls a $120 million war chest of his own.",
    "Come November, perhaps this fight will be little remembered, just as I can barely remember some RNC imbroglios that consumed my life in 2010; it's the kind of political inside baseball that doesn't register with voters more broadly.",
    "The stakes here are much higher: The RNC is targeting its own members of Congress and changing rules so that committee funds may be spent on a Republican primary (which might draw money away from targeting Democratic seats).",
    "This was already going to be fodder for the Sunday shows, even before Trump released the inevitable statement Wednesday attacking McConnell and continuing to push the lie that his 2020 election loss was fraudulent.",
    "Trump, in his effort to salve his wounds from losing to Biden, has shown his willingness to exploit party divisions, even with the House and Senate in the balance  as Republicans learned last year in Georgia.",
    "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's comment Tuesday on the censure  That's not the job of the RNC?  sounded awfully similar to comments that Capitol Hill Republicans directed at the RNC in 2010.",
    "The description of those storming the Capitol  people seeking to lynch Vice President Mike Pence  as ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse? is seriously troubling.",
    "Republicans could have supported an independent commission to investigate the attack on the Capitol, or they could have nominated Republican members they knew would not be rejected.",
    "Curious, because by taking the unprecedented step against two Republican members of Congress, the committee ensured that the GOP's internal divisions would come to the surface.",
    "Certainly voters then didn't punish the GOP: Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House and six in the Senate, though Democrats retained control of the upper chamber.",
    "and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) at its recent winter meeting in Salt Lake City for the crime of merely participating in the investigation both obvious and curious.",
    "Indeed, the unheard-of and, until now, unfathomable move by the RNC to throw shade at its own top senators will keep the issue alive for several more days.",
    "Republican congressional leaders vented their frustration publicly and privately because the party committee should not have been a front-page story.",
    "This is happening at a time when much of the political incentive structure rewards fighting over actual results and encourages intraparty battles.",
    "Complete coverage: Pro-Trump mob storms Capitol building\nProfiles of three involved in the attack: A horn-wearing shaman.' A cowboy evangelist.",
    "Any day wasted on self-inflicted controversies  and we're on day five of this one now  is a day that's not being spent defining your opponent.",
    "I was the committee's communications director at the time, and dealing with these kinds of stories constituted my worst days on the job.",
    "McConnell is mindful of this, which is why, while being clear and consistent on Jan. 6, he has otherwise tread carefully around Trump.",
    "And, as we've seen in the past and are seeing still, Trump is willing to exploit divides however and whenever he sees fit.",
    "That the RNC has now labeled those senators as part of the D.C. bubble? will not do anything to quell the back and forth.",
    "Whenever we became the center of national news, the self-inflicted crises caused us to retreat into a bunker mentality.",
    "If they want to maximize their chances of success, the best thing they can do is avoid unnecessary intraparty fighting.",
    "Today's tension between the RNC and the Capitol Hill GOP is somewhat reminiscent of the 2010 election cycle.",
    "Each time, it was as if the RNC had made an in-kind contribution to the Democratic National Committee.",
    "Politically, 2022 looks a lot like 2010, the last time Republicans won the House of Representatives.",
    "Which made the decision of the Republican National Committee to censure Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.)",
    "Republican voter enthusiasm began to rise, as did confidence about big GOP gains in Congress.",
    "But historically speaking, this year's elections still favor Republicans.",
    "They chose not to and are now playing with the cards they've been dealt.",
    "And these divisions were guaranteed to bring significant media coverage.",
    "For some, the Capitol attack was a kind of Christian revolt.",
    "Election Day always comes faster than campaigns think.",
    "That's surely what this month's vote was, too.",
    "The RNC controversies of 2010 were trivial.",
    "But Republicans should not take that risk.",
    "Instead, it's on Republican infighting.",
    "These are no ordinary times, though."
