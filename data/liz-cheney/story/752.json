    "In Kentucky, we have Beshear the governor, North Carolina is governed by Pat Cooper, Virginia has its two senators and Mr. Northam, John Bel Edwards is in Louisiana, and Doug Jones from Alabama was recently enough senator that throwing him in makes sense.",
    "Pundits gonna pundit, and one of the pundity things they've been doing recently is speculating about 2024 presidential candidates, since Biden is old and approval rating is low but mostly because, well, what else could you possibly do with your time?",
    "Oh yes, and Colorado has a high fraction of latinos, so these candidates quite possibly avoid that electoral niggle.I'm being told that I just made a factual, informative opinion and that such things are not allowed in posts like this.",
    "for various non-humorous reasons, we don't have equivalent pictures of female politicians, so boosting male support using a similar strategy, or going for the strongest ticket in history with a mixed gender ticket, is not in the cards.",
    "Bel Edwards sounds like a high class, cultured, educated man in the finest southern traditions, a sort of patrician or whatever you call them who could appeal to the more cultured elements the dems are trying to capture.",
    "Pat Cooper takes a different route of sounding like the lower class, maybe appalacian sort of name, attempting to hold in to the white working class to slow their transition to the other party.",
    "Yes, in a party whose strongest support is from the Northeast and now West, and whose support in the South is in not so southern areas*, I still saw some people arguing for a southern moderate.",
    "Some of you will suggest Ossoff and Warnock, but Ossoff goes to the wrong sort of church and Warnock lacks the visual appearance of looking like the sort of moderate we're thinking of.",
    "Pocahontas was somewhere in the 20's or so when the movie was made (according to various googling, I have not actually seen the movie) so if the perfect age now to run for president.",
    "Still if you're going to use this method, might as well go all in and pick not just a moderate from the south, but the most southern person you can find in this category.",
    "pic.twitter.com/ZEPUVU01gQ\n g miguel g (@miguel4congress) December 19, 2021\nWith Hillary Clinton running, many thought dems would get extra support from women in 2016.",
    "Pat Cooper (NC)\n John Bel Edwards (LA)\n Pocahontas (VA)\n Hickenlooper (CO)\n Bennett(CO)\n Ossoff (GA)\n None of these, we need the obvious choice: Captain America (NY?",
    "Welcome to the largest gender gap in history as 70/80/maybe even 90% of woman voters turn out for the democrats, with a bonus of non-straight male votes as well.",
    "you could legitimately argue that heavily black areas are strongly southern in their own way, but this is putting in more thought than a humor post really needs.",
    "Younger turnout (meaning below 40-50ish?) is always an issue in elections, what better than someone a lot of such people are familiar with from the documentary?",
    "Probably not, but they did have at least a little experience of some sot of presidential campaign of some kind, so could hit the ground with their legs moving.",
    "To really use such a strategy fully, you want candidates that very few people have heard of, and not for any particular personality whatsoever.",
    "Doug Jones, Tim Kaine, and Mark Warner are the sort of generic or less generic names you could find about anywhere, so they are backup options.",
    "and because Clinton has been famous for a long time and do you really want to punish pundits by forcing them to learn about someone new?",
    "With well informed speculation they have proposed Liz Cheney for VP and Hillary Clinton for president because Bipartisanship!!!",
    "so people like Bullock are out: he's from Montana and has a cool name (Does a better last name exist for a Montana politician?",
    "Plus the more recent documentary subjects like Elsa and Moana are not allowed by the American born requirement for president.",
    "So now we have to pick the most Southern, and unfortunately learning about these candidate's lives, personalities, etc.",
    "And I do like the irony that two thirds of these picks are from the south after my first comment in the first section.",
    "Biden may have been a generic, inoffensive white guy, but was a nationally known generic, inoffensive white guy.",
    "Pocahontas\nNot the Pocahontas in Virginia in the 1600's actually, but the subject of Disney's 1995 documentary.",
    "*Sees lots of you about to answer* Yes, yes, I know you have questions, we'll get to you when the post is done.",
    "just know nothing about these guys other than moderate, dem, Colorado, maybe some Geology something or other?",
    "And as part of a long running political family, she will have the experience needed to settle into the job.",
    "*In the sense that cities vote dem and are getting more similar to cities elsewhere in the country.",

    "Yes, even people born after the movie came out, who hasn't watched Disney movies at home?",
    "But speculation is fun, I'll throw in my own proposals for a 2024 presidential candidate.",
