Honig said on CNN's Newsroom.?\nI think what the committee is trying to do here is amp up the pressure on Merrick Garland, (saying) we want you to start looking at the bosses, we want you to start looking at the people who plotted this in advance.?\nExtending the committee's legacy\nWhile it's one thing for the committee to make a conspiracy argument in a case relating to attorney-client privilege, it's another thing to produce compelling evidence that would stand up in a straight prosecution.",
    "Some of those lines of effort appear to violate federal law, and we don't think that any communications in the service of that fraud and that obstruction should be privileged in any way.?\nWednesday's filing was also interesting because it included evidence  in the form of emails between then-Vice President Mike Pence's lawyer Greg Jacob and Eastman  that appear to show that people inside the White House knew the scheme to overturn the election in the Electoral College was wrong.",
    "A final report into that day of infamy, when the Trump-incited mob stormed the Capitol to try to stop Congress ratifying Joe Biden's victory, that gets big headlines and drops in the last few months of the 2022 campaign could impact public opinion, raise pressure for Congress to enact reforms and be a milestone in history.",
    "If the Justice Department believes there is evidence of crime, involving anyone, including the former President, they should be investigating.?\nThe Justice Department has no requirement to wait for Congress, historically doesn't wait for Congress, and I don't think should wait for Congress here,? he added.",

    "But if the panel were to successfully convince the Justice Department that a prosecution of Trump or acolytes was justified, its work could live on and force Trump to face elusive accountability even if a new Republican House majority ends its mandate.",
    "That is why the court filing this week  in which the panel accused Trump and right-wing lawyer John Eastman, who allegedly masterminded the ex-President's attempt to steal the election in Congress, of a criminal conspiracy?  is so interesting.",
