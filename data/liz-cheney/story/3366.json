    "Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, said that with Kemp being \"target number one\" for Trump, Republicans who do not support the former president and his vision have seen that \"the biggest blow they could deliver to begin freeing the GOP of Trumpism\" would be to beat his candidate in Georgia and securing the governor's reelection.",
    "As with a number of other midterms across the country, the gubernatorial primary in Georgia will be a sign of just how influential an endorsement is from Trump as the former president aims to shape the Republican Party in his image by backing MAGA candidates and those willing to push the \"big lie\" that the last election was rigged.",
    "Former President George W. Bush is reported to be attending a fundraiser in support of Georgia governor Brian Kemp in another example of recent and longtime enemies of Donald Trump publicly rallying against the MAGA president's endorsed candidate, David Perdue.",
    "During a ceremony to mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in September 2021, Bush appeared to make reference to Trump's time in the White House by stating: \"So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear, and resentment.\"",
    "\"The anti-Trumpers know that because Trump has so frequently highlighted his disdain, even hatred, for Kemp, beating Perdue will get more media coverage than beating Trump's candidates elsewhere, in Arizona, Pennsylvania, etc,\" Bullock told Newsweek.",
    "It was previously confirmed that former Vice President Mike Pence, whose relationship with Trump fell apart after the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, would be supporting Kemp as the Republican candidate during a rally held one day before the May 24 primary.",
    "Kemp, who narrowly defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams in 2018 after receiving unbridled support from Trump, has since earned the former president's ire after upholding Georgia's 2020 election results, which ruled President Joe Biden the winner.",
    "The dispute has reignited in recent years as Bush has frequently promoted the political career of Wyoming Representative Liz Cheneythe daughter of his former vice president, Dick Cheneywho has frequently opposed Trump.",
    "However, just like in the Republican gubernatorial election in Nebraska in which Trump's choice Charles Herbster lost, polls suggest that the Trump-backed candidate in Georgia may also be defeated.",
    "The Republican Governors Association has also been publicly campaigning on behalf of Kemp, meaning now there are \"multiple Establishment forces\" rallying behind the governor, Bullock told Newsweek.",
    "Trump and the Bush family have a running feud dating back to at least 2013 when Trump tweeted: \"We need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term.\"",
    "Along with Cheney, Trump has made ousting Kemp from office one of his top priorities, singling out the governor with attacks and criticism since late 2020.",
    "\"Polls showing Kemp above 50 percent and well ahead of Perdue also encourage these forces to help Kemp who looks like he will become the nominee.",
    "Bush is scheduled to appear at a Texas fundraiser on Monday for Kemp at the home of real estate developer Harlan Crow, according to Politico.",
    "In response, Trump has spent several months campaigning on behalf of Perdue, a former Georgia senator who lost his seat in January 2020.",
    "According to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll published in late April, Kemp holds an overwhelming 53 to 27 percent lead over Perdue.",
    "While announcing his endorsement of Perdue, Trump said that Kemp had \"let us down\" and \"we can't let it happen again.\"",
    "An 11Alive poll released the same month gave similar results, with Kemp leading 56 percent to 31 over Perdue.",
    "Trump would later run against Jeb Bush for president in 2016.",
    "Score one for the Establishment; zero for Trump,\" he added."
