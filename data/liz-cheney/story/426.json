    "It was back in 1973 that a little group in Omaha, Nebraska, decided that they would rescind Nebraska's ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, and it was just about half a dozen of them, but Ginni's mother was in that group,? she added, calling it a real turning point in our long battle? against the amendment, which the forum said would not celebrate womanhood? but erase it.?\nAnd then later on,? Schlafly continued, after the feminists moved on to another goal, after we beat them on E.R.A., they took up the goal of comparable worth?  a reference to a largely unsuccessful movement in the 1980s to require equal pay for men and women, which Schlafly called an effort to give us wage and price control.?\nGinni was then with the Chamber of Commerce, and she was a great help in that, and now she is a major assistant for our good friend Dick Armey,? Schlafly said, referring to the Republican congressman from Texas who was then the House majority leader.",
    "In an essay called Clarence X?? Stephen F. Smith, a Notre Dame professor and former Thomas clerk who is also Black, argues that his former boss frequently (if not invariably) seeks to demonstrate that his conservative positions on matters of race are beneficial for Black Americans, as well as legally required.?\nBut those positions are often out of step with a majority of Black Americans, and in his autobiography, Thomas laments being branded a traitor to my race? for daring to reject the ideological orthodoxy that was prescribed for blacks by liberal whites.? Such rejection of orthodoxy was evident in a 1995 concurring opinion on desegregation, when he questioned why majority-Black schools were necessarily a problem: It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior,? he wrote.",
    "As Justice Thomas once wrote, his searing 1991 confirmation, buffeted by sexual-harassment allegations, brought them closer together: The fiery trial through which we passed had the effect of melding us into one being  an amalgam, as we like to say.? At the Heritage Foundation celebration, he made it clear that bruised feelings about the very, very dark time? of his confirmation have lingered, thanking the senators who voted for me, all 52 of them.? He named supporters who had stuck by him, including Heritage's president at the time, Kay Coles James, who he said was among my prayer partners 30 years ago.? And he called his wife the rock of my life.?\nWhile no one suggests that Thomas is writing his opinions to please his wife, he does speak of a shared Thomas philosophy.",
    "Eastman then used the Thomas email group to invite those of you interested in more information? to get in touch, prompting Smith to reply that he hoped everyone agreed that the search for truth doesn't in any way justify insurrection, trying to kidnap and assassinate elected officials, attacking police officers, or making common cause with racists and anti-Semites? because such things are flatly contrary to authentic Christian faith.? (Details of Eastman's role continue to emerge, including a message he sent to Pence's top lawyer during the Capitol attack blaming the vice president for refusing to overturn the election; he repeatedly cited the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer questions from the Jan. 6 committee.)",
    "The Shelby decision is one of the biggest affronts to our democracy in modern history,? said Janai Nelson, associate director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, arguing that it unleashed a wave of voter suppression that is like what we witnessed in the Jim Crow era.? The decision freed states to enact restrictive laws, she added, that were often based on mythical justifications? of supposed voter fraud and by no coincidence disenfranchise minority voters at alarmingly disproportionate rates.?\nThat same year, Ginni Thomas turned her attention to internal battles on the right.",
    "He has charted a very radical approach to judging  it's surprising, actually, how far the court has moved in his direction.'\nMuch has changed since Thomas joined the court in 1991, when the judicial orthodoxy of the right had little traction  including the belief that Roe v. Wade, which established a right to abortion, relied on a phantom right to privacy? that isn't explicit in the Constitution, or that there was no device more destructive to the notion of equality? than affirmative action and racial quotas, as former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist once wrote in a dissenting opinion.",
    "After her stint at Heritage, Ginni Thomas ran a Washington-based constitutional studies center for Michigan's Hillsdale College, a conservative bastion that her husband has called a shining city on a hill.? She also briefly ran her own advocacy group called Liberty Central, which campaigned against a planned Islamic community center and mosque in Lower Manhattan near ground zero; that group was funded in large measure by Harlan Crow, a friend of the Thomases' and board member of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank whose work Justice Thomas has cited.",
    "The report reminded the president that Ginni Thomas had once called him a nonconservative candidate? whose populism was untethered and dangerous? and whose tactics did not bode well for a President worthy to lead this nation.? It even included a photo of her at the 2016 Republican National Convention, where she supported the effort to strip Trump of his delegates, holding her delegate badge, which was decorated with a yellow ribbon emblazoned with the words trouble maker.?\nIn the White House, she was out of bounds many times,? one of Trump's senior aides said.",
    "In fact, Thomas had advanced the argument for Shelby four years earlier, when he raised concerns about the constitutionality of preclearance in a case from Texas, arguing that there was no longer a systematic campaign to deny black citizens access to the ballot through intimidation and violence.? Four years later, in his concurring opinion in Shelby, he wrote, Our Nation has changed.?\nThe ruling was cheered on the right, with The Wall Street Journal's editorial board calling it a triumph of racial progress.? Civil rights groups were dismayed.",
    "The reporting uncovered new details on the Thomases' ascent: how Trump courted Justice Thomas; how Ginni Thomas used that courtship to gain access to the Oval Office, where her insistent policy and personnel suggestions so aggravated aides that one called her a wrecking ball? while others put together an opposition-research-style report on her that was obtained by The Times; and the extent to which Justice Thomas flouted judicial-ethics guidance by participating in events hosted by conservative organizations with matters before the court.",
    "He delivered an emotional eulogy for his friend, a longtime ideological ally, even if Scalia had once referred to his own brand of originalism as fainthearted.? For this, I feel quite inadequate to the task,? Thomas said, adding that the two had many buck-each-other-up visits, too many to count.? He recounted gleefully chiding Scalia for excoriating an opinion he came across: Nino, you wrote it.? For years, Thomas was overshadowed by his more voluble colleague, but a reconsideration followed.",
    "We're trying to get these rsums through, and we're being blocked.' I appreciated her energy, but a lot of these people couldn't pass background checks.? Many of the people she pushed, another former Trump aide said, had legitimate background issues, security-clearance issues or had done a lot of business overseas.?\nThe president continued to allow Ginni Thomas access, telling aides that if she were in the White House visiting with other officials, she was welcome to drop by to see him.",
    "Brigitte Gabriel, a Council for National Policy stalwart who once said that every practicing Muslim is a radical Muslim?  and whose activism Ginni Thomas once praised in a glowing Daily Caller column  called Justice Thomas the real chief justice? during December oral arguments and tweeted a doctored photo in which every justice had his face with the caption: This would be a Supreme Court with Courage.?\nI love calling it the Thomas court,? said Helgi Walker, the former Thomas clerk.",
    "Dustin Stockton, an organizer who worked with Women for America First, which held the permit for the Ellipse rally, said he was told that Ginni Thomas played a peacemaking role between feuding factions of rally organizers so that there wouldn't be any division around January 6.?\nThe way it was presented to me was that Ginni was uniting these different factions around a singular mission on January 6,? said Stockton, who previously worked for Bannon.",
    "This article draws on hours of recordings and internal documents from groups affiliated with the Thomases; dozens of interviews with the Thomases' classmates, friends, colleagues and critics, as well as more than a dozen Trump White House aides and supporters and some of Justice Thomas's former clerks; and an archive of Council for National Policy videos and internal documents provided by an academic researcher in Australia, Brent Allpress.",
    "Anderson, who donated to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, wasn't happy with his grandson's choices,? Kevin Merida, now the executive editor of The Los Angeles Times, and Michael A. Fletcher wrote in a 2007 biography, Supreme Discomfort.? The authors quoted Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Black former clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer whom Biden is now considering for the vacancy being created by Breyer's retirement.",
    "When the Batphone rings and it's Commissioner Ginni Gordon, otherwise known as Ginni Thomas, of course you have to show up,? said Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent turned popular pro-Trump radio host, after receiving one of Thomas's Impact Awards in 2017. I can't say enough about Ginni,? Bongino told the audience at the event, which included the Fox News pundit Sean Hannity and Ed Meese, a Reagan administration attorney general.",
    "Justice Thomas lamented at Notre Dame that a notable pessimism about the state of our country? had taken hold, with some Americans believing that America is a racist and irredeemable nation? and seeking to cancel our founders.?\nThere are still people who have faith in the country and what it stands for, but it was on the road and beyond the East Coast elites that the couple found those Americans, at least in Justice Thomas's telling.",
    "Action, he wrote that legislatures have the constitutional authority to determine how federal elections are held, yet in 2020, nonlegislative officials in various States took it upon themselves to set the rules instead.?\nHe called the refusal by his colleagues to hear the case inexplicable,? arguing that allegations of systemic maladministration, voter suppression, or fraud? go to the heart of public confidence in election results.",
    "There's always a temptation, I think, to go beyond,? he said, adding that when judges begin to venture into political, legislative or executive-branch lanes,? they are asking for trouble.? He laid out the consequences: I think the court was thought to be the least dangerous branch, and we may have become the most dangerous.?\nBut more than any other sitting justice, Thomas has stoked concerns of a hyperpartisan court.",
    "A few years later, after he was appointed by Reagan to head the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he would complain that Black civil rights leaders bitch, bitch, bitch, moan and moan, whine and whine.?\nThomas venerated his grandfather, Myers Anderson, who was as influential in his life as his wife's mother was in hers, and titled his memoir My Grandfather's Son.? But the relationship was often fractious.",
    "Early participants drew from a number of hard-line interest groups, including Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch and Ken Blackwell of the Family Research Council, as well as Leonard Leo and Allen West, an outspoken former Florida congressman, and a number of right-wing journalists, including Mark Tapscott, then the executive editor of The Washington Examiner.",
    "Thomas and her co-authors said the investigation brings disrespect to our country's rule of law? and legal harassment to private citizens who have done nothing wrong,? adding that they would begin a nationwide movement to add citizens' voices to this effort.?\nA few weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled 8 to 1 to allow the release of records from the Trump White House related to the Jan. 6 attack.",
    "But there's an underbelly of pain, and they turn it against other people.?\nClarence Thomas has always maintained that he had to be talked into accepting an appointment to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit when he was nominated as a federal judge in 1989. I was minding my business,? he said, recounting the story in his remarks at the Heritage celebration.",
    "During a presentation in 2019, she warned that conservatives and Republicans are tired of being the oppressed minority,? adding that they were being falsely vilified, slandered and defamed as extremists and bigots and haters.? The left, she said, was making it justifiable and normalized to fight us, to hurt us, to kill us even.? For her, this was a fight decades in the making.",
    "Instead, he took the only job offer he received and went to work for Missouri's Republican attorney general, John Danforth, and discovered the writings of the Black conservative Thomas Sowell, who assailed affirmative action as undercutting self-reliance; Thomas wrote that he felt like a thirsty man gulping down a glass of cool water? to see his own beliefs articulated.",
    "In 2010, shortly after news broke of Ginni Thomas's call to Hill, Lillian McEwen, a former assistant U.S. attorney who dated Clarence Thomas for several years after his separation from his first wife, spoke out: He was always actively watching the women he worked with to see if they could be potential partners,? she told The Washington Post in support of Hill's account.",
    "In a Dec. 2 speech at the White House, the president falsely claimed that millions of votes were cast illegally in swing states alone? and said he hoped the Supreme Court of the United States will see it? and will do what's right for our country, because our country cannot live with this kind of an election.?\nThe Thomases have long posed a unique quandary in Washington.",
    "What's that mean?'? She was, after all, a former attorney for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a bastion of Big Oil, and has fumed aloud that kids are being turned into robots for climate change.? But her husband had an explanation, she said: He goes, We both tilt at windmills.'?\nThe death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016 left a void on the court and for Justice Thomas.",
    "You can quote me on that.?\nGinni Thomas posted a disclaimer after the protests devolved into an insurrection  [Note: written before violence in US Capitol]?  but she had also lamented Trump's loss in a message to Thomas Clerk World,? a private email group used by Ginni Thomas and former clerks and their spouses that is typically reserved for more anodyne pleasantries.",
    "When Schlafly lost a bid to become president of the National Federation of Republican Women in 1967, Marjorie Lamp withdrew from the organization and called the voting rigged.? She ran unsuccessfully for the Nebraska Legislature in 1972 and was a 1976 Reagan delegate, railing against Gerald Ford's lack of leadership; Reagan people are more hard-core,? she once said.",
    "It instructed members to pressure Republican lawmakers into challenging the election results and appointing alternate slates of electors: Demand that they not abandon their Constitutional responsibilities during a time such as this.?\nSuch a plan, if carried out successfully, would have almost certainly landed before the Supreme Court  and Ginni Thomas's husband.",
    "There was a fierce determination I sensed from him, that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could.?\nThomas got his law degree from Yale but stuck a 15-cent cigar sticker to the frame of his diploma after failing to get a big law job  such firms, he would write, attributed his academic pedigree to preferential treatment.",
    "He doesn't agree with everything, but they work it out privately.?\nHill was taken aback and made the call public: She can't ask for an apology without suggesting that I did something wrong, and that is offensive.? Hill had not been the only woman to level accusations against Clarence Thomas: At the time of his confirmation hearing, another former E.E.O.C.",
    "They were featured on the event program, and documents show that Ginni Thomas urged attendees to come hear her and my amazing husband? in a personal letter that was part of the event's promotional materials, adding, God can use such an occasion for encouragement and insights!? (Full registration for the group's annual conference cost $350 as of 2019.)",
    "By doing nothing,? Thomas continued, we invite further confusion and erosion of voter confidence.? He did concede in a footnote that the 2020 presidential election had been free from strong evidence of systemic fraud.?\nThough the battle for the presidency is over, the Thomases are winning in the war for the courts  and, some would argue, the country.",
    "(Asked about Thomas's mediating role, Kremer's daughter Kylie Jane Kremer, the executive director of Women for America First, did not answer that question, instead painting Stockton as someone who makes inaccurate and attention-seeking statements.? Martin similarly avoided the question, issuing a statement that condemned the violence at the Capitol.",
    "In the weeks that followed Jan. 6, as public condemnation of the insurrection grew to include some Republican leaders like Senator Mitch McConnell, the Council for National Policy circulated in its newsletter another previously unreported memo, written by one of its members, that outlined strategies to make the Capitol riot seem more palatable.",
    "Now, in books and notes that have been released, it seems that Justice Scalia was just as influenced by Justice Thomas as Justice Thomas was by Justice Scalia.?\nThomas has warm relationships with many of his court colleagues; he called Ruth Bader Ginsburg simply a joy to work with? and was often seen helping her navigate the courtroom's steps.",
    "Behind the scenes, Eastman was advising Trump and his campaign on a new proposal to change the outcome of the election: Vice President Mike Pence, he asserted, could refuse to accept swing-state votes and send them back to the state legislatures when he presided over the certification of the election in a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6.",
    "report was leaked, Anita Hill, a law professor who worked under Thomas at the Department of Education and the E.E.O.C., testified that he made numerous unwelcome advances, persisted in workplace conversations about his sexual prowess,? described graphic pornography and said he found a pubic hair on a cola can and asked who had put it there.",
    "78, which laid out the role of American courts, Alexander Hamilton wrote that they were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature? and keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority.?

    "Ginni Thomas personally co-moderated a panel called The Pro-Life Movement on Offense? that laid out strategies to energize low turnout pro-life voters? and persuadable Democrats and Hispanics? by talking to them about late-term abortion, taxpayer funding of abortion, and the Supreme Court,? one of the slides in the presentation read.",

Clarke, a Black former Milwaukee County sheriff whose oversight of a local jail was the subject of multiple investigations and lawsuits, whom she supported for a top post at the Department of Homeland Security.",
    "At the Heritage tribute, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, called Thomas a legal titan? and the brightest possible north star.? Playing to the crowd of nearly 250 of his party's elite, he dryly asked: What could I, Mitch McConnell, possibly know about a notable leader who is parsimonious with his public statements?",
    "The call to action was titled Election Results and Legal Battles: What Now?? Shared in the days after the 2020 presidential election, it urged the members of an influential if secretive right-wing group to contact legislators in three of the swing states that tipped the balance for Joe Biden  Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania.",
    "The future justice flatly rejected the allegations, calling the public inquiry a high-tech lynching for uppity Blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas.?\nAsked during the hearing whether he wanted to withdraw, he said, I'd rather die.? He did not watch Hill's testimony.",
    "The narrative of the Left has already taken hold.? He added, The words Voter ID' are already lost & equated with racism.?

    "In 1991, one of Ginni Thomas's aunts told The Washington Post that the future justice was so nice, we forgot he was Black,? adding, He treated her so well, all of his other qualities made up for his being Black.?\nThomas had custody of a teenage son, Jamal, from his previous marriage to Kathy Ambush, his college girlfriend.",
    "I think in the long run, when you look at the impact on the conservative movement and the principles we hold dear, I think her and her husband stand toe to toe.?\nThe federal judicial code of conduct, adopted in 1973, restricts judges from being a speaker, a guest of honor or featured on the program? at fund-raising events.",
    "The document, obtained by The Times, detailed how Crystal Clanton, a friend of Ginni Thomas's whose name had been advanced, had been forced out from Turning Point USA, a conservative student group on whose advisory board Ginni Thomas once served, after The New Yorker reported that she wrote in a text: I HATE BLACK PEOPLE.",
    "It's very similar to what happened with the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages,? he said of the justice's approach, adding that the church and its institutions did their work during that time, laying the foundations for future Catholic thinking and Catholic thought to sort of grow the church and preserve its traditions.",
    "Action meetings and documents targeted Democratic strategies that make it easier to vote, including the practice of civic groups' gathering ballot applications, derided by many on the right as ballot harvesting.? Months later, the Supreme Court upheld an Arizona ban on the practice, with Thomas in the 6-to-3 majority.",
    "New reporting also shows just how blurred the lines between the couple's interests became during the effort to overturn the 2020 election, which culminated in the rally held at the Ellipse, just outside the White House grounds, aimed at stopping Congress from certifying the state votes that gave Joe Biden his victory.",

    "She warned in a local paper that if Jimmy Carter was elected, we'd be heading toward socialism.?

    "The first time people were hearing about him were these salacious allegations.?

    "It is a joy, an absolute joy, to be able to stand here and celebrate this moment,? he said, not because of me but because of you all and what we're trying to defend in this great country.?\nIf Thomas has been laying the groundwork for a conservative revolution, so has his wife, who once worked at Heritage herself.",

    "He was championed by Danforth, by then a senator, who said on the Senate floor: I hope that people would not attack Clarence Thomas because of some stereotype of what they think a Black lawyer should believe.?\nThurgood Marshall announced his retirement from the Supreme Court in 1991, and President George H.W.",

Returning to the battle at hand, the Kavanaugh fight, she said, Even if he gets in  I believe he'll get in, I'm hoping he gets in, but they're not going to leave him alone.? It was clear it was personal: They're trying to impeach him.",
    "And Roe v. Wade appears likely to be hollowed out, if not overturned: The court, with Thomas as the lone dissenter, recently allowed abortion providers the right to challenge a Texas anti-abortion law, though a conservative majority, joined by Thomas, declined to block the law's enforcement in the meantime.",
    "It's very exciting,? Ginni Thomas said during a 2018 Council for National Policy meeting, the fact that there's a resistance on our side to their side.?\nHer role became increasingly public in the Trump era, when she started emceeing an annual awards ceremony celebrating some of the best-known Trump allies.",
    "We need a federal judiciary full of men and women who are as bright as Justice Thomas, as expertly trained as Justice Thomas, but most importantly, most importantly, as committed to total unflinching judicial independence.? But in Thomas's own remarks, he alluded to the shared purpose of those gathered.",
    "While the executive holds the sword? and the legislature commands the purse,? the judiciary will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them.?\nThe Supreme Court must rely on public acceptance of its decisions.",
    "Every time, without fail, Justice Thomas writes a separate, concise opinion to cut through the 50-year tangle of made-up tests and shifting standards and calmly reminds everybody that the whole house of cards lacks a constitutional foundation.?\nJustice Thomas does not break, or bend, or bow,? he said.",
    "She started by leading the prayer.? When others began speaking, the aide remembers talk of the transsexual agenda? and parents chopping off their children's breasts.?

    "For the future justice, conservatism was part of an ideological journey, much of it forged at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., where he was among a small group of Black men that did the difficult work of integrating the institution in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",

    "I think, and I've said this only a few times publicly, one of the best things that could have happened to me was to have gone through the kind of confirmation I went through,? he told the conservative activists at the Eagle Forum in 1996. I am the freest person on the court.",
