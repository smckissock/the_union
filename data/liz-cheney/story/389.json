    "This is a slight deviation from \"a game plan that McCarthy has repeatedly adopted over the past year with the more extreme elements present in the House GOP conference: engage controversial members privately but avoid alienating them with any public criticism,\" since he needs their support to become House speaker, The Hill reports.",
    "https://t.co/9n4HZAaSam https://t.co/M2NXg0QKHY\n John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) March 1, 2022\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee is still actively supporting the re-election campaigns of Greene and Gosar, journalist Judd Legum noted Monday.",
    "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) distanced himself Monday from the \"unacceptable\" participation of two GOP lawmakers, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) and Rep. Paul Gosar (Ariz.), in a white nationalist event in Florida on Friday.",
    "Greene  who proposed forming an \"Anglo-Saxon\" America First Caucus with Gosar last year, before House GOP leaders stepped in  defended her participation in the conference from \"the Pharisees in the Republican Party\" and their criticism.",
    "At one point during the America First Political Action Conference, organizer Nick Fuentes backed Russia's Ukraine invasion, saying \"they're going on about Russia and Vladimir Putin is Hitler  and they say that's not a good thing.\"",
    "\"I won't cancel others in the conservative movement, even if I find some of their statements tasteless, misguided or even repulsive at times,\" she said.",
    "\"While that strategy helps limit public GOP infighting in the moment, it also means that extremism routinely goes unchallenged by top party leaders.\"",
    "McCarthy has no such qualms about publicly censuring the two Republicans who sit on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
    "One of them, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), is retiring next year, but McCarthy is backing the primary challenger to Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.).",
    "So the conservative magazine National Review asked McCarthy's campaign if he also plans to back a primary challenger to Greene.",
    "\"The party should not be associated, any time, any place, with somebody who is anti-Semitic\" or leads chants for Putin.",
    "Liz and I can get censured, they're going to get help up as the future leaders of the party.\"",
    "@NRO sent an email posing that question to a McCarthy campaign aide earlier this evening.",
    "\"What I think we should do is kick them out of the party,\" Kingziner said Monday.",
    "\"There's no place in our party for any of this,\" McCarthy told reporters.",
    "Earlier this month, McCarthy endorsed Liz Cheney's primary challenger.",
    "Right before Greene took the stage, Fuentes led a chant for Putin.",
    "He said he will \"have a discussion\" with Greene and Gosar.",
    "Will McCarthy back Greene's primary challenger?",
    "\"What do I think we're going to do?",
    "No response yet.",
    "Nothing."
