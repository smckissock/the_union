    "Two years ago, she begged for my endorsement and then she pledged to be America First.?\nHowever, Trump said, Mace went to D.C., where she started attacking Republicans and [held] a fundraiser for wacky Liz Cheney.? Yet, Mace has attempted to position herself as one of Trump's earliest supporters but has yet to explain why she believes Trump chose to endorse her primary challenger, Katie Arrington, instead.",
    "Katie Arrington, on the other hand, is liked and respected and a true Republican,? he declared, continuing to blast Mace:\nAs Breitbart News detailed:\nAs Breitbart News previously chronicled, Katie Arrington won the nomination during the 2018 midterm elections when she defeated Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC) with the former president's endorsement.",

    "A recent survey for Arrington's campaign suggested that Mace's lead deteriorates once voters learn that Trump endorsed Arrington.",
    "Her opponent, Katie Arrington, is wonderful and will do a much better job for both South Carolina and the Republican Party.",
    "Notably, every candidate Trump endorsed in Texas's Republican primaries won or went on to a runoff.",
    "You'll need to ask him,? she told the State when asked about Trump's refusal to endorse her.",
