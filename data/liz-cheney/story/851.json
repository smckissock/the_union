    "And when you look at what former President Trump continues to do to this day in terms of trying to undermine our belief in our Democratic process, in terms of trying to undermine the rule of law, in terms of trying to find local officials who will help him do that, one of the really important lessons we learned on January 6th was how important it was that we had a few individuals who stood up.",
    "We need to make sure we're following mitigation strategies, that we're supporting our educators by providing a safe learning environment, we're providing vaccination for our students as young as 5, so that the whole school community is safe, and we're providing surveillance testing to make sure that, if someone is sick, that they stay home.",
    "LIZ CHENEY: Look, I think that if -- if what he has been saying since he left office is any indication, former President Trump is likely, again this week, to make the same false claims about the election that he knows to be false, and the same false claims about the election that he knows caused violence on January 6th.",
    "We don't often talk about numbers that small, but what we have seen here is that it doesn't take large numbers of people to feel that way, and then that in turn leads to that lessening confidence or that anticipation that more violence might arise, because they know that those folks are out there -- Margaret.",
    "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:\nFormer FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona\nRepresentative Liz Cheney\nRepresentative Adam Schiff\nUniversity of Chicago professor Robert Pape\nClick here to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\"",
    "You know, the goal is to have students and staff be safe in their classrooms with the use of the mitigation strategies, with a whole host of strategies that we have now that we didn't have when we were having these conversations in March 2020 and to open the school year the previous year.",
    "And we've seen now people who were in the Capitol, people who have been arrested because of their activities on that day, they themselves have told us in court filings, they've told us on social media, we've seen it on videos, that they were here because Donald Trump told them to be here.",
    "We had individuals at the Department of Justice before January 6th who stood up to the president, who said absolutely not, we will not claim that this election was stolen, who told him the truth, and we had local officials in the party, the Republican Party, who did the same.",
    "I think one of the really important things that our committee has to do is lay these facts out for the American people so that they really have a sense of the truth of what happened that day, and so that they inform us in terms of our legislative activity going forward.",
    "But we shouldn't be distracted from the fact that, yes, while there were things that could and should have been done to protect the Capitol that day, the primary lever, instrument, the cause of that violence was the promulgation of a big lie by the former president.",
    "In terms of the actual violent attack on the Capitol, how much expectation of violence was there, how much was that part of the plan, either spontaneously or in terms of any predisposition towards violence that day, that is still a matter under deep investigation.",
    "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: A year after the violent attack on the Capitol by hundreds of Americans determined to stop the certification of the 2020 election,a new CBS News poll finds that day still has a lingering effect on the national psyche.",
    "And right now there are far too many Republicans who are trying to enable the former president, embrace the former president, look the other way and hope that the former president goes away, trying to obstruct the activities of this committee.",
    "I think places that have been hard-hit early, like the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast, New England, Florida, parts of the Pacific Northwest, may be two weeks away from peaking, but the rest of the country probably faces a hard bmonth ahead of us.",
    "And I look forward to the opportunity to continue to help the American people see the facts about what happened, and to continue to make the case at home about the kind of representation that we need in Washington for the people of Wyoming.",
    "You know, imagine a man who, while the violent assault was underway, while he was watching television, watching it unfold, not telling his supporters to stop and go home, instead was sending out a tweet saying that Mike Pence was a coward.",
    "I think, with the tools we have, with prudence, with the knowledge we have about how to control this infection in those settings, you can do pretty --\na pretty good job of trying to control large outbreaks, certainly within the classroom.",
    "You know, if you think, Margaret, he could have simply walked a few feet to the White House Briefing Room, he could have gone immediately on live television and asked his supporters to stop what was happening, ask them to go home.",
    "There was, of course, the lies being promulgated by the former president, but also efforts with local elections officials and state legislators, efforts at the Justice Department, and, of course, the violent attack on January 6th.",
    "Further, if we look at their relationship to the militia groups, so only 13 percent of those who broke into the Capitol on January 6th were members of militia groups, like the Oath Keepers, or extremist groups like the Proud Boys.",
    "And we hope to be able to tell the story to the country so that they understand it isn't just about that one day, January 6th, but all that led up to it, what happened on that day, and the continuing danger going forward.",
    "Over the course of the year, we have seen some movement among Republicans within those who disapprove, a little bit of softening of that, from the strongly disapprove, a little more into this somewhat disapprove category.",
    "And I can tell you that -- that the single most important thing, though, is to ensure that -- that Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee, and that he certainly is not anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again.",
    "(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Wyoming Republican Liz Cheney shares few political views with California Democrat Adam Schiff, but they are working together on the committee tasked with investigating the January 6 attack.",
    "MIGUEL CARDONA: I know we've had an Omicron surge, but I still believe very firmly and very passionately, not only as an educator, but as a parent, that our students belong in the classroom, and we can do it safely.",
    "Over half of the 700 who broke into the Capitol, who have been arrested so far for breaking into the Capitol, are business owners, CEOs, from white- collar occupations, doctors, lawyers, architects, and accountants.",
    "ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we have gotten tens of thousands of documents and have hundreds of witnesses, so we're trying to get information in various means and forms so that we're not solely dependent on that litigation.",
    "This is very different than we're used to seeing from right-wing extremists where typically 25 percent, 30 percent of right-ring violent offenders are unemployed, and virtually none are CEOs or business owners.",
    "There was some experimental evidence that the FDA put out about a week ago showing that, in laboratory studies, there appeared to be decreased sensitivity in terms of the test's ability to detect this virus.",
    "And this week on Face the Nation, we begin our third year of COVID-19 with a massive spike in Omicron cases and a still fragile democracy, as we near the first anniversary of the January 6 Capitol attack.",
    "Well, there's a lot of folks on the Republican side, four in 10, who think that, rather than Trump supporters who entered the Capitol, that it was left- leaning groups pretending to be Trump supporters.",
    "He -- he, instead, we know, had the motivation, at the same time the violent assault was happening, he's watching television, he's also calling at least one senator urging delay of the electoral vote.",
    "But that issue, that is, what was the White House's role in what happened on the 6th that led to the first violent attack in a century and a half, if not longer, is at the core of our investigation.",
    "MIGUEL CARDONA: But it's the expectation that, through the use of American Rescue Plan funds, we address some of the shortages in staffing for the long-term benefit of our students and our families.",
    "Which means, as we go through the 2022 elections season, it's crucial to have dialogue with our political leaders, our community leaders, especially the White House, over this new empirical reality.",
    "So the combination, I think, of very strong sanctions, and I certainly have no problem of going after Putin personally, but I think more that the sector- sized sanctions will be the most important.",
    "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, we asked about a range of issues, not just elections, and asked, well, are these important enough that violence could be justified, again, if undertaken perhaps by others?",
    "Further, when we look at the key characteristic of why some counties and not others, what we see is the counties that sent the insurrectionists are the counties losing the most white population.",
    "The committee has firsthand testimony that President Trump was sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office watching on television as the Capitol was assaulted, as the violence occurred.",
    "We still don't have tests widely available to the schools, so that they can use these tests for tests-to- stay policies to prevent large quarantines when are cases diagnosed in the classroom.",
    "The Omicron variant, fueled by holiday gatherings and spreading with breathtaking speed, particularly among younger Americans, is frustrating and worrisome to a nation that has had enough.",
    "When we have masks and when we're ensuring that, if students are sick, they stay home, when we ensure that the people round them are vaccinated, we're protecting those children as well.",
    "Well, that's not what our studies of the January 6th -- those who broke into the Capitol on January 6th shows, or the -- our studies of the insurrectionist sentiments in the country.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things that we've seen in CBS polling is that there is just a hard percentage of the population that believes what the\nformer president is claiming.",
    "And this new strain could have a predilection, again, for the upper airway, which could be a bigger challenge in young kids because of the way that it binds to the airway cells.",
    "One of the things that the committee is looking at, from the perspective of our legislative purpose, is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty.",
    "If it's a conservative court, it will not disturb the decisions below, which I think have clearly held that Congress has a right to this information under these circumstances.",
    "But that's why I'm asking what you've asked the teachers union to do, because, out in Chicago, in Massachusetts, in Connecticut, you have teachers saying they don't feel safe.",
    "MARK STRASSMANN: More ominously, those numbers could be fractional, driving this epidemic, people who are undiagnosed, either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but untested.",
    "(Begin VT)\nMARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): A new year in our COVID chronicles welcomed by maskless Floridians with this super-spreaders jamboree, risky behavior, even reckless.",
    "And one of the things that was chilling to me was that you found the majority of those who attacked were not affiliated with any organized militia, they were everyday people.",
    "I don't think you're going to start to see a national peak until we get into February, because there's parts of the country that really haven't been hard-hit by Omicron yet.",
    "And you get a range, from civil rights, to gun policies, to labor issues, among others, where you get 20-odd percent, even 30-odd percent who say that it might be justified.",
    "But we intend to use every effort to get out the full facts and expose them to the American people and -- and take legislative action to protect the country going forward.",
    "MIGUEL CARDONA: Since the beginning of the pandemic, even before I was secretary of education, when I was serving as commissioner here in Connecticut, we worked together.",
    "And so, parts of the country that were affected earlier, like New York, probably are going to start to peak in the next two weeks, other parts within the next four weeks.",
    "It's not about the merits of litigation so much as it is depriving Congress and the American people of information they believe I assume would be incriminating to them.",
    "LIZ CHENEY: Look, I think that -- that we're in a situation where people have got to understand the danger of President Trump and the danger that he posed on that day.",
    "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think, certainly, the February time frame is appropriate in terms of when we're going to pass through this Omicron wave across the United States.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to button up what you said earlier, though, that your -- your teachers and your kids need to be wearing high-quality masks, not cloth ones.",
    "I think that it is, indeed, very concerning given what we know happened in the lead-up to the 6th, and what the committee is finding out about the events of that day.",
    "And what we want to emphasize here is that it's not that people say that they themselves would undertake it, but whether they might be OK with it if other people did.",
    "I still, frankly, don't understand the full motivation for why, why now he's doing this, but he certainly appears intent on it, unless we can persuade him otherwise.",
    "We shouldn't be doing preemptive school closures, in my opinion, but there will be situations where we have reactive school closures, when there are large outbreaks.",
    "Given the test-to-stay policies now, can we be confident that antigen tests are catching the virus and that, if your kid takes one, they can safely go to school?",
    "But when it does go before the Supreme Court, we well get a sense of whether that court is a conservative court or whether it has become just a bipartisan court.",
    "So when we look at the counties that the 700 who broke into the Capitol came from, where they live, what we see is over half live in counties that Joe Biden won.",
    "Now, there are answers for why the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security failed to see it as cheerleader as they should have, and we're looking into that.",
    "But -- but beyond that, the knowledge that, in fact, we will move more NATO assets closer to Russia, not further away, if they once again bring war to Ukraine.",
    "Who are these individuals, and what can we learn from their backgrounds that can help us understand the political violence that we saw that day on January 6th?",
    "Particularly between those within the Trump White House, political operatives, and the 725 people that the -- that have been charged by the Justice Department?",
    "And in some there is concern that Republican-controlled legislatures could be able to change certification of an election if they don't like the outcome of it.",
    "We have had now - - if you just think about, for example, what we know now about what the former president was doing on the 6th while the attack was underway.",
    "This is going to go to the Supreme Court in terms of determining whether some of the records from the Trump administration will be released to your committee.",
    "Teachers unions, including the largest one in your home state of Connecticut, have said they want a delayed return because they don't have access to testing.",
    "And it does appear now, based on a lot of experimental evidence that we've gotten just in the last two weeks, that this is a milder form of the coronavirus.",
    "So, it's -- it's important to lose -- that we don't lose sight of the real motivating cause here and -- and not just focus on the security of the building.",
    "And their media sources of those 21 million, they come from -- 42 percent of the 21 million, their main media source is Fox News, Newsmax, and One America.",
    "Was there just a failure of imagination in terms of too much focus on militias and organized groups versus sort of a defused threat of political violence?",
    "ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think that it would require enormous sanctions on Russia to deter what appears to be a very likely Russian invasion of Ukraine again.",
    "He has both acted to obstruct the actions of the committee, but he's also, on a couple of occasions, said that he's willing to come talk to the committee.",
    "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look now at the 725 people who have been charged for their roles in the attack on the Capitol.",
    "I also think that a powerful deterrent is the understanding that if they do invade, it is going to bring NATO closer to Russia, not push it farther away.",
    "Superintendents today are getting phone calls, learning that some of their schools may have 5 to 10 percent of their staff not available due to COVID-19.",
    "And we had to communicate the importance of in-person learning, but also in making sure that our educators are safe and have the support that they need.",
    "And I think nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia\nhas ever seen will deter him, and that's exactly what we need to do with our allies.",
    "I have been looking at pediatric hospitalizations at this record high and concerned about sending my son back into a preschool even with a mask on.",
    "So, I think certainly, by the end of February, we will be through this, if businesses need a guide of when prevalence is\ngoing to start to decline.",
    "So, we really don't know whether or not that experimental evidence is suggestive that these tests may not be as sensitive at picking up the virus.",
    "Parents spend hours in line for testing, often confused about school guidance and protocols that vary district to district, even school to school.",
    "MIGUEL CARDONA: What I'm saying is that we are working with districts to set up systems that maybe were not set up when there was a dip in spread.",
    "So are you saying that the federal government can ensure that every school district in the country has an adequate supply of testing this week?",
    "So what we're seeing in our surveys, our national surveys, of the 21 million in the insurrectionist movement is a mass of combustible material.",
    "The one group that that may be a problem for is very young kids, very young children, toddlers, who have trouble with upper airway infections.",
    "Once again, if you're using the antigen test to protect a high-risk setting, the best approach is to do serial testing over a period of time.",
    "We've seen that the durability of the vaccines in young children, particularly 12 to 16, has been more robust than what we've seen in adults.",
    "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to a Democrat on that January 6th committee, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.",
    "Again, if he makes those same claims, he's doing it with complete understanding and knowledge of what those claims have caused in the past.",
    "Because you have oversight in your intelligence committee role, I want to know to what degree you think this was an intelligence failure?",
    "MAN: If you're going to have people getting together, and you have children that are unvaccinated, they will be the bullseye for Omicron.",
    "One, that Joe Biden is an illegitimate president, and, two, that the use of force to restore Donald Trump to the presidency is justified.",
    "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, the manufacturers feel very confident that their tests, the major market tests, are detecting this virus.",
    "What you're saying by closing schools preemptively, and even colleges, is that you can't possibly control outbreaks in those settings.",
    "It's not so much that people think that violence can itself be acceptable, but they fear that their opponents might do that, or worse.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has said that -- that he believes racism was a key part of the attack on the Capitol on January 6th.",
    "And this is important because we're so used to thinking of right-wing extremism or really extremism in general, as part of the fringe.",
    "That's why it was critically important with the American Rescue Plan to\nhave funds available to provide that safety that they needed.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: But then you are seeing school districts already go through closures, more than 2,000 so far, according to Burbio.",
    "And there's 12 percent of the country that say he should be fighting right now to get back into the office before the next election.",
    "As his supporters said, who came and attacked the Capitol that day, they felt like they were following the president's instructions.",
    "It's so high, Atlanta Public Schools just decided to hold virtual classes this week, when the kids come back on Tuesday -- Margaret.",
    "But at the end of the day, I am also incredibly privileged to be able to stand up and defend the Constitution of the United States.",
    "We know what works, and I believe, even with Omicron, our default should be in person learning for all students across the country.",
    "ROBERT PAPE: Well, we can see their media consumption from surveys that we've done after our studies of who broke into the Capitol.",
    "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, who joins us from Meriden, Connecticut.",
    "The FDA is expected to green-light these booster shots for 12-to-15-year- olds and the immunocompromised in the younger age group.",
    "(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But what else can be done, with nearly 15 percent of eligible adults still refusing to get vaccinated?",
    "I think that the American people, again, in particular the Republican Party, you know, we, as Republicans, have a choice to make.",
    "Very quickly, do you fear these diplomatic talks are just building a pretext for Russia to say they have no choice but to invade?",
    "That, coupled with what we know is going to help, having a shorter quarantine period, we do believe our schools can remain open.",
    "Two years and two days ago, the WHO received the first formal word from China about a mysterious new virus circulating in Wuhan.",
    "America is kicking off 2022 with a repeat from last year, a coronavirus crisis that's going to get worse before it gets better.",
    "That we will move more NATO assets closer to Russia, that it will have the opposite impact of what Putin is trying to achieve.",
    "Seven out of 10 Republicans still believe President Biden's illegitimate, 66 percent believe there was widespread voter fraud.",
    "ADAM SCHIFF: Well, this is really a focal point of our investigation, and that is, what was the role of the former president?",
    "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we clearly need to focus on the hospitalization rate and how many people are becoming severely ill.",
    "His latest study on political violence has some surprising findings about those arrested for their role in the insurrection.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: In a number of state capitals around the country, in 19 different states, election laws are being changed.",
    "Well, that dovetails with this right-wing conspiracy theory that used to be part of the fringe called the great replacement.",
    "I remember having to reopen schools before we had vaccines for any children and before we had the science that we have now.",
    "And a lot of our election laws, say Georgia or Texas, the counting of the vote has been more politicized than ever before.",
    "And I'm confident that the people of Wyoming will not choose loyalty to one man, one man as dangerous as Donald Trump is.",
    "Then: We're coming up on a year after the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, that devastating day for democracy.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we also know that there are staff shortages because people are actually getting sick, right?",
    "To put that in perspective, we have one death from flu and the pediatric population last year and so far two this year.",
    "It could protect better through droplet transmission, something like the flu, but not something like this coronavirus.",
    "I think the court understands, and the courts have been moving with great alacrity, that really delay is the strategy.",
    "And then you look at, well, is it justifiable for candidates or elected officials to do things like call for violence?",
    "We have testing that's a different pool of tests than what we're seeing now, where we see people scrambling for tests.",
    "We're working really hard to make sure that they have access to tests and that they have resources to provide testing.",
    "What is your message to the parents of a kindergartner or a preschooler when they send their child into the classroom?",
    "And we're seeing districts implementing strategies now to do surveillance testing to ensure that classrooms are safe.",
    "Sixty-eight percent think it's a sign of more violence to come, and two- thirds think democracy itself is threatened.",
    "So, that could be a challenge for young kids, and we are seeing rising hospitalizations among that pediatric segment.",
    "Well,\nwe're moving into a highly volatile 2022 election season, where there could be many sparks at the local levels.",
    "Only 10 percent of the 21 million are getting their news mainly from right-wing social media, like Gab or Telegraph.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if these people believed in what they were doing, who are they getting their information from?",
    "So, over a period of time when we've done a very good job protecting children generally from respiratory infections.",
    "That is, the failure to see all the evidence that was out there to be seen for the propensity of violence that day.",
    "LIZ CHENEY: Look, I am absolutely honored and privileged to be able to represent the people of Wyoming in Congress.",
    "Well, that idea now is voiced by mainstream political leaders, by mainstream media figures, embraced full throttle.",
    "You know, we went from 47 percent of our schools open in person in January of last year to 99 percent in December.",
    "And this is why I was mentioning that -- is the same message I have had to parents for the last\nyear-and-a-half.",
    "While any individual test could miss the infection, if you're doing serial testing, you're likely to pick it up.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told me back in November that there is no excuse for schools to be anything but in person.",
    "But, of course, it's the hope of Donald Trump and his acolytes that they can delay until they can deny justice.",
    "Think of it as like dry wood that could be set off like -- from a lightning strike or a spark, as in wildfires.",
    "If there is a lengthy delay, if the Supreme Court hears this out, how negatively will that impact your work?",
    "You have one of his biggest donors, Peter Thiel, a billionaire, throwing money behind your primary opponent.",
    "Republican Liz Cheney of Wyoming is the vice chair of the committee, and she joins us now from Capitol Hill.",
    "We have made a lot of progress fighting that virus since those terrifying early days of the global pandemic.",
    "MARK STRASSMANN: Across COVID America last week, almost 400 children a day were hospitalized for the virus.",
    "You look at whether people think, in the abstraction, that the U.S. should divide into red and blue states.",
    "From what you see here at home, is all of this about the former president, or is something else driving it?",
    "ADAM SCHIFF: You have the executive branch represented by Joe Biden, and the legislative branch in a court.",
    "(Begin VT)\nTOM MANGER (U.S. Capitol Police Chief): The threat level is much higher than it was a year ago.",
    "Only 7 percent were unemployed at the time of their January 6th insurrection, nearly the national average.",
    "They're coming from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, Houston and Dallas.",
    "MARK STRASSMANN: Many doctors say avoid going to the E.R., often a COVID hotbed, especially for children.",
    "And you're, in fact, seeing more croup-like infections and bronchiolitis in New York City among children.",
    "Are you concerned about the country being at risk of political violence this week and in the years ahead?",
    "LIZ CHENEY: I'm very focused right now on my re-election and -- and on the work of the select committee.",
    "It's that democracy depends on not just folks following the norms, but thinking that other people will.",
    "When the American Rescue Plan passed, there was $10 billion for surveillance testing for our districts.",
    "(End VT)\nMARK STRASSMANN: Here in Georgia, testing now shows the positivity rate now pushes 40 percent.",
    "But most of America's major school systems will resume this week by teaching in person, while they can.",
    "Well, we know that this Omicron came quickly, and, in many districts, there aren't systems set up yet.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've raised in the past the possibility of criminal culpability for the president.",
    "What we're seeing is a movement that is a mainstream movement, not simply confined to fringe elements.",
    "I believe strongly in the policies of low taxes and limited government and a strong national defense.",
    "We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both.",
    "WOMAN: The numbers we're seeing, put that mask on, and keep it on through January at least, honestly.",
    "There is a very clear decoupling between cases at this point and hospitalizations and ICU admissions.",
    "And a cloth mask is not going to protect you from a virus that spreads through airborne transmission.",
    "But we're starting a third year of COVID, with new concerns and confusion about the Omicron variant.",
    "In terms of going back to school, I think the prerogative clearly is to try to get schools reopened.",
    "ADAM SCHIFF: We should begin them, I hope, in a matter of weeks, if not a couple of months from now.",
    "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand the $10 billion that was allocated in the American Rescue Plan.",
