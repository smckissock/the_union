    "In recent days, we've learned that Donald Trump fully intended to get the 2020 election overturned,? that he suggested law enforcement agencies could seize voting machines, and that, if elected in 2024, he might pardon those who violently attacked our seat of government, resulting in five dead and scores wounded.",
    "It declares that they want to destroy? Trump rather than help Republicans win the majority and that their committee is engaged in the persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.?\nThis is an extraordinary and revealing set of claims.",
    "The careful reader will note that there is no pressure of any kind on McCarthy toward further accountability for Trump; that is, there's no pressure on him flowing from the latest extraordinary revelations about Trump's true insurrectionist intent.",
    "As unlikely as that might seem, the fact that House Republicans are converging on an unabashed pro-insurrectionist stance can leave little doubt that a GOP-controlled House would be likely to execute this scheme if the conditions for it aligned.",
    "With new efforts to punish the two Republicans who most prominently think this conduct should be disqualifying to lead their party and should call forth a serious national reckoning and institutional response in defense of U.S. democracy.",
    "Indeed, the more we learn about that insurrectionist intent, the more the pressure on McCarthy runs in the other direction: to bury it, to whitewash it, to punish those who see it as disqualifying or even to firmly stand behind it.",
    "In an unsettling bit of reporting, Punchbowl News points out that this RNC move will put more pressure on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to hold a vote to expel Cheney and Kinzinger from the GOP conference.",
    "But he doesn't want to affirmatively expel those two apostates, Punchbowl reports, because it could take the focus off Democrats and place it on internecine fighting over Trump?:\nMcCarthy has a tightrope to walk here.",
    "The Republican Party's official, openly declared position is that its long-term prospects are inextricably bound up with securing total impunity for an effort to overthrow our political order at its very foundations.",
    "The official position being articulated here is that there's no need for any national political accounting with regard to the role that Trump and his co-conspirators played in inciting that violence.",
    "If he's seen as protecting Cheney and Kinzinger, the California Republican risks damaging his relationship with the hard right  a relationship that was once rocky but is now largely under control.",
    "Oozing with phony piety, they will insist that of course they condemn the violence and believe it deserves prosecution; they object only to the committee's onerous treatment of the nonviolent.",
    "One possibility, which would be addressed by reform of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, is that a GOP-controlled House might count sham presidential electors sent by a corrupt GOP governor.",
    "Not only that, the official party position is that those who sought to achieve this  including through mob intimidation and violence  are now to be seen as martyrs and heroes.",
    "The more Cheney and Kinzinger seek to hold Trump accountable for his effort to destroy our constitutional order, the more pressure McCarthy is under to expel them entirely.",
    "However, if he gives in to their demands, McCarthy puts the spotlight directly on his conference at a time when his best move is to keep a low profile.",
    "With the central GOP committee also converging on that stance, doesn't it seem plausible that much of the party would bless such a scheme as well?",
    "Right now, we're debating what to do about certain scenarios in which a GOP-controlled House helps overturn the 2024 presidential election.",
    "As The Post reports, the Wyoming GOP has privately arranged for the national party to financially back Cheney's primary challenger.",
    "and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) for their roles on the House select committee examining the Jan. 6 insurrection incited by Trump.",
    "The GOP's official party position has become that the orchestrators of insurrection are above accountability entirely.",
    "It should also shine a much harsher light on the threat to U.S. democracy posed by a potential GOP-controlled House.",
    "Cheney's effort to purge the party of its insurrectionist elements has itself become disqualifying in today's GOP.",
    "All that's working against this is the possibility that this might damage GOP efforts to retake the majority.",
    "McCarthy has largely tolerated the flourishing of insurrectionist sentiment in the House GOP.",
    "The censure resolution is explicit on why Cheney and Kinzinger are seen as such heretics.",
    "On Friday, the Republican National Committee voted to censure Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.)",
    "In essence, Republicans want to decouple the violence from the orchestrators of it.",
    "This is apparently a prerequisite for McCarthy to have a shot at becoming speaker.",
    "Republicans, of course, will protest that characterization.",
    "Cheney, meanwhile, is coming in for additional punishment.",
    "Trump has succeeded in making this party orthodoxy.",
    "This simply doesn't exist in McCarthy's calculus.",
    "As bad as all this is, there's still more.",
    "We don't have to accept this dodge.",
    "The cross-pressures run as follows."
