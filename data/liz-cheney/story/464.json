    "WASHINGTON  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Thursday endorsed Harriet Hageman, a primary challenger to GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the latest skirmish between Cheney and her party over her forceful criticism of former President Donald Trump.",
    "\"After spending time with Harriet, it is readily apparent she will always listen and prioritize the needs of her local communities and is focused on tackling our nation's biggest problems,\" McCarthy told The Federalist.",
    "Cheney's appointment last year by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be the vice chair of a House committee investigating Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol building only added fuel to the fire.",
    "McCarthy's move is all the more remarkable because until less than a year ago Cheney was a rising Republican star and GOP Conference chair - a leadership position she lost because of her anti-Trump stance.",
    "\"Cheney is doing nothing to help us, she is actively damaging the Republican party  both in Wyoming and nationally  and it's time for her to go,\" Hageman said in a statement about the endorsement.",
    "But Cheney's vocal rebuke of the former president and his false claims of a stolen election have been difficult to ignore for McCarthy and other GOP House leaders who have lined up behind Trump.",
    "Republican leadership also have said they view Cheney's criticism as a distraction as they prepare for midterm elections in November that are expected to return Republicans to power.",
    "\"I look forward to serving with Harriet for years to come.?\nJeremy Adler, a spokesman for Cheney's campaign, said of Hageman: \"Wow, she must be really desperate.\"",
    "Once a defender of Cheney, McCarthy's endorsement of Hageman is the clearest sign that he wants to send former vice president Dick Cheney's daughter packing.",
    "Party leadership does not typically endorse in primaries, particularly against an incumbent who previously held a high ranking role within the caucus.",
    "\"The most successful Representatives in Congress focus on the needs of their constituents,\" McCarthy said in a statement following his endorsement.",
    "In October, Cheney called out McCarthy for attempting to block? the House select committee investigating the assault on the Capitol.\"",
    "Cheney previously served as one of McCarthy's deputies in GOP leadership until May, when she was stripped of the position.",
    "She was one of 10 Republican members of Congress who voted to impeach Trump in January following the Jan. 6 insurrection.",
    "Hageman is a former Cheney supporter, who previously donated to her congressional campaign.",
    "Trump endorsed Hageman, an attorney, in September.",
    "The primary is scheduled for Aug. 16."
