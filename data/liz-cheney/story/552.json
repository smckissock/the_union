    "*My favorite moment ever in a political debate is when in the 2016 SOS debate the three candidates, Schwab, McClendon and the Libertarian were asked what kind of IT experience they have, and the libertarian says he knows, like, you know, a lot about computers, then McClendon was called on and said, well, I was, uhhh, CEO of Google Earth where we managed 1 billion secure user accounts globally across multiple platforms...?",
    "Watch as they grill Schwab on all the best Big Lie theories the best bit starts at 44:00 in when Rep. Lee begins her questions, clearly reading from something that has been fed to her and that she does not understand.",
    "It is one of those Am I rooting for Liz Cheney?? moments, as SOS Schwab, who again was a far far right legislator, actually appears to know what he is doing and is on the side of truth vs. the Big Lie proponents.",
    "Note Schwab took over the job from Kris Kobach, and barely beat in his initial election, by 3 pts, Dem Brian McClendon, former CEO of Google Earth who is from Lawrence*.",
    "Listening to Schwab dismiss conspiracy after conspiracy and get a little exasperated about it was well worth watching.",
    "Late word is that he now has a Republican primary challenger because he isn't parroting the Big Lie.",
    "As a legislator, he was on the far, far right, and was not on our side in just about anything.",
    "x\nx\nx\nThe Kansas House Elections Committee met, and had Schwab as their special guest.",
    "Scott Schwab (R) is the Kansas SOS.",
    "Here is some genuine entertainment.",
    "Get the popcorn."
