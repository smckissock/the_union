    "I will continue to focus my efforts on standing for truth and working to fight the political matrix that's led us to where we find ourselves today. Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) February 4, 2022\nCheney also tweeted about the issue but did not directly mention the resolution, saying, \"the leaders of the Republican Party have made themselves hostages to a man who admits he tried to overturn a presidential election and suggests he would pardon Jan. 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy.\"",
    "The resolution came under consideration at the RNC's winter meeting in Salt Lake City and urges the party to \"immediately cease any and all support of them as members of the Republican Party for their behavior which has been destructive to the institution of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Republican Party and our republic, and is inconsistent with the position of the conference.\"",

    "The move is the latest action by party leaders to punish key Republicans who are viewed as disloyal to former President Donald Trump.",
    "Kinzinger tweeted Thursday that he has \"no regrets about my decision to uphold my oath of office and defend the Constitution.\"",
    "That followed a move in May by House Republicans to remove Cheney from her position as House Conference chairwoman.",

    "The resolution passed the RNC's resolutions committee unanimously on Thursday ahead of the full vote.",
