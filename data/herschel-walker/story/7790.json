    "Walkers strategy so far has actually been less dark basement and more velvet rope  an invitation-only campaign with access granted mostly to friendly conservative media and a schedule full of curated church events, GOP meetings and Republican fundraisers that youre welcome to attend  if you can find them or fork over the cash to get in.",

    "Speaking of Perdue, the candidate has given near-total access to his campaign for Governor, unlike his tightly controlled Senate race, and hes a better candidate for it.",
    "But theyre almost impossible for the average voter to find without following the right GOP county parties on Facebook or getting an email from a friend in the know.",
    "The local television station spoke to Walker briefly after the event, but noted they had not been able to ask about Ukraine or other important issues of the day.",
    "Other reporters might ask about the police reports from women in his past who said they were afraid for their lives because of their interactions with him.",

    "Some of them wouldnt be easy, nor should they be for a person who wants to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate.",
    "He was introduced not as a Senate candidate, but one of the greatest athletes of all time, ever in any sport.",
    "Typically, the hosts are full of compliments, the questions are open-ended, and the follow-ups are limited.",
    "Its easy to see why Walkers campaign would rather not grant extensive media access to their candidate.",
    "Or whether he thinks the 2020 election was stolen as Donald Trump and David Perdue both alleged.",
