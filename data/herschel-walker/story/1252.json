    "Kemp's campaign Tuesday said Perdue's reluctance is proof he is failing to gain traction with conservatives across Georgia.?\nGeorgia Republicans need a proven winner who will make sure Stacey Abrams' road to the White House ends in Georgia - not a failed politician who was too scared to debate Jon Ossoff,? said Kemp spokesman Cody Hall.",
    "But he's made a string of gaffes even with conservative interviewers, including falsely labeling John Lewis as a senator who would have opposed a voting rights expansion named in his honor, and claiming it was totally unfair? to ask whether he supported a bipartisan infrastructure measure signed into law months ago.",
    "I'm going to debate Raphael Warnock, because I'm going to win this primary and I'm going to the general.?\nThat brought howls from some supporters who worried that Walker needed the experience to sharpen his oratory skills before going head-to-head with Warnock, a charismatic pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church.",
    "Perdue is proud to be the only Trump endorsed candidate in this race and welcomes the opportunity to highlight a bold conservative vision to fight for Georgia.?\nWalker, a former football great, faces a different scenario.",
    "Facing opponents in the single-digits in recent polls, Walker's campaign wants to shelter him from a potentially damaging encounter with Republican adversaries who have ratcheted up their attacks in recent weeks.",
    "While Stacey Abrams and U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock have avoided serious Democratic opposition, the intense GOP competition has created a divide among top candidates over whether to take part in debates.",
    "In an interview, Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black said the ex-football standout is taking cues from consultants who don't want him to rattle off more bizarre? remarks in an unforgiving spotlight.",
    "Far ahead of his Republican rivals in polls and fundraising, Walker has until recently attended mostly tightly controlled events with friendly audiences.",
    "Brian Kemp chastised David Perdue, his main primary challenger, for not yet committing to a series of showdowns ahead of their May 24 matchup.",
    "The issue is touchy for Perdue, who was criticized for refusing to debate Democrat Jon Ossoff last year in the sole Senate runoff showdown.",
    "I'm thinking about debating Raphael Warnock, because that's who I need to be debating right now,? Walker said after qualifying on Monday.",
    "Details are being worked out with debate hosts and the full schedule will be announced soon,? said campaign spokeswoman Jenni Sweat.",
    "The governor in February said he'd participate in four statewide televised debates, but Perdue has not accepted the challenge.",
    "Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker indicated he won't debate his GOP rivals.",
    "The Perdue campaign said it will participate in at least one debate.",
    "Walker's top rival took his criticism a step further.",
    "That's why he won't return your phone call.",
    "I'm just simply asking: What is he dodging?",
    "That's why he's not coming to debates.",
    "Because celebrity status won't win.?",
    "I'm not running on celebrity.",
    "Are you afraid of me?",
    "Please,? Black said.",
    "Gov."
