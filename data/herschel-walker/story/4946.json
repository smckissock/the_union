    "Vote for David Perdue, a really wonderful man who will be a great Governor!? Trump added:\nStatement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America\n RSBN gg (@RSBNetwork) April 26, 2022\nPerdue, the Trump-endorsed candidate in the Peach States GOP governors race, sparred with Kemp Sunday night, opening up the debate by making it clear the 2020 election was rigged and stolen? and accusing Kemp of caving and allowing it to happen by refusing to stand up to Democrats.",
    "As Breitbart News detailed:\nAll that started right here in Georgia when our governor caved and allowed radical Democrats to steal our election, and because of that, he has divided our party and cannot win,? Perdue continued, attempting to distinguish himself as a champion of election integrity, in contrast to Kemp, whom he blames for the current state of affairs in many respects, as Kemp ultimately certified the election despite former President Trumps calls for action.",
    "In a Monday statement, Trump said the debate was a BIG win for David Perdue, who exposed Brian Kemp as the RINO that we all know him to be.?\nTrump identified Perdue as the only Republican who can defeat Stacey The Hoax Abrams,? and said:\nIt also showed how important it is for the MAGA voters to go and support David Perdue in the Election.",
    "However, Perdue placed the blame back on Kemp, contending that the governor caved in and gave the elections to Stacey and to the liberal Democrats in 2020.?\nA recent survey from the University of Georgias School of Public and International Affairs shows Kemp with a sizable lead over Perdue, 53 percent to the former senators 26 percent.",
    "Ive always said theres fraud in every election, and when I was secretary of state, I went after it,? Kemp said, clarifying that he didnt say there wasnt problems in this election.?\nLook, I was as frustrated as anybody else,? Kemp said, contending that a special session would not have resolved the issue.",
    "He also predicted that a Kemp win would negatively affect the great Herschel Walkers race for the Senate  it will be very hard for him to win with Kemp on the ticket.?\nDont let the Democrats, or the RINOs win in Georgia.",
    "A lot is on the line, including record-setting CRIME, which Brian Kemp has done nothing about, letting great communities like Buckhead be overrun by theft, murders, shootings, and drug deals.",
    "Brian Kemp (R), for his debate performance Sunday, where he challenged the governor for failing to stand up to the Democrats election schemes in 2020.",
    "Former President Donald Trump heaped praise on Georgia gubernatorial candidate former Sen. David Perdue (R), who is running against incumbent Gov.",
    "The two continued to exchange jabs, as Kemp knocked Perdue for losing his Senate seat to Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) in the runoff election.",
    "It is not easy to beat an incumbent, however, if our voters turn out, David Perdue will win in a landslide.",
    "Perdue asserted that Kemp did not use his position of power to fight back hard enough.",
    "MAGA voters, Trump continued, will not come out to support Kemp."
