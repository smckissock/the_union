    "This is not a coincidence but is a direct result of Democrat policies which have shipped American jobs, manufacturing, and energy overseas, making us reliant on everyone else and causing inflation to skyrocket, Mallory Blount said, without addressing insulin prices specifically.",
    "Anticipating the criticism of inflation, which has spiked up in recent months, Warnock said the increase in demand for goods coming out of the pandemic, along with alleged price gouging by shippers and others along the supply chain, were a major factor in price increases.",
    "Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, and Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, found that drug makers who sell insulin used anticompetitive practices to increase revenue and capture market share while doubling or tripling the price of insulin in the process.",
    "By then Republicans had developed a strategy to convince voters that Warnock  at the time an untested first-time candidate  was a radical, liberal Marxist sympathizer, someone so fundamentally different from most Georgians that voters could never trust him.",
    "Thats hard to say, but a look at his latest bill to limit out-of-pocket expenses for patients on insulin is a good example of Warnock taking the lead on a significant pocketbook issue that fails to live up to the radical election-year hype.",
    "Instead of the Federal Government creating price controls, lets create competition within the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries and lower the cost of medication through free-market principles, King suggested.",
    "Instead, Warnock has become a reliable vote for Senate Democrats, a meticulously tailored, high-profile progressive at the mainstream of his party who still looks for bipartisan measures to join when he can.",
    "Loeffler executed on that strategy so relentlessly during the debate that she called him radical, liberal Raphael Warnock more than a dozen times and ended up as a spoof on Late Night with Seth Myers.",
    "The American Diabetes Association estimates that more than 1 million Georgians live with diabetes, which has a significantly higher rate in minority communities and among people over 65.",
    "Radical Liberal Raphael Warnock, the villain from the campaign, might have seized drug companies insulin supplies or drawn up a new federal program to make insulin free for all.",
    "It requires a multi-tiered approach, but what Im focused on right now is lowering the costs for ordinary people as we continue to push our way back from the pandemic, he said.",
    "The moment that the 2021 Senate runoff campaign really jumped the shark came during the only debate between then-U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler and now-U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock.",
    "Warnock said the cost of buying insulin, which has more than doubled in recent years, is a challenge he sees his parishioners facing and hears about from constituents.",
    "Recently, the Ebenezer pastor has also introduced or joined a series of bills to address pocketbook issues, like the price of gas, medicine, and other necessities.",
    "Kelvin King, one of the four Republicans running to challenge Warnock, said two of his wifes grandparents died from the disease, so its a personal issue for him.",
    "Whether Warnocks and the Democrats approach to the economy and health care is effective will be a legitimate matter of debate for voters in the 2022 elections.",
    "But he said a proposal like Warnocks that lets the federal government set the price of insulin would just shift the costs to other areas of healthcare.",
    "But the senator voters were warned he would morph into  literally a screaming, anti-Semitic, Castro-loving, crazed communist, has never materialized.",
    "Is that because its good election-year politics in a battleground state or because theres a more pragmatic streak than Warnock was given credit for?",
    "A spokeswoman for Herschel Walker blamed Warnock and President Joe Biden for inflationary pressures driving up the prices across the economy.",
    "We help patients to better manage their healthcare and I think we address some of the costs in our larger healthcare ecosystem, Warnock said.",
    "Since the cost wouldnt just go away, the remaining expense under Warnocks measure would be covered by the drug companies selling insulin.",
    "Several states, including not-radically-liberal Utah, Kentucky, and West Virginia, already cap the cost of the drug for some patients.",
    "But simply painting Raphael Warnock as a radical cartoon villain is a debate tactic thats already been tried and failed.",
    "The ADA also estimates that one out of every four health care dollars goes to treating diabetes or its related effects.",
    "I can tell you as a pastor, Ive seen up close what happens when this disease is not managed properly, Warnock said.",
    "Getting into the weeds of policy is not something that happens in most campaigns, but it does happen occasionally.",
    "Leaving people to skip doses because of costs can lead to a spiral of dangerous, and expensive, side effects.",
    "Importantly, the bill is targeted at just those already covered by Medicare or through private insurance.",
    "The Warnock Senate mailroom has had hundreds of letters and emails from Georgians looking for help.",
    "The bill, S. 3700, would cap the price of insulin for diabetes patients at $35 per month.",
    "And we have the tools to make sure that people have access to lifesaving care.",
    "Ive seen the emergence of kidney disease and people forced to go on dialysis.",
    "This is not a partisan issue, Warnock told me in an interview.",
