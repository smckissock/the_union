    "The revelation of the most senior justice's spouse communicating with former President Donald Trump's administration personnel prompted some Democratic lawmakers to call on Thomas to recuse himself from cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, cases surrounding future 2024 elections, and even calls for him to step down or be impeached.",
    "On Wednesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse led a group of Democratic lawmakers in announcing a bill that would force the Supreme Court to adopt ethics standards, such as recusal requirements for justices with financial and personal connections to parties involved in cases before the court.",

    "Unlike lower-court federal judges, Supreme Court justices are not bound by the same code of conduct and are allowed to decide whether recusal is the appropriate choice in cases that might raise ethical concerns.",
    "But any consequences for Thomas are unlikely, as Republicans have defended his decision not to recuse himself and cited a justice's autonomy to make recusal decisions for themselves.",
    "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas met with Senate candidate Herschel Walker in his first quasi-public appearance since he was discharged from the hospital last month.",
    "Thomas, 73, was treated with intravenous antibiotics after he began experiencing \"flu-like symptoms\" last month and was discharged from the hospital on March 25.",
    "The only Supreme Court justice to have been impeached was Justice Samuel Chase in 1805 for conduct on the bench that was deemed overly partisan.",
    "The seat is key to Republican efforts to win the Senate majority in 2022, which would require a net of only one seat in the 50-50 chamber.",
    "He was not physically present for two weeks of high court oral arguments but took part remotely during his second week of absence.",
    "Walker, a University of Georgia football star in the early 1980s, is the likely Republican nominee to challenge Warnock.",
    "Justice Thomas is a strict Constitutionalist who has dedicated his life to law and order,\" Walker tweeted Friday.",

    "He was acquitted by the Senate."
