    "Ex-president plans rally after endorsing candidates seeking to replace leaders who rejected his election lie\nDonald Trumps continuing effort to bend national Republican candidates to his will and the party to do his bidding faces a test in the key state of Georgia on Saturday as the former president holds a score-settling rally there in support of candidates who could boost any future re-election agenda.",
    "Saturdays rally in Commerce, 70 miles north-east of Atlanta and one of the most conservative parts of the state, is expected to feature Herschel Walker, a former football player running for the US Senate; Perdue; and the congressional candidate Vernon Jones, a former Democratic state representative who began calling himself the Black Donald Trump after switching parties.",
    "Walker is slightly ahead of the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock in RealClearPolitics polling averages, but Jones, who dropped a bid for the governorship in February, faces a crowded Republican field for the conservative 10th congressional district, which covers part of east Georgia.",
    "Trumps presence in the state comes 18 months after he pressured Georgias secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find enough votes to overturn Joe Bidens victory, a conversation that is now the subject of a grand jury investigation in Atlanta.",
    "The loss, which made Trump the first Republican presidential candidate to lose the state in 28 years, continues to rankle the former president, and he has endorsed the state congressman Jody Hice in his challenge to Raffensperger.",
    "Perdue has toed Trumps false line of a stolen 2020 election and begun claiming that his defeat to the Democratic senator Jon Ossoff, to whom he conceded in January, was also problematic.",
    "It follows a similar pattern in other states where Trump has held or plans to hold rallies as a way of showing support for Republican candidates who have offered him their fealty.",
    "He also backed other candidates in the state against establishment Republicans, including David Perdue against the sitting governor, Brian Kemp.",
    "He will not be a help to Trump-endorsed candidates when he comes on Saturday, the conservative commentator Martha Zoller told the this week.",
    "Most people in Georgia know that something untoward happened in November 2020, he the talk radio host Bryan Pritchard.",
    "But Trump is playing a high-stakes game and his candidates success in Georgias May primaries is far from guaranteed.",
    "He will be negative and backward looking  and thats not what voters want.",
    "In my election and the presidents election, they were stolen.",
    "The evidence is compelling now.",
    "Ill just say it, Bryan."
