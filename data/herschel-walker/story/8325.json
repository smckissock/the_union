    "INDIANAPOLIS  As the Georgia Bulldogs prepare to take college footballs grandest stage once again, there are two overarching themes following them into Lucas Oil Stadium: Can they finally beat Alabama and will they finally hoist the national championship trophy for the first time in 41 years?",
    "And its a tremendous challenge for us, and really kind of an honor to have the opportunity to play against what we feel is one of the most elite programs in the country, and probably will be for some time in the future as well.",
    "What I feel is, how do we stop Bryce Young and how do we control their front and how do we run the ball, how do we throw the ball with efficiency, how do we convert third downs and stop them in the red area, Smart said.",
    "The Crimson Tide also will be without starting cornerback Josh Jobe (toe) and have injury concerns about cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis (hip) and offensive line starters Emil Ekiyor (shoulder) and Chris Owens (ankle).",
    "But during his tenure he has lifted Georgia to place it hasnt been since Vince Dooley landed Herschel Walker in the spring of 1980 and won a national championship and three SEC championships in a row.",
    "1 Alabama at Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, 8 p.m. Jan. 10\nTV / radio: ESPN, 750 AM, 95.5 FM, 1380 AM\nSubscribers will find more coverage, including souvenir pages, in print and ePaper editions.",
    "I think the University of Georgia, Kirbys program, is probably one of the elite programs in the country, he said next to Smart at the head coaches news conference Sunday at the JW Marriott.",
    "And receiver George Pickens (knee), safety Christopher Smith (knee) and Salyer (foot) are all significantly recorded from injuries that slowed them in the previous game against Alabama.",
    "Like in 2017 championship game when he switched to freshman quarterback Tua Tagovailoa at halftime and saw Tagovailoa lead them to a 26-23 come-from-behind victory over the Bulldogs.",
    "Everyone seems to agree that these two teams, which will meet in the College Football Playoff championship Monday night (8 p.m., ESPN), are indeed the two best in the land this year.",
    "This 2021 Georgia team was Smarts fifth straight team to finish in the top 10 of the CFP rankings, earn a New Years Six bowl berth and fourth to appear in the SEC Championship game.",
    "As much as that indicates a mismatch of Georgias secondary against Bamas receivers, it was more a function of the Bulldogs famed defensive front not being able to bring down Young.",
    "We have to attack it a little bit differently, said Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning, who has been good enough at his job to land the head coaching position at Oregon.",
    "Smart has done that, admittedly, by adopting the organizational template he learned from Saban at Alabama and applying it to the considerable potential that UGA always has had.",
    "And we certainly feel like this is the best team in the country that we have an opportunity to play, the most consistent team all season long, in terms of how they played.",
    "Bamas sophomore quarterback from California passed for 421 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another in the Tides shockingly one-sided 41-24 victory.",
    "Thats based, in part, on Georgias dominating 34-11 rebound win over Michigan in the Orange Bowl semifinal and the relative health of the respective teams.",
    "As far as the way we organize and run the program, most of that came from my time spent with Coach Saban, Smart said Sunday of his Alabama influence.",
    "That Alabama coach Nick Saban was Kirby Smarts boss for 10 years and remains so even after Smart left his employ adds to the Bulldogs angst.",
    "1 team for eight consecutive weeks, logged their first undefeated regular season since 1982 and Smart was named the SEC coach of the year.",
    "That includes the SEC Championship game a month ago in Atlanta and the national championship game in the same place now four years past.",
    "The latest, an $80 million football operations addition to the Butts-Mehre Complex, wont be 100 percent complete until later this month.",
    "What I control is who we recruit, how we develop players, how we keep people in our program, and then how we do scheme-wise.",
    "Tight end Brock Bowers, who had 10 catches and a touchdown in the last meeting, has a sore shoulder but is expected to play.",
    "Alabama will be without its receptions leader, John Metchie, who went down with a knee injury during the last Georgia game.",
    "It is them, the loyal season-ticket holders and donors, who have paid the freight for what Smart has done with the program.",
    "Those are the two words that have punctuated every sentence about Georgias accomplishments during Smarts six-year reign.",
    "But not to those who have been invested in the Bulldogs pursuits since they last lifted a national championship trophy.",
    "The Bulldogs rolled into the conference championship game as 6.5-point favorites over Alabama and promptly lost by 17.",
    "Since Smart arrived in December of 2015, that group has stepped up to fund more than $175 million of new facilities.",
    "When he have our reunions once or twice a year, Tim Morrison never forgets to remind everyone, it is still about us.",
    "So, the time would appear right for Georgia to vanquish the beasts of both Bama and a 41-year championship drought.",
    "I am 63 now, said Scott Woerner, whose interception clinched Georgias 17-10 win over Notre Dame on Jan. 1, 1981.",
    "Offensive tackle Jamaree Salyer indicated the players actually have embraced their history versus Alabama.",
    "If the Bulldogs do, Smart said it wont be because he feels the mounting external pressure to get it done.",
    "Yet, with all that history, the Bulldogs remained 2.5-point favorites on the eve of the title game.",
    "This will be the 10th time Saban has led his team onto the field for a national championship game.",
    "Wide receiver Jameson Williams hauled in two of Youngs passes for touchdowns of 67 and 55 yards.",
    "Or the 2018 SEC Championship game, when he switched back to Jalen Hurts and beat Georgia again.",
    "But were not trying to make it an emotional thing, where you go out playing with emotions.",
    "With the same players competing 37 days later, is it possible that turns out differently?",
    "Thats not to mention across-the-board increases in staff, payroll and recruiting budget.",
    "But that anxiety lay only with the Bulldogs fan base, not with the players and coaches.",
    "Not coincidentally, Young picked up the Heisman Trophy in New York the next week.",
    "Flattering, yes, but hollow words to the ears of so many in UGAs fan base.",
    "(The drought) is the furthest from my concern because I dont control that.",
    "You take a lot of things from the places you come from in your history.",
    "It was Alabama that made all the meaningful plays in the last meeting.",
    "They always seem to have answers, especially when the stakes get high.",
    "You want to be calm, collected, composed, attack and play our game.",
    "To say they didnt pressure the quarterback would be inaccurate.",
    "They had good answers and played better than we did that day.",
    "Hes done that by having the right answers at the right time.",
    "Hes done an outstanding job making that program what it is.",
    "If you do that right, the other will take care of itself.",
    "But Georgia has lost seven in a row to the Crimson Tide.",
    "There was (also) a year at LSU, a year at Dolphins.",
    "With Georgia, everything still seems fresh and new.",
    "There are a lot of different ways we can do that.",
    "Georgia registered 15 QB hurries in the contest.",
    "The Bulldogs, who were the nations consensus No.",
    "That is not something about which Saban gloats.",
    "Thats the thing about facing Saban and Alabama.",
    "Its the truth, said the senior from Atlanta.",
    "Thats certainly helped shape me as a coach.",
    "Who would have thought 41 years would pass?",
    "Georgia-Alabama championship coverage\nNo.",
    "Smart is himself is 0-4 against Alabama.",
    "You cant really run away from the truth.",
    "The Bulldogs are relatively healthy.",
    "Somebodys just got to make a play.",
    "Bryce Young was chief playmaker.",
    "That will be the key to Monday.",
    "It finished with zero sacks.",
