    "Fox News also drove a lot of the disinformation in coverage of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Moulitsas said he was surprised by how quickly the narrative seemed to shape-shift to whatever was most convenient and absolved the GOP and Trump of any responsibility: I saw the conversation [on Fox News] go from these are heroes of democracy, to they were hoodlums, to they were antifa and it was all a false flag, to now theyre heroes again.",
    "Theyre going to be voting on real personalities, and some of the personalities the Republicans are already putting upespecially in the Senate races, but were about to see more of what theyre putting up in these swing districtsthese people are a little off their rocker in the way that they were in 2010 and 2012, when the Republicans were sort of scheduled to take back the Senate and missed that opportunity twice in a row.",
    "Moving to push some popular policiessuch as the insulin cap and the child tax credit in single-issue billsonto the Senate floor, where Republicans will filibuster them, will make it clear that Republicans are obstructing progress and take the focus off of discord within the Democratic Party, particularly as it relates to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.",
    "They also spoke with guest Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America, who joined the show to discuss Republicans messaging strategy heading into the midterms, the danger presented by Fox News, and how people can take real, meaningful action to disarm the misinformation-spreading media conglomerate.",
    "Media Matters is a nonprofit organization and media watchdog group that keeps a close eye on false information spreading in the mediaparticularly right-wing media outletsand Carusone offered a deeper dive into what we can expect this fall from Republicans in light of what is being discussed on Fox News.",
    "But they almost never get into the specifics of the personalities of someone like Herschel Walker or of Donald Trump making all these endorsements of people like Sean Purnell, who had to drop out of that Pennsylvania Senate race because he was an alleged wife beater and lost custody of his children.",

    "... You can point to all of their major narratives that they push and it will be nearly identical on what they call their news programming and their opinion programming  Theyve been increasingly getting rid of their news programs and replacing them with opinion hosts.",
    "And once they started to inject the ideas that it was a false flag operation, that it was a setup, that it was being purely done to attack Donald Trump, it wasnt that bad, it was overdramatizedit started to chip away at the consensus that had emerged.",
    "They are the second-most expensive channel on everybodys cable box  If these cable companies just drop Fox Business or hold the line  thats the simple answer: people can call  cut the cord, and make sure they know youre doing it because of Fox News.",
    "Carusone talked about the false idea that Fox News and Fox Opinion are separate from one another: One of the ways they convince people that theyre an actual news organization instead of, say, a partisan operation, is Look at our news site.",
    "They have to actually undermine thatthey cant operate in the meaningful space of truth; they have to create this alternate bubble with alternate facts in order to be able to continue to make the kinds of arguments that theyre making.",
    "There was a study done a while ago, I think it was by Pew [Research Center], if you were a regular Fox viewer, you were fundamentally less informed than if you received no information at alland that it actually was a net negative.",
    "Caruso highlighted Fox News vulnerability in its reliance on subscriptions from cable subscribers, calling on viewers to take simple action to disarm the disinformation-spreading media conglomerate:\nThey dont need ad revenue.",
    "This cycle is going to be culture war stuff  It creates a schism and an internal food fight amongst the left, because it forces us to seemingly make a choice between winning elections and the values that we say we have.",
    "As Moulitsas and Eleveld welcomed Carusone onto the show, the conversation about political narratives continued, but with a specific focus on how the media plays into driving these narratives, especially false ones.",
    "Do you think that Fox helped open up the gate to that narrative so that Republicans in Congress picked up on it, or were Republicans in Congress already saying that, and then Fox sort of picked up on that narrative?",
    "In 2014, the biggest conversation narrative on Fox News was that Barack Obama was not doing enough to stop ebola  it was the major theme, and it was, in effect: Obama is so bad about viruses, can you believe this?",
    "Caruso added that Foxs influence on people happens both directly and indirectly:\nIf youre a regular Fox viewer and that is helping shape your worldview, your perception is going to be distinct from the reality.",
    "On this weeks episode of The Brief, hosts Markos Moulitsas and Kerry Eleveld chatted about what to expect in the midterm elections later this year and whats missing from mainstream coverage of this cycle.",
    "Carusone thinks Republicans run a very similar playbook each midterm cycle, though it changes slightly depending on what issue they can make the new political boogeyman issue:\nIn 2014, it was ebola.",
    "I would just add that a lot of these mainstream overviewsa lot of them start with these historical references about how bad midterm elections are for the party thats in power, et cetera.",
    "We do the analysis of Fox coverage hyping something, and then you can see the rest of the news media follows a week or so later because they can create a threat that becomes an issue ...",
    "Based off of what narratives have been circulating on Fox News, Moulitsas asked Carusone: Do you have a sense yet what that the Republican message is going to be in the 2022 cycle?",
    "In fact, she argued that it is time for the White House to make Republicans actively vote against Democrats legislation through which they are attempting to make actual progress.",
    "You can watch the full episode below:\nx\nx\nx\nListen to The Brief on the following platforms:\nApple Podcast\nSpotify\nStitcher\nGoogle Podcast\nThis is a short blurb about Daily Kos.",
    "And they turned it into another political issue, almost like they did with COVID  you do that enough  and you change the consensus on [what should be nonpolitical issues].",
    "Moulitsas pointed out how all of the effects of false narratives shake out: Its a net negative for society in general  [but] its a positive for the conservative movement.",
    "She added: This framing that Democrats are failing as opposed to Republicans oppose these measures that are, again, broadly, broadly popular [is so frustrating].",
    "And they created, just by who they booked during that time period, the overemphasis on electeds that were pushing those conspiracies and those claims.",
    "Caruso answered that, while Fox News wasnt the only network driving some of these false narratives:\nThey still have an enormous agenda-setting power.",
    "Closing out, Markos asked Carusone what people could do to take direct action against Fox News: What can people do to stop funding Fox News directly?",
    "Moulitsas made note of the current narrative that Republicans are spreading, which falsely ties the LGBTQ+ community to pedophilia and grooming.",
    "And thats really the destructive power here, is that you take this one thing where in a brief moment, largely we all agree that its not okay.",

    "Im saying that if all the cards come out correctly, we actually have a real chance to pick up seats.",
    "It seemed like they just threw every possible narrative, none of them internally consistent.",
    "And then you talk about the Supreme Court getting rid of Roe v. Wade in the summer sometime.",
    "There are so many wild cards  Remember, in 2016, all the polls had Donald Trump losing.",
    "Eleveld added that these were crazy, crazy rationalizations for what was going on.",
    "That's not just journalists, but fact-checkers, editors, and administrative staff.",
    "And thats going to be their big push  around culture war themes, Carusone agreed.",
    "It changes the narrative, because it creates a different permission structure.",
    "This is a purely juice the base strategyits not mainstream, Eleveld added.",
    "We don't have corporate backers that are only in it for the bottom line.",
