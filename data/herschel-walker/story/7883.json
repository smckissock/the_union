    "Flroida attorney Ron Filipkowski tweeted out what appeared to be a copy of the letter sent by a member of the Biden Administration to Oz on March 23;\nAlthough it hasnt been verified whether this was a copy of the actual letter that Oz received, the second to last line did say Should we not receive your resignation, your position with the Council will be terminated effective 6:00 pm tonight.",
    "His next tweet on the thread indicated that If President Biden want to politicize health, he will have to fire me:\nAs you can see in the tweet above and in the following tweet, some on the Twittersphere responded to Ozs claim of politicizing health with an open the Hatch response:\nThe Hatch Act is a federal law that was passed in 1939.",
    "If at 5:39 pm on March 23, you were wondering when Oz might mention Fauci again then wait for it, wait for it, you only had to wait less than three hours for it:\nBingo, Oz shifted the topic back to Fauci again, insisting that The doctor [Biden] should ask to resign is Dr. Fauci, for a multitude of obvious reasons.",
    "That apparently prompted the Biden Administration to ask Oz and Walker on March 23 to resign:\nAs you can see, Oz mentioned Covid in his tweet even though he was sked to resign from the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition and not the President's Council on Covid, Covid, and Covid.",

    "He didnt mention Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in these tweets, even though some of his previous tweets have been rather Fauci-centric, as I covered for Forbes on February 28.",
    "Both Oz, who previously had hosted The Dr. Oz Show, and Walker, who was a star running back in college and the NFL, had become Council members during the Trump Administration, being appointed by then-U.S. President Donald Trump.",
    "Oz subsequently responded on March 26 to these Hatch references with another tweet:\nThis time he claimed in his attached letter that the Hatch Act didnt apply to him because he was a Less restricted Special Government Employee.",
    "According to Donald Judd and Maegan Vazquez reporting for CNN, a White House official indicated that the Biden administration has a policy that doesnt allow those running for federal office to serve on Presidential boards.",
    "It tries to to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation.",
    "Will Oz do what Costanza did in that episode of the TV show Seinfeld, when Costanza continued to show up at Rick Barr Properties, even though he no longer worked there?",
    "The only example that Oz offered was that Fauci was disparaging President Trump and praising candidate Biden just four days before the 2020 Presidential election.",

    "Anthony Fauci, MD, doesnt serve on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.",
    "Well, the list of members on the Councils website no longer includes either Oz or Walker.",
    "He also asserted that I will consider myself a Council member unless otherwise noted.",
    "Thus the Council will have two new members, presumably to replace Oz and Walker.",
    "So, will this be a George Costanza-like situation?",
    "Happy Valentine's Day to everyone except Fauci!"
