    "Donald Trump staked a huge amount of his personal prestige and influence on toppling Kemp purely out of spite over Trumps loss of Georgia in 2020, and while the jury is still out in some of the other Georgia Republican primaries, common sense and Kemps conservative record have triumphed tonight over the most debased forms of Trump sycophancy.",
    "Its early yet in the vote-counting in todays primaries in Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas, but this much is clear: Brian Kemp has steamrolled David Perdue, who just conceded the race.",
    "Early vote tallies have Kemp up by even larger margins than Herschel Walker, who has already been called the winner of Georgias Senate primary against little-known opponents.",
    "But he chose this path, and he richly deserved this ending.",
    "He didnt have to end his career this way.",
    "David Perdue was a good senator."
