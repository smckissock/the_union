    "The fact that this years GOP Senate primary features Herschel Walker, arguably the greatest college football player of all time who won a national championship with the University of Georgia, probably helps stir public interest in the race, as well as President Trumps furious denunciations of incumbent GOP governor Brian Kemp, although Kemp is leading the polls by a wide margin.",

    "It is worth noting that Georgia did not have a U.S. Senate election in 2018, although it did have a fairly competitive GOP gubernatorial primary, and Stacey Abrams generated her own attention as she won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.",
    "Georgia does not register voters by party, but the Georgia Secretary of States office knows which party primary these voters are casting ballots in, and the numbers so far show minority voters are growing more interested in the GOP primary.",
    "It is possible that this early vote turnout is just taking a bite out of the election day vote, and that turnout in this years Georgia primaries wont be anything special.",
    "This is not the result that one would expect if the legislation was aimed at voter suppression, and makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle,? as President Biden put it.",
    "Legislation that Democrats insisted was a sinister plot to keep Georgians away from the polls has, so far, yielded a lot more Georgians coming out to vote.",
