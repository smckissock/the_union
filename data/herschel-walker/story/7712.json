    "Fifth, when major news breaks about the attempt coup  such as revelations that a senator lied about the extent of his involvement in the effort to overturn the election and badger state legislatures into overriding the will of their voters  the media should demand comment, both from the person implicated and from GOP leadership.",
    "First, they should provide regular updates on efforts to suppress voting, ballot and election chaos created by new laws and candidates running for key state-level offices (e.g., secretary of state, attorney general, governor) who still support the big lie that the election was stolen.",
    "Third, when Republicans are mentioned in print or introduced on air, their position on challenging electoral votes, the big lie, the attempted coup, voting rights legislation and the Jan. 6 commission should be noted.",
    "Not one of the five major Sunday talk shows mentioned the revelation that Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) had supported efforts to overturn the 2020 election despite no evidence of fraud, as my colleague James Downie reported.",
    "Finally, Republicans who refuse to show up for debates, such as Senate candidates Herschel Walker in Georgia and Rep. Ted Budd in North Carolina, should be asked at every opportunity why they are hiding.",
    "Second, the media should ramp up coverage of civil and criminal prosecutions stemming from the attempted coup, including the investigation underway by the district attorney in Fulton County, Ga.",
    "So long as Republicans can easily evade questions about their ongoing support of the big lie and its primary proponent, the media effectively enable the GOPs assault on democracy.",
    "As a result, the media treats the GOP as if it were a normal party, covering its insane conspiracy theories and lies about the 2020 election as if they were horse-race stories.",
    "The GOP is not consistently identified as the party seeking to impair voting or thwart the House select committees investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection.",
    "Nor are they asked about a spate of laws that Republicans are pursuing at the state level to make voting harder or politicize election administration.",
    "The national media should cover efforts such as those in Wisconsin to decertify the 2020 election (yes, Trump supporters are still stuck on that!).",
    "The media should explain the possibility that a GOP House majority might not allow an elected Democratic president to take office in January 2025.",
    "Do they think they are entitled to block a Democratic presidents qualified nomination to the Supreme Court if a vacancy emerges?",
    "Republicans who appear for TV interviews are rarely  if ever  asked basic questions about the ongoing threat to our democracy.",
    "Would they support the defeated former president if he ran again, even though he instigated a violent assault on the Capitol?",
    "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) should be asked about this at every news conference and in every interview.",
    "Days can go by without national newspapers or cable TV programming mentioning the coup attempt or voting suppression.",
    "Media outlets should cover the debates anyway, even if they feature only a single candidate and an empty podium.",
    "Multiple news outlets have dedicated themselves to covering democracy, yet coverage has not changed much.",
    "Fourth, Republicans need to be pressed about their plans if they take majorities in the House or Senate.",
    "Or why they oppose reauthorization of the preclearance provisions in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.",
    "This is relevant information to determining whether these people have credibility and are pro-democracy.",
    "And they should continue to cover the negotiations underway to reform the Electoral Count Act.",
    "The media should also track disbarment claims filed against lawyers who pursued bogus claims.",
    "There are plenty of other ways to keep the public informed about threats to our democracy.",
    "Why should voters trust them not to shut down the government and default on the debt?",
    "Unfortunately, democracy often remains an afterthought in political coverage.",
    "How can people who tried to disenfranchise voters be trusted with power?",
    "For example, do they believe President Biden was legitimately elected?",
    "Do they regret supporting Donald Trump during his impeachment trials?",
    "Would they seek to short-circuit the Jan. 6 investigation?",
    "(Look, he got former president Donald Trumps endorsement!",
    "Look how cleverly she sticks with the MAGA line!)",
    "Its a small example of a larger problem.",
    "It should be more than a one-day story.",
    "Will they try to impeach Biden?",
    "Not relevant!",
    "Old news!",
    "Really?"
