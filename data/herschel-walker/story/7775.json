    "In doing so, Walker has established a parallel record of demonstrably false claims, many of which appear to bear no resemblance to reality whatsoever.\"",
    "They can hardly blame Republican voters who have imbibed their low standards for being open to candidates who might lose in general elections.",
    "Or is there something more fundamental about the party that attracts liars, hucksters, accused abusers and shameless con men?",
    "Theyve long given up the notion that ethical conduct, honesty, empathy or self-discipline have anything to do with politics.",
