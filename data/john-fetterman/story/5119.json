    "Democrats watching the primary believe Mr. Fetterman’s cash advantage is a huge obstacle for Mr. Lamb and for state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, in that they need to both increase their own support and drag down Mr. Fetterman, an expensive proposition in a state where campaigns rely heavily on TV advertising.",
    "The lieutenant governor has more than three times as much money as U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb for the final month of the primary, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer analysis of campaign disclosures filed Friday — a key factor, since polls already show Mr. Fetterman far ahead.",
    "PHILADELPHIA — A turbulent few weeks and hard-hitting attacks have done little to change one of the persistent realities of Pennsylvania’s Democratic primary for U.S. Senate: John Fetterman has a crucial money lead.",
    "That’s because $970,000 of Mr. Lamb’s fund is designated for the general election, reflecting his reliance on big donors whose contributions often exceed the $2,900 limit that can be used in the primary.",
    "Among the 51 donors to the PAC were Constance Hess Williams, a former state senator from Montgomery County; Joshua Bekenstein, CEO of Bain Capital; and Thomas B. Hagen, who heads Erie Insurance.",
    "Penn Progress Inc., a super PAC supporting Mr. Lamb, helped narrow the spending gap against Mr. Fetterman by chipping in $1.1 million on Mr. Lamb’s behalf and had $833,000 left in the bank.",
    "Even considering the super PAC backing Mr. Lamb, Mr. Fetterman has more than twice as much to spend as Mr. Lamb and his allies — despite already outspending them both.",
    "But looking only at money available for the primary, Mr. Fetterman has $3.9 million to about $1.2 million for Mr. Lamb, according to the Inquirer analysis.",
    "As usual, Mr. Fetterman has relied on small donors, with more than half of his receipts in this report coming from people who gave less than $200.",
    "About 40% of that came from Pennsylvania donors, with most of the remainder coming from Massachusetts, California, Connecticut and New York.",
    "That’s because a significant chunk of Mr. Lamb’s campaign funds can only be used in November’s general election, not the May primary.",
    "Mr. Fetterman raised $3.1 million in the first three months of 2022 and spent $4.3 million as the campaign took on new intensity.",
    "The financial edge is even larger than it first looks on paper, despite Mr. Lamb reporting his best fundraising quarter so far.",
    "Mr. Lamb raised $1.74 million in the same time frame, his best quarter yet, and spent about $2.5 million.",
    "Mr. Fetterman had $4.2 million in the bank as of March 31, compared with Mr. Lamb’s $2.2 million.",
    "Mr. Kenyatta continued to struggle raising money, despite polling better than many predicted.",
    "He raised $306,000 and had $271,000 left for the primary’s final weeks.",
    "More than 80% of his funds came from donors who gave more than $200.",
    "The group had promoted an ambitious goal of raising $8 million.",
    "It has fallen well short so far, raising just $1.9 million.",
    "The rest gets rolled into his general election fund.",
    "First Published April 18, 2022, 9:22am",
    "All three gave $250,000 each."
