    "“We see anywhere between three and four billion dollars annually go across the border into Mexico, into Colombia and into other source countries and supporting the worst criminals in history,” Regan said, citing sources that also estimate as many as 2 million Pennsylvanians use marijuana, far in excess of the 600,000 that can do so legally because they possess medical marijuana cards.",
    "Both believe most people who want to smoke pot will do so whether it’s legal or not, and making it legal — they believe — will make it safer and put money into the hands of domestic producers, retailers, and (because it would be taxed) state government rather than drug traffickers.",
    "John Fetterman (D), who spends about as much time as anyone thinking about the legalization of recreational marijuana, wouldn’t have guessed as recently as 4/20 of 2021 that State Sen. Mike Regan (R-York County) would be sponsoring pro-legalization legislation by 4/20 of 2022.",
    "“And I’ve said, I know we’re different politically on a lot of things, but we both agree on this.”\nOpponents of legalization worry it could cause people who are curious about marijuana but uninterested in violating the law to begin using the drug.",

    "He said the legislation would create a process to ensure Pennsylvanians who are jailed for something that’s no longer a crime will be released from prison and have their records expunged.",
    "Theoretically, only a handful of Republicans in each chamber would need to join Democrats — who have generally been more supportive of legalization — to pass the bill.",
    "His support for the legalization of recreational marijuana is, however, perhaps more important than the support of even an unambiguous pot enthusiast like Fetterman.",
    "Ultimately, GOP leaders in both chambers would decide whether to allow a vote on the bill, which — if it passes — Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, would surely sign.",
    "“I mean, you know, the former U.S. marshal, somebody in really high regard and standing within his caucus” — in other words, among Republican lawmakers.",
    "So we had to Google it and find out exactly what it meant.”\n4/20, for those who (like Regan) weren’t aware, is a reference to marijuana.",
    "So “for somebody like Mike Regan to call it inevitable in Pennsylvania is a dramatic shift for the Republican party,” Fetterman said.",
    "Regan said he’s finalizing his legislation, which will get a hearing in the Pa. Senate’s Law and Justice Committee, which he chairs.",
    "'” Regan said, describing his reaction when his chief of staff told him the media were interested in speaking with him on 4/20 Day.",
    "Regan and Fetterman cite mostly similar reasons for their support of legalization for people 21 and over.",
    "Regan says if (from the perspective of supporters) all goes well, legalization could happen by June 30.",
