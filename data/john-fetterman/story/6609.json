    "So when we say there are 30,000 infections a day, there's probably closer to a quarter of a million infections a day…[but] I don't think it's going to become a nationalized epidemic of BA.2\" pic.twitter.com/VOiFAfKKRH\n— JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) April 11, 2022",
    "One woman who describes herself as “far-left” on global warming and gay rights is voting Republican this year, she told the Journal, because she believes in “my body, my choice” across the board — not just on abortion but on masks and vaccine mandates.",
    "More:\nWatching her daughter fall behind in virtual kindergarten, Ms. Loughran had grown so frustrated not knowing when her children would return to the classroom that she joined a group that attracted right-leaning parents in its school-reopening push.",
    "Your must-read of the day is this WSJ piece about longtime Democratic voters in New Jersey who’ve experienced various degrees of political “awakening” in frustration at their party’s itchy trigger finger on closing schools and mandating masks.",
    "Cases in Philly are up over the past month, but let’s keep “up” in perspective:\nAlthough cases have doubled in the past three weeks, they’re at less than five percent of the peak during the Omicron wave this past winter.",
    "In this case, an increase of more than 50 percent in cases over a 10-day span triggers “Level 2” in Philly, which means masks are now required indoors again — just a month after the mandate was finally relaxed.",
    "That would serve the public health interest of alerting the locals that the risk of a new wave has grown while still observing a post-pandemic degree of “normalcy” by not formally reimplementing restrictions.",

    "This announcement comes on a day when hospitalizations in Pennsylvania are the lowest they’ve been since last July and deaths are the lowest they’ve been since last August.",
    "A reasonable compromise position to me would be to have the commissioner hold a press conference encouraging masking due to the rise of cases but not requiring it.",
    "In order to provide a one-week education period for businesses, masks will be required in all indoor public spaces as of Monday, April 18, 2022.",
    "On the one hand, he thinks we’re badly undercounting the true number of infections as Americans forgo PCR lab tests for unreported rapid tests.",
