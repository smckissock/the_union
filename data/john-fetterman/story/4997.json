Connor Lamb — largely agree on such issues as support for Israel, the need to ban assault weapons and climate change, but explained the nuances of how their policies differ during an April 14 online forum organized by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Democratic Jewish Outreach Pennsylvania.",
    "Considering the recent terrorist attacks in Israel, he said, it is imperative that Pennsylvania’s next senator “be outspoken and reaffirm our special relationship between the United States and Israel.” He highlighted his time as an anti-bias trainer with the Anti-Defamation League and said it is important to end antisemitism and racism.",
    "“Now is the time we need to double down and move as quickly as possible to greener forms of clean energy.”\nLamb said the issue will be best addressed through national security and that it should be confronted the same way the space race was in the 1960s and the Manhattan Project before it.",

    "Asked if they supported the Iran nuclear deal, Kenyatta called former President Trump’s policy of maximum pressure “maximum stupidity.” He said he supported the efforts to rejoin the agreement to ensure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.",
    "“There is no rational reason why we should allow civilians to own weapons of mass death,” Fetterman said, arguing that this was another issue that could be addressed with the elimination of the filibuster.",

    "Lamb also said he supports raising the minimum wage as well as President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Plan: better health care, child tax credits and climate change legislation.",

    "In a theme that has become common since 2018, Soifer asked if, in light of the massacre at the Tree of Life building, the candidates supported an assault gun ban.",
