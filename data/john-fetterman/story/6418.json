    "Ours was about ‘My Country ‘Tis of Thee.’\n“It never aired because we got the call from Garry about ‘Happy Days,’ and for the next long while, I was Shirley Feeney.”\nAsked the de rigueur question about whether being Shirley for eight seasons affected her being chosen to to do other work, Williams was to the point.",
    "I worked with people over the telephone and on Zoom, but we got it done.”\n“It” includes Williams talking about some “B” movies she made, such as “Beware the Blob” and “The Kelly Kid,” and titles she says are a ‘mouthful.’\nShirley, from “Laverne and Shirley” is one of the title characters in the show.",
    "“Now, there’s ‘Me, Myself, and Shirley,’ so the story goes on.”\n‘Factual’ election ads\nWhile doing some personal research to prepare for next month’s Pennsylvania primary elections, I happened across a type of story and style of reporting I hadn’t seen for a while and welcomed.",
