    "Sean Hannity, Melania, Rudy Giuliani, Ted Nugent, Wilbur Ross, John Catsimatidis, Steve Wynn, Michael Rubin and Nelson Peltz have been pressing Trump to endorse Oz, while Mike Pompeo, Hope Hicks, Larry Kudlow, Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Ted Cruz have lined up behind David McCormick.",
