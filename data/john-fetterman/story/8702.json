    "But the fact that John Fetterman thinks only Fox News Republicans oppose socialism, defunding the police, and banning all private health insurance shows how out of touch he is with reality and why the Republicans are dying to run against him in the fall.”\nThe Fetterman campaign pointed out Tuesday that the NPR article referenced by the PAC’s ad — labeling Mr. Fetterman a “self-described socialist” — was corrected to say, “This story wrongly states that Pennsylvania Lt. Gov.",
    "“They're attacking John because they know if he wins, they lose.”\nAlleging that Mr. Lamb has decided to “run like a Republican” because he hasn’t gained ground with Democrats, the Fetterman campaign sought to link the super PAC to Mr. Lamb himself, even though the PAC — Penn Progress — is run independently of the congressman’s campaign.",
    "John Fetterman is a ‘self-described Democratic socialist.’ He is not.”\nMr. Lamb has insisted he’s the candidate who has what it takes to win tough races — he’s done it before — and that he can speak to rural Pennsylvanians in ways that other Democrats can’t because he has the right message and the record in Congress to back it up.",
    "In another shot lobbed the frontrunner’s way, a super PAC supporting Mr. Lamb went up with a TV advertisement on Tuesday calling Mr. Fetterman a “risk we can’t afford,” pointing to news articles that called him a “self-described Democratic socialist” and a “silver spoon socialist.” Politico first reported the advertisement.",
    "In a debate this past weekend at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Mr. Lamb and Mr. Kenyatta repeatedly poked fun at the empty lectern beside them — where Mr. Fetterman would have stood had he attended — and said he wasn’t a serious candidate, unwilling to have tough conversations.",
    "Broken down by quarter, Mr. Fetterman raised $3.9 million (Jan. 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021), $2.5 million (April 1 to June 30, 2021), $2.7 million (July 1 to Sept. 30, 2021), $2.7 million (Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2021) and $3.1 million (Jan. 1 to March 31, 2022.)",
    "Mr. Fetterman’s first-quarter numbers, announced by the campaign in the leadup to the new federal filing deadline, would be the largest amount he’s raised in a single quarter since the quarter in which he launched early last year.",
    "insiders” who attack Mr. Fetterman because he is not “one of them.”\n“John doesn't spend his time backslapping with lobbyists and doing the bidding of rich donors like other politicians,” spokesman Joe Calvello said.",
    "Last November, he tweeted, “If you want a Senator who runs as a Socialist, feeds the GOP attack ads, & didn't help with infrastructure, I'M NOT YOUR GUY.”\n“That's not how you beat Republicans.",
    "John Fetterman’s run for the U.S. Senate brought in $3.1 million in the first few months of 2022, pushing his total haul since the beginning of his campaign to the $15 million mark.",
    "Calling for a “new day” in politics, Mr. Kenyatta’s pitch is that he understands the lives of working-class Pennsylvanians because he’s lived it himself and knows their struggles.",
    "“It’s clear that John is a unique candidate who has deep, enthusiastic, and engaged support, the kind of support Democrats need in 2022 if they are going to turn this seat blue.",
    "For now, Mr. Fetterman’s campaign says the average donation this quarter was $29 and that it continued its streak of not accepting any money from political action committees.",
    "More specific details on Mr. Fetterman’s fundraising quarter will be available by April 15, the deadline for campaigns to submit reports to the Federal Election Commission.",
    "Mr. Fetterman’s campaign said he’s committed to three televised debates before the primary, but didn’t give an explanation as to why he didn’t attend that specific debate.",
    "Mr. Lamb’s campaign manager, Abby Nassif-Murphy, told Politico that the PAC’s messaging — incoming, according to reporting at the time — “did not come from our campaign.",
    "Our supporters and donors know and believe in John, and they know he can win,” said Rebecca Katz, a senior adviser to the campaign.",
    "The Fetterman campaign claimed a “dominant financial advantage” and said the amount shows his support continuing to grow.",
    "Recent polling has shown a three-way race, with Mr. Fetterman holding a sizable lead over U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt.",
    "Continuing its reign as one of the most well-funded primary campaigns in the country, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov.",
    "His campaign said he has $4.1 million cash on hand entering the final stretch before the May 17 primary.",
