    "Prosecutors began Monday whittling down a group of 200 Fulton County residents to the 23 they need to serve on a special grand jury that will investigate whether former President Donald Trump should be charged for his attempts to pressure Georgia officials to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost.",
    "Willis notified at least four state officials of her investigation in February 2021, sending document preservation notices to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Attorney General Chris Carr.",
    "As the selection process began, Judge Robert McBurney encouraged prospective grand jurors to identify themselves as having a \"conflict\" if they have already reached a conclusion about whether Trump committed a crime in the aftermath of his defeat.",
    "Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis asked a panel of judges in January for the special grand jury because of \"information indicating a reasonable probability\" that the election \"was subject to possible criminal disruptions.\"",
    "A spokesperson for Trump claimed Friday in a text to CBS News that an \"illegal ballot trafficking ring\" had influenced the outcome of Georgia's election, referring to unproven claims often made by Trump and his supporters.",
    "\"Because this grand jury will be investigating a specific situation, the 2020 election here in Georgia, it's important that the grand jury be comprised of individuals who bring an open mind to the process,\" McBurney said.",
    "Willis has said in interviews that the investigation includes a January 2, 2021 phone call in which Trump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, \"I just want to find 11,780 votes.\"",
    "Willis wrote in the request that \"a significant number of witnesses and prospective witnesses have refused to cooperate with the investigation absent a subpoena requiring their testimony.\"",
    "They focus on just one investigation, and can be impaneled for far longer than typical grand juries, which often consider charging recommendations for a variety of investigations.",
    "Willis said in an April 19 interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that she will wait until after the state's May 24 primaries to issue subpoenas to public officials.",
    "McBurney told jurors that they can expect their service to be lengthy, potentially even more than a year  sometimes meeting frequently, and sometimes less so.",
    "This grand jury will have \"an investigatory focus appropriate to the complexity of the facts and circumstances involved,\" Willis said in her January request.",
    "\"I don't want anyone to say 'oh, she's doing this because she wants to influence the outcome of this upcoming election,'\" Willis told the newspaper.",
    "\"A grand jury should be opened for the massive voter fraud in Georgia in 2020,\" said Liz Harrington, the Trump spokesperson.",
    "Trump said in a January 20 statement that \"My phone call to the Secretary of State of Georgia was perfect.\"",
    "Trump lost the state to Joe Biden by that margin  an outcome that was affirmed by several recounts.",
    "Willis spoke very briefly Monday, thanking those in attendance for their potential service.",
    "Contact Graham at KatesG@cbsnews.com or grahamkates@protonmail.com",
    "He said they may not have their first hearing until June.",
    "Three additional people will be selected as alternates.",
    "Special grand juries are unusual."
