    "But even after the 15th Amendment officially gave them that right, she said, Black people who wanted to exercise their right to vote were intimidated, beaten, sometimes killed.?\nWe see kind of a new generation of retrenchment and tools being employed across the country,? Ms. Archer added, citing the example of gerrymandering, which reduces Black voters' representation in Congress and state legislatures.",
    "But to break the opportunity for the minority to participate completely  that's just not who we are.?\nAs part of the effort to win their backing, Democrats on Tuesday brought in two Harvard professors, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, the authors of How Democracies Die,? for a luncheon presentation on their book exploring how political leaders can gradually subvert democracy to solidify their power.",
    "Let the majority prevail, and if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.?\nMr. Biden's visit to Georgia was intended to invigorate a Democratic-led effort to pass new voting rights protections in the 50-50 Senate in the coming days, although chances are slim that he will be able to rally the necessary votes.",
    "There is nothing normal about a law that makes it illegal to pass out water or food to people standing in long voting lines.?\nRepublicans, in resisting both new Democratic voting rights laws and calls to change Senate rules to enact them, have argued that Democrats are exaggerating the impact of new voting restrictions in Republican-led states in order to justify a blatant power grab.",

    "By some measures, the filibuster is used as much as 10 times today compared to the past decade.?\nThe threat to force through a rules change on a partisan vote has touched off a strong response from Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, who has accused Mr. Schumer, his counterpart, of trying to wreck the Senate for partisan gain.",
    "But unless the changes can attract the 67 votes usually needed to change Senate rules  a highly unlikely scenario given strident Republican opposition  the only way to achieve that change is through what is known as the nuclear option.? In that scenario, Democrats would stage a series of votes on the floor to overrule Senate precedents on a strictly partisan vote.",

    "This is nothing short of a federal elections takeover.?\nMr. Raffensperger's comments, at a news conference at the State Capitol, came a few hours before Mr. Biden was expected to give a speech calling for a limited change to the Senate's filibuster rule and calling upon Congress to pass new voting rights legislation favored by Democrats.",

    "The marches will take place across bridges  a reference to the 1965 civil rights clash on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., but also an attempt to contrast Mr. Biden's success in passing a bipartisan infrastructure package that will invest in roads and bridges with the failure to pass legislation on voting rights.",
    "One bill introduced by Democrats, the Freedom to Vote Act, would, among other provisions, take the teeth out of state-led efforts to restrict mail-in or absentee voting, make Election Day a holiday, and stop state legislators from redrawing districts in a way that advocates say denies representation to minority voters.",

    "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\nMore than 55 years ago, men, women and children marched from Selma to Montgomery to demand the ballot, and when they arrived at the State Capitol in Alabama, Dr. King decried what he called normalcy  the normalcy, the complacency that was denying people the freedom to vote,? she said.",
