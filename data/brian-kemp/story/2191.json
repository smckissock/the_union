    "Trump's obsession with the 2020 election results may be so troubling to Georgia conservatives because many believe it already cost them the two Senate races last January, as a significant chunk of the MAGA faithful may have stayed home after buying into Trump's claims that the state's voting systems were rigged.",

    "Trump is now throwing his weight behind Herschel Walker in the Republican Senate primary and David Perdue in the gubernatorial primary in an effort to turn the state MAGA this November.",
    "Herschel is laser-focused on winning the primary in May and the general in November,? Mallory Blount, a spokeswoman for the Walker campaign, told the outlet when reached for comment.",
    "Perdue is now running to take down Governor Brian Kemp, whom Trump despises because he didn't make more of an effort to illegally overturn the state's 2020 election results.",
    "Trump, however, is laser-focused on getting revenge on Kemp, regardless of how it may impact the party's chances of retaining the governor's mansion.",
    "Folks, he can't win in November,? Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, one of Walker's Republican challengers, said earlier this week.",
