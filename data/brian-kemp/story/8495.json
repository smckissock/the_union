    "The orthodoxy about the stolen election forces Republican politicians to say something that is untrue and most know to be untrue; it institutionalizes a politics of cynicism and fear  fear both of Trump and his voters; it detracts from a focus on the ongoing failures of Joe Biden; and it isnt helpful in winning over swing voters.",
    "Together with former Vice President Mike Pence, whose separation from Trump is more and more obvious, they form a cadre that resisted intense pressure to turn their backs on their duty in 2020  showing backbone and a moral and institutional integrity that will redound to their credit in the history books.",
    "Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had provoked Trumps ire by refusing to indulge his delusions about the 2020 election or engage in any legally dubious maneuvers to change the result in Georgia, and they had felt the full fury of the White House and Mar-a-Lago.",
    "So, he coaxed Jones into the primary for the 10th congressional district, and then got one of his former advisers, Patrick Witt, out of the congressional primary and into a primary against the Kemp-selected incumbent insurance commissioner.",
    "Its possible to read too much into Kemp and Raffenspergers victories, which would have been difficult to pull off without the advantages of incumbency and of flawed opponents, while Pence will have much to overcome if he runs in 2024.",
    "If Trump had been rationally calculating his interests, he would have thought twice about making his signature project in the 2022 primary season a challenge to an entrenched, politically shrewd governor.",
    "It is not often that politicians do the right thing and infuriate the most influential figure in their party and the most committed element of their political base and live to tell the tale.",
    "Republican primary voters in Georgia clearly favored moving beyond an all-consuming focus on 2020 and opposed Trump continuing to make the state his political plaything.",
    "Trump wanted to get state Rep. Vernon Jones out of the gubernatorial primary to make way for his preferred candidate, former Sen. David Perdue.",
    "But in refusing to play by the rules as set by Trump, they have shown courage that should be encouraging to others in the party.",
    "Instead, he pulled the strings to create a state-wide vengeance slate challenging everyone from Kemp on down.",
    "They also point to a future when the GOP has escaped the box canyon of Trumps Stop the Steal obsessions.",
    "Unlike Earp and his posse, though, Trump didnt get his man or any of his confederates, and Gov.",
    "The tale of the tape is that Perdue got 21.8% of the vote, Jones got 21.6%, and Witt got 16.7%.",
    "That day is not here, but Tuesdays results show it might not be impossibly far away either.",
    "Corral, Donald Trump and his allies mounted up for a vendetta ride in Georgia.",
    "Trump has catalyzed some healthy and useful changes in the GOP.",
    "A daily roundup of the day's top opinion and editorial pieces.",
    "Brian Kemp and Co. didnt even have to leave the territory.",
    "Rich Lowry is editor-in-chief of the National Review.",
    "Like Wyatt Earp after the gunfight at the O.K.",
    "The blight is his fixation with 2020 .",
    "Kemp and Raffensperger have.",
