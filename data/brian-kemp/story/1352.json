    "If the Vice President (Mike Pence) had absolutely no right' to change the Presidential Election results in the Senate, despite fraud and many other irregularities, how come the Democrats and RINO Republicans, like Wacky Susan Collins, are desperately trying to pass legislation that will not allow the Vice President to change the results of the election?? Trump said in a press release issued the evening of Sunday, January 30. Actually, what they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away.",
    "If the Electoral Count Act were revised to state explicitly that the vice president is not the arbiter, but instead plays a purely ministerial role, it would not in any way concede that Mike Pence  or former vice president Al Gore or current vice president Kamala Harris, for that matter  had the near-dictatorial authority, in Trump's words, to overturn the Election!?\nA second provision of ECA reform will likely raise the threshold that triggers congressional debate for challenges to the counting of Electoral College votes.",
    "If people in the system  politicians  are eager to play a corrupt role and deny the results of an election, there's only so much that a law written in advance can really do to stop it.? Reforms to the Electoral Count Act can perhaps provide a clearer and better process for how electoral disputes are resolved, but the law ultimately can't prevent crises precipitated by politicians who don't respect the rule of law.",
    "And while there is widespread support among Senate Republicans  including Mitch McConnell, Ben Sasse, and Lindsey Graham  for some reform of the Electoral Count Act, that level of support is far from total.?

    "We had an insurrection that happened because of an antiquated law that should have been changed many, many years ago,? West Virginia Democratic senator Joe Manchin told reporters in the Capitol on January 20, the day after he and Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema thwarted Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer's attempt to change Senate filibuster rules.",
    "Let's do what we can do.?\nManchin overstated his case for ECA reform in a couple of key respects: While the ambiguities in the 1887 law contributed to the confusion surrounding Congress's role on January 6, 2021, it is unfair to say that the law caused the mob violence that targeted the peaceful transfer of power.",
    "Unfortunately, he didn't exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!?\nThere are many ambiguities in the Electoral Count Act, but the notion that it gives the vice president the final say over the counting of the Electoral College votes is not one of them.",
