    "According to a 2018 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, dilation and extraction is effective with minimal rates of complications, ranging from 0.05 to 4 percent.? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said the procedure results in fewer medical complications than other abortion procedures, and often is necessary to preserve a woman's health or her future fertility.?\nThey note that attitudes about the pregnancy of unmarried woman have changed drastically; that federal and state laws ban discrimination on the basis of pregnancy; that leave for pregnancy and childbirth are now guaranteed by law in many cases; that the costs of medical care associated with pregnancy are covered by insurance or government assistance.?\nJustice Alito summarized and provided citations to several claims he characterized as policy arguments made by abortion opponents.",
    "The Biden administration, in its brief supporting the abortion providers challenging the Mississippi law, said that overruling Roe and Casey would also threaten the court's precedents holding that the due process clause protects other rights, including the rights to same-sex intimacy and marriage, to interracial marriage and to use contraception.?\nNone of those practices is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution,? the brief said, and most of them were widely prohibited when the 14th Amendment was adopted.?\nThere are limits to analyzing the reasoning of published Supreme Court opinions, to say nothing of drafts, said Michael C. Dorf, a law professor at Cornell.",
    "If the draft or something like it is issued in the coming weeks, he said, it portends big changes because it signals that the five most conservative justices are willing to court controversy on matters they care about.?\nIn the draft opinion, Justice Alito insisted that we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public's reaction to our work.?\nJustice Thomas echoed the point in remarks at a judicial conference in Atlanta on Friday, according to news organizations present.",
    "It found that most abortions after 15 weeks employ dilation and evacuation procedures, which involve the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child,' and it concluded that the intentional commitment of such acts for nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient and demeaning to the medical profession.'?\nDilation and evacuation is the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions, as Justice Alito and the Mississippi Legislature correctly note.",
    "Roe's defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception and marriage,? Justice Alito wrote, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called fetal life' and what the law now before us describes as an unborn human being.'?\nJustice Alito surveyed the precedents cited by Roe and Casey to justify their protection of abortion.",
    "Mr. Manchin, who opposes abortion rights, said the legislation was overly broad, noting that it would go substantially further than simply codifying Roe and warning that it would expand abortion.?\nThe action pushed the issue out of the realm of policymaking in Washington, where congressional Democrats and President Biden now lack a viable legislative path forward to preserve Roe, and to the forefront of the political debate with midterm congressional elections only months away.",
    "The legislation, he said, goes way, way beyond codifying the status quo; it would roll back many existing laws.?\nSenator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who proposed a narrower bill to codify Roe, said the Democratic bill was championed by far-left activists.?\nStill, Democrats were on track to end the day with the headline they wanted voters to read: that Republicans had blocked their effort to safeguard abortion access.",
    "I just think you're dissimilating when you say that any ruling here wouldn't have an effect on those.?\nMr. Stewart tried to distinguish the three other rulings from Roe, saying they were clearer, had given rise to more public reliance and did not involve the purposeful termination of a human life.?\nJustice Sotomayor was unimpressed, saying all of the cases were grounded in the same kind of constitutional reasoning.",
    "With that, that's not where we are today.?\nHe added: It's just disappointing that we're going to be voting on a piece of legislation that I will not vote for today.?\nThe Women's Health Protection Act lays out a lengthy list of prohibited restrictions and limits on abortion, many of which have been enacted by states since Roe was decided, effectively putting abortion nearly or entirely out of reach in some places.",
    "We are not nave to the fact that the filibuster's 60-vote requirement will continue to stall this paramount legislation,? more than 100 House Democrats wrote on Tuesday in a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, adding, The Senate must meet the moment, end the filibuster and pass the Women's Health Protection Act immediately.?\nBut with abortion, there is an added catch.",
    "At the same time, we certainly recognize that the votes  we don't have the votes.?\nIn spite of that, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, with Mr. Biden's support, are pushing ahead with a Senate vote Wednesday afternoon in the hopes of making it clear to voters that Republicans are the ones standing in the way of abortion rights if the Supreme Court ends protections that have been in place for a half century.",
    "Since then, Democrats stripped out a lengthy series of findings, including passages that referred to abortion restrictions as a tool of gender oppression.? They also took out a section clarifying that while the bill referred to women, it was meant to protect the rights of every person capable of becoming pregnant,? including transgender men and nonbinary individuals.",
    "Vote to protect the fundamental rights of women across the country, or stand with five conservative justices ready to destroy these rights in one fell swoop.?\nThe Women's Health Protection Act would have protected abortion access nationwide, going far beyond simply codifying Roe, the landmark Supreme Court decision that in 1973 legalized abortion across the country.",
    "But the Democrats' bill is less specific on when and under what circumstances abortion should remain unregulated; it says generally that any limit on abortion should be allowed only if it significantly advances the safety of abortion services or the health of patients.?\nAnd it is around those types of distinctions that public opinion starts to look more complicated.",
    "In general, Justice Alito wrote that he was wary of attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy,? saying that could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution and the like.?\nNone of these rights has any claim to being deeply rooted in history,? he added, a point that could be made about same-sex marriage, too.",
    "They stripped out a lengthy series of findings, including passages that referred to abortion restrictions as a tool of gender oppression.? Also scrapped was a section clarifying that while the bill referred to women, it was meant to protect the rights of every person capable of becoming pregnant,? including transgender men and nonbinary individuals.",
    "When Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, opened what could be a fateful session of Congress on Wednesday, he declared that it was time for Republicans to stop hiding their views on abortion in what could soon be a post-Roe v. Wade America and put their support for an end to abortion rights on the record.",
    "The legislation is simple: It would declare that states cannot impose an undue burden? on the ability to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability, borrowing key language from Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe two decades earlier.",
    "And in Congress, Republicans were in lock-step opposition to the Democrats' expansive social safety net bill, Build Back Better, that would have created paid family leave for new mothers, greatly offset the cost of child care, and made prekindergarten universal, all measures designed to make having and raising children easier.",
    "It began by noting that, at the time of enactment, only six countries besides the United States permit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion on demand after the 20th week of gestation.'?\nJustice Alito referred to what he called the factual findings? of the Mississippi Legislature that passed the 2018 law challenging Roe.",
    "They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.?\nTellingly, perhaps, that passage in the draft opinion was silent on whether its conclusion undermined the two post-Casey decisions on gay rights.",
    "He called it as extreme as extreme gets.?\nThe top Republican said that Democrats were seeking to go far beyond the limitations on abortion access already accepted across the country, and embracing abortion on demand up to the moment of birth, paid for by taxpayers, and administered by people other than physicians.",
    "Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, used the debate Wednesday over whether to codify an expansive right to abortion to ask members of both parties to focus American politics on what he called an ethic of life?  including more prenatal care and an expanded social safety net for expectant and new mothers.",
    "Democrats tried and failed on Wednesday to push forward legislation to safeguard abortion rights nationwide, as Republicans and one Democrat in the Senate blocked an effort to enshrine the landmark Roe v. Wade precedent in federal law after a leaked Supreme Court opinion suggested it was about to be overturned.",
    "The legislation would also allow courts to consider several factors when deciding whether a restriction would infringe on abortion rights, including whether it would increase the costs of providing or obtaining abortion services, such as those associated with travel, child care or taking time off from work.",
    "One of the steps we've said we've been taking all along is having the Gender Policy Council, our counsel's office, and the Department of Health and Human Services come up with options and proposals for what we would do were this opinion issued to be final or a version of it to be final,? she said Tuesday.",
    "For the claim about guaranteed leave, he pointed to a federal law requiring businesses with 50 employees or more to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid family and medical leave, as well as data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that nearly 90 percent of workers had access to unpaid leave.",
    "Democrats would seem to have the upper hand, with polls showing a large percentage of Americans opposing the overturning of the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent, previewed by the extraordinary leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would end a right enjoyed by women for nearly half a century.",
    "Even as they work to avoid a backlash against their party ahead of the midterms, Republicans did not shy away from the abortion debate on Wednesday, seeking to cast the bill as radical and describing Democrats' goal as legalizing abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy with no limits.",
    "For all his forthright talk on what is and is not an acceptable limit on a woman's right to end a pregnancy, Mr. McConnell opened his remarks on Wednesday with an extended broadside on what he called President Biden's failure to take responsibility for the soaring cost of everyday living.",
    "Fifty-three percent in the survey said the decision to have an abortion belongs solely to the pregnant woman.?\nBut 43 percent of those surveyed said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases at 24 weeks of pregnancy  when the fetus can survive outside the womb with medical support.",
    "Sixty percent of all those surveyed said that doctors who perform abortions where they are illegal should be prosecuted, and about half of those surveyed  and close to twice as many Republicans as Democrats  said that women who seek abortions where they are illegal should face penalties.",
    "Public opinion polls suggest support for the general aims of the Women's Health Protection Act, which Democrats in the Senate plan to vote on Wednesday: A majority of Americans support the right to an abortion, a trend that has held true since before the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.",
    "The governor of Mississippi, Tate Reeves, took to the Sunday political shows this past weekend to make the case that his state, whose abortion law is expected to be the vehicle for overturning Roe, would follow the Supreme Court decision with laws to promote adoption and child care.",
    "Another 22 percent say it depends.?\nBoth sides of the abortion debate anticipate that come June, the Supreme Court will have overturned Roe v. Wade and with it the constitutional right to abortion, handing anti-abortion activists a victory they have sought for five decades.",

    "WASHINGTON  President Biden on Wednesday strongly urged the Senate to pass legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into law even as administration officials acknowledged that the bill does not have the support of enough lawmakers to pass and is unlikely to reach his desk.",
    "Senator Joe Manchin III, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia who opposes abortion rights, said Wednesday that he would break with his party and vote against taking up a bill to enshrine those rights in federal law, arguing that the legislation was overly broad.",
    "But if Democrats were able to abolish the filibuster and then pass legislation safeguarding abortion rights at the federal level, there would be nothing to stop a Republican president and Republican majorities in Congress from enacting a national ban in the future.",
    "Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, called the vote one of the most important we've taken in decades.?\nBefore the day is over, every member of this body will make a choice,? Mr. Schumer said Wednesday morning from the Senate floor.",
    "In a brief submitted on behalf of Mississippi, a European Christian group claimed the majority of European countries allow abortion after the gestational limit only under exceptional circumstances? like rape or incest, fetal abnormalities or danger to the mother.",
    "Mr. Manchin's opposition does not change the outcome of Wednesday's vote; even if every Democrat supported the Women's Health Protection Act, they were still all but certain to fall short of the 60 votes needed to advance it over unified Republican opposition.",
    "While his opposition was not a surprise, some of his colleagues had seen a glimmer of hope earlier in the week that Mr. Manchin might come around, when he said he would wait and see? what his colleagues had to say about the bill before deciding how to vote.",
