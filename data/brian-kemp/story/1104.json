    "More so than in any other state, Trump has dived into politics in Georgia by encouraging and selecting a slate of six loyal candidates to run for offices at the top of the ballot in this year's midterm elections, some of whom are challenging members of his own party and all of whom are dedicated to the baseless proposition that the last election was stolen from him in the state.",
    "The problem [Trump] has in Georgia is that, outside of his frustration with the election, all these Republican officeholders, especially the governor, have done a really good job according to what a conservative would think would be a good job,? Williams said, pointing to Kemp's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his economic agenda.",

    "As far as the races farther down the ballot, this person said that while Trump's endorsement is the most powerful? in GOP politics, it's not the only message they need to get out.?\nBut for Trump, this Perdue ally said, whether the primary is a win for him will come down to Perdue's performance.",
    "I think it's going to be problematic for him, because he's going to be working against people that have a lot of support,? Williams said in an interview, saying he believes Trump's best chance to unseat an incumbent comes in the race for secretary of state between Hice and Raffensperger.",
    "Republican consultant John Porter, who worked for Duncan and represents lieutenant governor candidate Butch Miller, said Trump is still popular in the party, but his favorability ratings are slowly and marginally coming down, while his unfavorability numbers are rising.",
    "If they triumph in the primaries and are elected in November, all but one of the candidates would be in positions to use their offices in 2024 to help Trump mount election challenges, assuming he runs again for president and ends up in another nail-biter.",
