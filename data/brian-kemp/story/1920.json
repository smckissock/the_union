    "Brian Kemp holds a more than 20-point lead in the Republican gubernatorial primary race against former Sen. David Perdue (Ga.), according to a new poll by the University of Georgia's School of Public and International Affairs on behalf of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.",
    "Look, I was as frustrated as anybody else.?\nIn the poll, 87 percent said election security was extremely or very important, while almost 60 percent are very or somewhat confident the 2020 elections were conducted fairly and accurately.",
    "The only reason I'm not in the United States Senate is because you caved in and gave the election to  liberal Democrats,? Perdue, who lost his Senate seat to now-Sen. Jon Ossoff (D), said to Kemp during the debate.",
    "During the debate, Perdue continued to peddle the false claim made by former President Trump that the 2020 election was stolen and blamed Kemp for Democrats having control of the White House and Senate.",
    "The poll's results were released two days after Kemp and Perdue had a debate defined by their differences of opinion regarding the 2020 presidential election and its aftermath.",
    "The primary will take place May 24, with the winner moving on to face Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who lost to Kemp in a hotly contested campaign in 2018.",
    "Kemp has drawn the ire Trump and those who falsely believe the election was stolen for certifying the election results in Georgia, denying Trump's request to reject them.",
    "The poll, which surveyed likely Republican primary voters, found that 53 percent of voters support Kemp in the race, while 26 percent support Perdue.",
    "Similar results occur when asked whether respondents approve of the men, with Kemp's favorable rating at 71 percent and Perdue's at 57 percent.",
    "I've always said there's fraud in every election, and when I was secretary of state, I went after it,? Kemp said on Sunday.",
    "The Hill has removed its comment section, as there are many other forums for readers to participate in the conversation.",
    "With the May 24 primary drawing near, Kemp has consistently polled as the favorite in the GOP field.",
    "Weak leaders blame everybody else for their own loss instead of themselves,? Kemp fired back.",
    "The poll was conducted April 10-22 among 886 likely Republican primary voters.",
    "We invite you to join the discussion on Facebook and Twitter.",
    "The margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.",
    "I didn't say there wasn't problems in this election.",
    "Georgia Gov."
