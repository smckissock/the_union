    "Jones and other federal judges have been reluctant to order last-minute changes, noting that the Supreme Court has repeatedly said federal judges shouldn't alter rules on the eve of an election.?\nIn the months preceding the 2018 election, Abrams, a Democrat, accused her Republican opponent in the governor's race, then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp, of using his position as Georgia's chief elections officer to promote voter suppression, an allegation Kemp has vehemently denied.",
    "Lawyers for the state argue the claims in the lawsuit are not supported by the evidence.? The number, geographic scope and severity of the alleged problems experienced by voters identified by the plaintiffs do not rise to a level sufficient to demonstrate an unconstitutional burden on voting in Georgia,? state lawyers wrote in a filing.",

    "The lawsuit originally called for a sweeping overhaul of the state's elections, but its scope was considerably narrowed after the state made changes that addressed some allegations and others were dismissed by the court.",
    "The plaintiffs say data entry errors or differences as minor as a missing hyphen or apostrophe can trigger a non-match and that naturalized citizens can also be wrongly flagged as noncitizens if records are outdated.",
    "The plaintiffs claim that Georgia's secretary of state and State Election Board members are denying and abridging Georgians' right to vote? in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the U.S. Constitution.",
    "Under the exact match? policy, information from voter registration applications is checked against information held by the state Department of Driver Services or the federal Social Security Administration.",
    "Her 3-year stolen election' campaign has been nothing more than a political stunt to keep her in the national spotlight, and it's a disservice to Georgia voters,? he said in an emailed statement.",
    "The statewide voter registration database is error-ridden,? the plaintiffs say, resulting in the erroneous deletion of eligible voters' registration or critical information being incorrect.",
    "Fair Fight says it works to promote voting rights and support progressive candidates around the country, and its PAC has raised more than $100 million since its founding.",
    "The issues remaining for the trial have to do with the exact match? policy, the statewide voter registration list and in-person cancellation of absentee ballots.",
    "In February 2021, Jones threw out parts of the lawsuit, saying some allegations were made irrelevant by changes in state law or the plaintiffs' lack of standing.",
    "Meanwhile, Abrams, a state lawmaker who was little known outside Georgia when she ran four years ago, has become a household name and Democratic Party star.",

    "When she ended her first bid to become Georgia governor in 2018, Stacey Abrams announced plans to sue over the way the state's elections were managed.",
    "In the more than three years since that fiercely fought contest captured national attention, the focus on Georgia's elections has only intensified.",
    "The only Democrat running for governor, she'll face Kemp again in November if he fends off a primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue.",
    "Among them were some of the claims about voting machines and election technology, as well as the security of voter lists and polling place issues.",

    "Republicans in Georgia this year passed legislation to let the Georgia Bureau of Investigation initiate probes into alleged election wrongdoing.",

    "Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger accused Abrams and her allies of trying to undermine the integrity of Georgia elections.",
    "That can prevent eligible voters from being able to vote or force them to overcome undue burdens to do so, the plaintiffs say.",
    "Even if U.S. District Judge Steve Jones sides with the plaintiffs, it's unclear whether that will affect elections this year.",
