    "During his speech introducing Trump at a rally last month in Johnston County, Hines said he was running for office because, I will not sit idly by on the sidelines and watch radical, Marxist leftists destroy our country for the next generation.?\nEchoing a line of attack he has deployed against Daughtry, he continued, I also will not stand for cowardly, RINO Republicans that seek to dismantle the America First movement.?\nA few weeks earlier, in another podcast interview with Matt Beaudreau, a self-improvement guru, Hines passed along some wisdom he had absorbed during his career thus far.",
    "Republican National Committee spokesman Garrison Douglas called the senator's vote disgusting,? adding, Raphael Warnock's vote today proves that there is no limit to how far he will go to support Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer's radical agenda.?\nThe anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List also issued a statement attacking the senator, calling him an extremist.?\nOur field team is visiting hundreds of thousands of Georgia voters to educate them about Warnock's record and ensure he is held accountable on election night,? the group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in the statement.",
    "Pennsylvania is not real good about that extreme on either side,? said Rob Gleason, a former Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman, who was one of Mr. Trump's chief supporters in the state in 2016 but now worries about Mr. Mastriano in 2022. No matter what you say, it's kind of a down-the-middle type of a state.?\nIn Pennsylvania, the governor appoints the secretary of state, the position that oversees state elections, meaning whoever wins the governorship will be overseeing the administration of one of the most coveted swing states in the 2024 presidential race.",
    "The worst election integrity' governor in the country, Brian Kemp, loaded the great state of Georgia up with RINOs,? Mr. Trump said in a statement on Wednesday, using the term for Republicans in name only.? That tells you all you need to know about what you are getting in Georgia  just a continuation of bad elections and a real RINO if you vote for Brian Kemp.?\nMr. Christie, who has publicly rebuked Mr. Trump for failing to produce evidence of a stolen election, mocked the former president's statement and said he was proud to support Mr. Kemp.",
    "To date, Ms. Barnette's growth has been almost entirely organic, fueled by her sharp debate performances, conservative media appearances and compelling life story, which she told in her book, Nothing to Lose, Everything to Gain: Being Black and Conservative in America.?\nA byproduct of a rape,? as she describes herself, when her mother was only 11, Ms. Barnette talks about growing up on a pig farm? in Alabama without running water and how her success represents the kind of American dream story that is now at risk.",
    "It's just Summer Lee in Congress would be a lone voice holding out to make a point and advance the liberal cause, whereas Steve Irwin is a progressive but he wants to work with President Biden to actually get things done.?\nThere are important policy differences, including issues like student loan forgiveness and climate change and fighting corporate polluters, where Summer clearly has a more progressive record and different stance than Steve Irwin,? Gardner said.",
    "No exceptions.?\nAlthough Hines previously spoke of Cawthorn in glowing terms  hailing him as a steadfast leader in the conservative movement,? appearing in Instagram posts together and highlighting his endorsement  he has lately sought to distance himself from the congressman, who has alienated many Republicans in Washington and in North Carolina with his claims that lawmakers had used cocaine and had orgies, his cavalier driving habits and a leaked nude video.",
    "They see through that.?\nTo other young people seeking to enter the political arena, he advised, Make sure you know what you believe before you try to tell others what to believe.?\nAs Democrats barrel into an intense few weeks of primaries, these races will offer a window into the mood of the party's voters who are alarmed by the threat to abortion rights and frustrated by gridlock in Washington, Katie Glueck reports.",

    "They don't know our values here in Bucks County.?\nERIE, Pa.  Republican voters in Pennsylvania, one of the nation's most hotly contested political battlegrounds, appear to be rallying behind two hard-right candidates for governor and the Senate who are capturing grass-roots anger, railing against the party's old guard and amplifying Donald Trump's stolen-election myth.",
    "Some Republicans in deep-red Johnston County, a fast-growing rural community, have criticized Hines for, in the words of one local group's leader, coming in, just trying to cherry-pick a district he can win.? And Hines's main opponent, a lawyer named Kelly Daughtry who is the daughter of a former majority leader of the State House, has attacked him as a carpetbagger.",
    "It hasn't really worked out very well.?\nIn the governor's race, the presumptive Democratic nominee, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, began running television ads last week featuring a narrator touting Mr. Mastriano's conservative credentials: If Mastriano wins, it's a win for what Donald Trump stands for.? Mr. Trump has not endorsed in that contest.",
    "Maybe the R' in RINO really stands for re-elected.?\nNEWTOWN, Pa.

    "Charles Hellwig, a Republican political consultant who is advising Daughtry, said he expected the race to be close, but he noted, Trump backed by money is a pretty potent combination in a Republican primary.?\nMake sure you know what you believe'\nHines has described his political philosophy in different terms over the years.",

    "Georgia Republicans have made the issue their latest line of attack, focusing their fire on freshman Senator Raphael D. Warnock, a Democrat and self-proclaimed pro-choice pastor.?\nLegislation that would outlaw abortion after six weeks of pregnancy is almost certain to become law in Georgia if Roe v. Wade is overturned.",
    "The question for Hines is whether Trump's endorsement and the Club for Growth's advertisements are enough to put him over the top, while Daughtry's campaign is hoping that her local bona fides and success as a lawyer will appeal to the sorts of older party stalwarts who tend to show up to vote in primary elections.",
    "That assessment conflicts with the approach of Mr. Trump  who has continued to push false claims that he won the 2020 presidential contest  and created a major fault line inside the party that was exposed again this week as Republican candidates enter the final stretch of the primary race for governor of Georgia.",
    "I'm hoping the Republican Party in the future will not be so bogged down by the 80-year-olds sitting in Congress who want to regulate how people live their lives.?\nThose comments, which the campaign says were taken out of context,? have earned Hines a negative ad from a super PAC supporting one of his opponents.",
    "In the final week, Ms. Barnette is receiving some crucial institutional backing: the endorsement of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List on Tuesday and a $2 million television advertising blitz funded by the Club for Growth, which is broadcasting her up-from-the-bootstraps message statewide.",
    "But, he added, I am very nervous that, lo and behold, two Republican extremists would be elected governor and senator.?\nFor her part, Ms. Barnette, appearing this week on the podcast of Stephen Bannon, the former Trump adviser, dismissed Republican concerns that she was too MAGA? to win in November.",

    "Ms. Barnette has a history of incendiary remarks, including repeatedly calling former President Barack Obama an adherent of Islam, which she said should be banned, and derisively writing about the homosexual agenda.? Both candidates have endorsed each other, forging an important alliance.",
    "It should have maybe happened a little sooner, but there's still time, and that's why I'm encouraging other candidates to do the same.?\nPennsylvania will be home to two of the most critical statewide elections in November, with races for an open Senate seat and an open governor's chair.",
    "The endorsement by Mr. Corman represents the starkest step yet for Republicans in the state who are trying to coalesce support behind one candidate in an effort to halt the current front-runner, Doug Mastriano, a freshmen state senator, before the state's primary on Tuesday.",
    "With less than a week until the state's primary election on Tuesday, polls show that State Senator Doug Mastriano  one of the state's central figures in the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election  has emerged as the clear front-runner in the G.O.P.",
