    "Kemp defeating Perdue also would cast doubt on the efficacy of Trump's continued, unsupported claims that the 2020 election was stolen.",
    "That's certainly the Kemp campaign's interpretation of this latest poll and others that showed the governor with a lead over Perdue.",
    "Among the survey's additional findings:\nRepublican voters with a favorable opinion of Trump prefer Perdue over Kemp, 52% to 39%.",
    "Among the 8 out of 10 Republican voters who said they were extremely? interested in the election, Perdue led Kemp, 49% to 42%.",
