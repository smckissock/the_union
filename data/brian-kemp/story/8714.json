    "\"A share of the Republican electorate still says they don't trust the election system even after the new audit was done in 2021, so it wouldn't take much for Trump to fan those suspicions and reduce the turnout, potentially,\" Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, previously told Newsweek.",
    "Former President Donald Trump's refusal to move on from the 2020 presidential election might backfire for the Republican Party in Georgia, where incumbent GOP Governor Brian Kemp is facing a challenge from Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams.",
    "Trump, however, hasn't backed the Republican nominee, insisting on making Kemp pay for not helping him overturn the results of the 2020 election, when President Joe Biden carried Georgia with a narrow 0.23-point edgeor fewer than 12,000 votesover Trump.",
    "As a result of his primary win, Kemp recently received the support of many of his Republican criticsincluding Perdue and former House Speaker Newt Gingrichas the GOP attempts to rally Georgia Republicans to cast their ballots for Kemp this fall.",
    "While Kemp's victory over Trump-endorsed David Perdue in the primary jeopardized Abrams' chances, the governor could see an unexpected obstacle from voters who have largely disagreed with Abrams' policies.",
    "\"Of course, having [Abrams] I think might be better than having your existing governor, if you want to know the truth,\" Trump told rally attendees in the Peach State last year.",
    "This week, his political action committee sent an email to subscribers claiming that Kemp's win in the Republican primary last week was the result of \"obvious\" voter fraud.",
    "Trump has been steadfast in continuing to push claims of election fraud since losing the White House in 2020, and he extended those assertions into this year's midterms.",
    "And in March of this year, Trump doubled down on his criticism of Kemp, saying at a rally for Perdue that, \"MAGA, Trump voters will not go out and vote for Kemp.",
    "Kemp won in a massive landslide against Perdue with roughly 74 percent of the votean advantage more than 50 points higher than that of his GOP rival.",
    "Trump's supporters being swayed by the former president's opposition of Kemp could be enough to make up the difference by which Abrams lost in 2018.",
    "Despite the threat Trump poses to Kemp, recent polls still suggest that the governor has a lead over Abrams, in the four- to five-point range.",
    "Trump has even gone so far as to suggest to Georgia Republicans that the state would be better off with Abrams in charge than with Kemp.",
    "Biden's victory in 2020 also marked the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state since 1992.",
    "But the Democrat has also been able to close in on Kemp, who had a wider lead before the primary.",
    "Georgia has not been led by a Democratic governor since 2003, when Roy Barnes held office.",
    "If Brian Kemp is renominated, he will go down in flames at the ballot box.\"",
    "Kemp narrowly beat Abrams four years ago by 0.4 points, or 54,723 votes.",
    "\"Stacey, would you like to take his place?\"",
    "\"Might very well be better.\"",
