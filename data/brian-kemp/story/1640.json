    "I find it fascinating, and it speaks less to Stacey Abrams, it really does, than it does what she perceives Joe Biden's political standing to be in the state of Georgia right now,\" Scarborough said.",
    "The MSNBC host then joked that perhaps Abrams is getting her tires rotated and can't skip the critical vehicle maintenance to join Biden as he makes a pitch to the American people.",

    "Politicians don't show up with presidents when their approval ratings may be in the 30s in the state where they want to be elected governor.\"",
    "All the more reason you would think she would be there, unless she thought it didn't help her campaign running for governor of Georgia.\"",
    "An Abrams aide told Fox News she has a conflict but expressed the candidate's support of President Biden.",
    "The media darling has repeatedly insisted her defeat was unfair and rigged by voter suppression.",
    "She announced last month she would run again, setting up a potential rematch with Kemp.",
