    "But he has been entirely consistent on issues since his book Hillbilly Elegy made him famous.",
    "Vance has clearly changed his opinion of Trump, whom he once openly loathed.",
    "The candidate Trump endorsed in a highly competitive primary, author J.D.",
    "This race is almost entirely about the 2020 presidential election.",
    "We might find out as the primary calendar unfolds.",
    "But was it the only reason Vance won?",
