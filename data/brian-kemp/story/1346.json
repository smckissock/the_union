    "A new Trafalgar poll shows incumbent governor Brian Kemp leading GOP primary challenger (and former U.S. senator) David Perdue 49 percent to 39 percent.",
    "The poll is a data point confirming a recent CNN report that Perdue is struggling in the race despite the endorsement of former president Donald Trump.",
    "Trump endorsed Perdue simply because he was angry that Kemp did not attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election in Georgia.",
    "Georgia's law does not offer the governor or the secretary of state the ability to not certify an election,? Axios noted at the time.",
    "All legal challenges to the 2020 election in Georgia have failed.?\nThe primary election in Georgia will be held on May 24.",
    "In December of 2021, Perdue said he would not have certified the 2020 election results in Georgia.",
    "Any challenge to an election's integrity must happen through the courts."
