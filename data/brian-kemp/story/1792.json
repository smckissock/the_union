    "But another one of Trump's favorite candidates, Herschel Walker, looks like a stone-cold lock for the GOP Senate nomination  and Walker is polling consistently closely with Rafael Warnock  sometimes a little ahead of the Democratic incumbent, sometimes a little behind.",
    "There is, er, other big news today, but another poll out this morning shows Georgia governor Brian Kemp not only leading his primary against former senator David Perdue, but well ahead of the 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff.",
    "That comes after yesterday's InsiderAdvantage/FOX 5 Atlanta poll showing Kemp at 54 percent and Purdue at 38 percent, and a late April SurveyUSA poll showing Kemp at 56 percent and Purdue at 31 percent.",
    "Trump endorsed Perdue and raged against Kemp, and this primary isn't looking good for the former president.",
    "The ARW Strategies survey puts Kemp up, 60 percent to 22 percent.",
    "The primary is May 24."
