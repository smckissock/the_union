    "Brian Kemp and his Republican primary challenger, former Sen. David Perdue, but her numbers are still not as horrible as Biden's approval numbers.",
    "Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor in Georgia and has made voting rights? her battle cry, skipped Biden's speech in the state.",
    "Fetterman, Shapiro, and Abrams might have incompetent schedulers, but it's far more likely that they see the writing on the wall.",
    "Just In...\nPresident Joe Biden has become so toxic to voters that swing-state Democrats don't want to be seen with him in public.",
    "Nationally, his approval rating has hit its lowest point in both the RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight polling averages.",
    "In Pennsylvania, Biden went from 44% approval in a June poll from Franklin & Marshall College to an alarming 32% in October.",
    "This was Biden's big speech for Abrams's pet issue, in a state Biden had won in 2020, but she couldn't find time for it.",
    "It's yet another sign of just how badly the 2022 midterm elections are shaping up for the Democratic Party.",
    "This isn't the first time scheduling conflicts? led to swing-state Democrats dodging Biden appearances.",
    "Biden is far more unpopular now than he was when he took 50% of the vote in Pennsylvania.",
    "Abrams is trailing both Gov.",
    "Pennsylvania Lt. Gov.",
    "It's no surprise."
