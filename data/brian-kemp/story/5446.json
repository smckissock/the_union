    "While they attack anyone who has difficulty swallowing the idea that 81 million Americans would vote for a senile old man who was already dumber than Forrest Gump before his dementia kicked in, Stacey gets honorary degrees and is cheered by media types for her struggle for voting rights.?\nSee, its voting rights? when a Democrat questions election results, its a threat to democracy when a Republican does.",
    "It concludes, Please, answer Stacey's call to defend democracy by rushing an emergency donation  whatever you can give  to help us hit our $35,000 fundraising goal to expand our blue firewall, STOP Republican extremism, and elect Democrats across the country!?\nYes, the siren call of Stacey Abrams, patron saint of lying and hypocrisy.",
    "The GOP knows that their extremist agenda isnt popular at the ballot box, but they can't accept the will of the people  so they're SUPPRESSING voters instead!?\nThey never explain how reaching into your pocket to show your drivers license is oppressive, especially? for people of color,? but being Democrats means they dont have to.",
    "Stacey Abrams herself called for grassroots donors like you to take action and give whatever they can  and now, donations are going THROUGH THE ROOF!?\nThey underlined herself,? likely because capitalizing the H? wouldve been a little too on the nose? for them, but theyll get there.",
    "Source: AP Photo/Brynn Anderson\nNot sure if you got your new, Democrat-approved copy of the Bible, the one where Adam and Eve? are replaced by Adam and someone else we cant identify until a biologist comes along,? but in it you will find the new commandments.",
    "Anyway, the blessings of Abrams are more sought after than an audience with the Pope, even by supposed Catholics like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden (when they arent out raising money to fund abortions, like the good, devout Catholics? they are, or something).",
    "They continue, Please, answer Stacey's call and rush a donation before our midnight deadline to keep this momentum going, defeat GOP extremists, and elect Democrats across the country!?\nThis email was sent Saturday, March 26th.",
    "American democracy is under attack right now  perhaps nowhere more so than in Georgia, where Governor Brian Kemp is doing everything he can to make it harder for Georgians to vote  especially people of color.",
    "From January through October of 2021, an off-year, the DGA bragged about raising $54 million, so $35k is just a lie chosen to seem small and attainable, hoping to con suckers into contributing.",
    "Currently, the most pressing commandment is Thou shalt not disappoint Stacey Abrams.?\nAbrams, the current Governor-in-exile of Georgia, is the patron saint of hypocrisy in the Democrat Party.",
    "This is not good,? the subject line reads in a Saturday email from the name Stacey Abrams Alert.?\nDonald Trump is in Georgia RIGHT NOW to hold a rally for one of Staceys far-right opponents.",
    "Shouldnt the alleged piles theyre falling over because Jabba the Governor commanded the peons to tithe be enough, at least for the moment, especially with gas prices and inflation so high?",
    "The Democratic Governors Association, the official party organ created to elect Democrat governors, is invoking Staceys name to dip into the pockets of their idiotic supporters.",
    "There is no deadline anywhere in politics that occurs on a non-end of the month or end of the quarter Saturday, theyre just making it up to give it a sense of urgency.",
    "Its rather odd to me that theyre bragging about how much money theyre raking in  THROUGH THE ROOF!?  while begging people for more.",
    "Our deadline is approaching, and if you dont give by it we could lose everything!? Its a scam, but one they use all the time.",
    "Last year, more than 440 bills that would restrict our right to vote were introduced across the country,? the DGA lies.",
    "Democrats, especially white Democrats, believe black people are idiots who need white liberals to look out for them.",
    "Those commandments are ever-changing, a living document,? if you will, of left-wing mandates and bans of the moment.",
    "You can tell theyre the party of participation trophies and not keeping score by the way they celebrate losers.",
    "In the grand scheme of things, it means nothing, its a tiny amount in national politics.",
    "Silly, Democrats dont give a damn about peoples suffering, they want their money.",
    "The whole damn thing is a scam, and sitting at the front of it is Saint Stacey.",
    "Hes attacking Stacey, and we have to be ready to fight back,? they open.",
    "They pretty much say it out in the open all the time.",
    "Cover the hooker budget for a weekend DGA retreat?",
    "Handle the tip for a Stacey Abrams dinner meeting?",
    "Buy a 30-second ad on a small market TV station?",
    "She is a superhero to the left.",
    "She shall not be displeased!",
    "Then comes the hard push.",
    "Nothing else matters.",
