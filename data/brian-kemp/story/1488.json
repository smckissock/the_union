    "Democrat Stacey Abrams raked in more than $9 million in the two months since she launched her second campaign for Georgia governor, setting a breakneck fundraising pace that far exceeds that of her longtime political foe and potential general election rival, Gov.",
    "Abrams, a voting rights activist and superstar in Democratic circles who came within 55,000 votes of winning the governor's mansion in 2018, is seen as a shoo-in for the party's nomination this year.",
    "His campaign has filed a lawsuit challenging a new law that allows party leaders like Kemp to create so-called leadership committees? that can raise unlimited amounts of money.",
    "Kemp, meanwhile, faces an aggressive primary challenge from former Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who launched his campaign for governor at the behest of former President Trump.",
    "Trump vowed to campaign against Kemp after the Georgia governor rebuffed the former president's pleas to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.",
    "Abrams raised more than $9.25 million since her Dec. 1 announcement, drawing contributions from more than 100,000 donors.",
    "His campaign announced this week that he raised more than $7.4 million between July 1 and Jan. 31.",
    "She has virtually universal name recognition in Georgia and faces no primary competition.",
    "That lawsuit argues that the law gives the incumbent governor an unfair advantage.",
    "She has $7.2 million left in the bank, her campaign said on Wednesday.",
    "Still, Kemp has proved to be a strong fundraiser himself.",
    "Perdue hasn't yet said how much he has raised.",
    "He has more than $12.7 million in the bank.",
    "Brian Kemp (R)."
