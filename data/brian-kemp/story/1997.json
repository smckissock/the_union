    "Cawthorn was responding to a tweet from Robby Starbuck, whose bid for Congress ended when he was removed as a GOP primary candidate by the Tennessee Republican Party on Tuesday.",
    "Since Georgia's 14th Congressional District votes heavily Republican, the GOP is likely to retain Greene's seat even if she is unable to hold office due to the legal challenge.",
