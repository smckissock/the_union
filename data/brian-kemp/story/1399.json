    "So, the idea that Republicans are trying to rile up their base by saying that Stacey Abrams is a hypocrite who you shouldn't follow, what they're hoping is this mobilizes their base and that it discourages or demobilizes her base.?\nThe opposition to Abrams also allows Republicans to talk about something other than Trump's election falsehoods, which carry special resonance in Georgia, where the former president spent his final days in office aiming to pressure officials into reversing Biden's win.",
    "House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted the picture of Abrams and wrote that the same liberal politicians pushing the arbitrary mandates blatantly ignore their own self-imposed rules.?\nThe Republican Governors Association  in the wake of his staunch opposition to school masking rules helping to lift Republican Glenn Youngkin to an upset victory in the Virginia governor's race last fall  hustled out a digital ad built around the Abrams picture.",
    "But it looks like they wouldn't apply when she's attending a photo op.? Perdue tweeted that liberals' thirst for power during this pandemic has caused enormous damage to our kids, while the elite like Stacey continue living their lives.?\nThe response was a notable moment of alignment in a state where former President Donald Trump's election lies have divided the GOP, fueling Perdue's unusual challenge to an incumbent from his own party.",
    "But in an interview Tuesday on CNN, Abrams said, Protocols matter and protecting our kids is the most important thing, and anything that can be perceived as undermining that is a mistake and I apologize.?\nAbrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo had said it was shameful? to use a Black History Month event for a false political attack.?\nStill, in a sign of her national political profile, Republicans around the country have piled on.",
    "But, at the same time, it never hurts either of them to be drawing a contrast with Stacey Abrams and reminding the base what's at stake.?\nThe photo is an unhelpful development for Abrams, whose national stature has skyrocketed in recent years from a state legislator to prominent voting rights activist and a contender in 2020 to become Joe Biden's running mate.",
    "The Republican National Committee released a statement predicting that Georgians will reject Stacey Abrams and her hypocritical mandates.?\nAbrams allies warn the attacks are loaded with racism and sexism, since she is vying to be Georgia's first Black governor and the first Black woman governor in U.S. history.",
    "Unmask our kids.?\nKemp, who had long allowed local districts to make decisions on classroom mask rules, hit back by suggesting he might now use the power of his office to try and end classroom mask mandates  further escalating the reaction to the Abrams picture.",
    "The rivals united this week in condemning Abrams, the leading Democrat running for governor, for hypocrisy after a photo surfaced of her posing maskless with students at an Atlanta-area elementary school she visited to mark Black History Month.",
    "It was updated on February 10, 2022, to correct attribution of the quote Georgians will reject Stacey Abrams and her hypocritical mandates.? The statement was from the Republican National Committee, not the Republican Governors Association.",
    "In trying to move past the controversy, her campaign has said she wore a mask to the school and only removed it to be better heard by students watching remotely  and for pictures on the condition that everyone around her kept theirs on.",
    "Perdue even turned Jones' departure from the race into an attack on the race's top Democrat, tweeting that Conservatives are united and ready to beat Stacey Abrams.?\nBut the shared antagonism may not be enough to heal GOP divisions.",
    "A small handful of school boards continue to ignore the science and impose mask mandates on our children while leading Democrats refuse to follow the mandates when visiting those same schools,? the governor tweeted.",
    "Perdue counters that some Republicans are still mad at Kemp for not doing enough to overturn Georgia's 2020 election result  which the former senator says proves only he can garner enough support to outpace Abrams.",
    "'?\nThe attacks cast Abrams as a Republican foil not unlike Hillary Clinton or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, where antagonism for someone in the other party helps the GOP base overlook fissures within its own ranks.",
    "She's female, she's Black, and of course everybody ducks it, but that's a huge part of it,? said Democratic state Rep. Al Williams, who serves on the board of the Abrams-founded Fair Fight voting rights group.",
    "Both Kemp and Perdue have long targeted Abrams for their own purposes, with Kemp arguing that Republicans need to unify behind him to fend off the Abrams threat since he narrowly bested her four years ago.",
    "Perdue released a campaign ad this week featuring the photo of an unmasked Abrams and declaring, This is the Georgia Stacey Abrams wants? but also adding, This is the reality Brian Kemp has allowed.",
    "Trump is backing Perdue, a former Senator who lost his reelection bid last year, because Kemp refused entreaties to thwart Biden's Georgia victory, which was affirmed by three recounts.",

    "He has escalated his involvement in recent weeks, helping convince another Republican running for governor, Vernon Jones, to drop his campaign to clear the field for Perdue.",
    "David Perdue and Brian Kemp need to find contrast with each other,? said Chip Lake, a Georgia Republican consultant who isn't working for Kemp or Perdue.",
    "Perdue declared, I'm running for governor to make sure Stacey Abrams is never governor,? at the very beginning of his announcement video in December.",
    "Kemp allies founded a group called Stop Stacey in January 2021  more than 10 months before Abrams announced she was running for governor again.",
    "But it's a sign that both men view opposition to Abrams as an animating issue for the Republican base heading into Georgia's May 24 primary.",
