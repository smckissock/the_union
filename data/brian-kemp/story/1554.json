    "Stefanowski, who has pledged to use $10 million of his own money, sticks to his biography in his opening commercials, which tout him as a middle class-born candidate who know[s] what it's like to start with nothing.?\nWednesday, Jan 26, 2022  12:16:48 PM Pacific Standard Time  Jeff Singer\nMA-Gov: Businessman Chris Doughty announced Wednesday that he'd run for this open seat as a moderate Republican? and would put down $500,000 of his own money as seed capital.?

    "Rosen was elected in 2010 by narrowly beating a Republican DA, and San Jose Spotlight's Tran Nguyen writes that he's traditionally been a tough-on-crime prosecutor.? But Rosen, Nguyen says, has garnered criticism for his handling of white-collar crime and domestic abuse cases? and has opposed a bill that bars the prosecution of 14- and 15-year-olds as adults.? The district attorney, though, moved to the left in 2020 when he announced that he'd no longer seek the death penalty and would institute other reforms, including the creation of a team to investigate criminal misconduct of police officers including excessive use of force.?\nHowever, his two opponents are far from satisfied.",
    "Wednesday, Jan 26, 2022  12:24:35 PM Pacific Standard Time  Jeff Singer\nSanta Clara County, CA District Attorney: Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen, whose jurisdiction includes San Jose and other Silicon Valley communities, has won re-election twice without any opposition, but the Democratic incumbent now faces a potentially serious challenge in the form of one of his former prosecutors, Daniel Chung, as well as public defender Sajid Khan.",
    "The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that unnamed Democratic \"[p]owerbrokers\" feared that a packed September nomination fight could give two-time Republican gubernatorial nominee and possible congressional candidate Allan Fung an opening in what's currently a 56-43 Biden seat, but that they hoped they could clear the House field by convincing one of McKee's three serious primary foes to run to succeed Langevin.",
    "Chung also said of Khan, He has only been a public defender, and his job has been to poke holes in the prosecution's case.?\nRosen has the support of much of the county's local Democratic establishment, including San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, while the San Jose Mercury News' Robert Salonga adds that the incumbent has already raised the $500,000 maximum allowed for this race.",
    "Khan has been running against Rosen on a platform of criminal justice reform while Chung is a self-described moderate.? Khan launched his campaign in July arguing he'd be a true, real progressive DA? who would aggressively prosecute police officers accused of misconduct; he also accused Rosen of dropping charges against cops who'd allegedly made racist and sexist posts on social media.",
    "Kelly now says she's considering what to do in the face of these unfavorable circumstances, though the other two constituencies that now contain parts of Nashville are even more conservative: The new 7th, where GOP Rep. Mark Green will almost certainly run, would have favored Trump 56-41, while Republican Rep. John Rose's 6th is considerably worse at 64-34 Trump.",
    "Chung claimed he was subsequently demoted because, while his piece didn't mention the Santa Clara County DA, my balanced approach to criminal justice reforms impeded his political aspirations,? and he soon sued Rosen for retaliation; Chung has also claimed that he was fired after he turned down a severance package he says was aimed at getting him to resign.",

    "While Doughty focused his opening pitch on jobs and the economy,? he told the Boston Globe he's usually opposed to allowing abortion after a fetus can feel pain.? And while Doughty volunteered that he voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016, he acknowledged that he supported his party's nominee four years later.",
    "Before Doughty can focus on winning the September primary, though, he needs to make sure he makes it past the May 21 party convention; that's because, as we've written before, major party candidates for statewide office need to win the support of at least 15% of the delegates to advance to the ballot.",
    "Salonga, meanwhile, writes that Chung declined to provide information about the status of his campaign? and has done minimal campaigning.?\nKhan recently released a mid-December poll from the Democratic firm SEA Polling & Strategic Design arguing that, with over 60% undecided, Rosen is very beatable.",

    "The final map makes the state's lone competitive seat, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace's 1st District, several points redder: Under the old lines, it voted for Donald Trump by a 52-46 margin, but the new iteration would have given Trump a 54-45 win, according to Dave's Redistricting App.",

    "By splitting Nashville, the GOP legislature has all but guaranteed that the city will be represented in the House by a Republican for the first time since 1875, when one-term Rep. Horace Harrison left office following his defeat the previous year.",
    "That's a considerably smaller lead for Kemp than the 41-22 edge he enjoyed last month in Insider Advantage's survey for Fox 5 Atlanta, though Quinnipiac puts him slightly closer to winning the majority of the vote he'd need to avert a June runoff.",
    "Rosen responded by filing a whistleblower complaint, arguing that Khan's writings, which included a map of the DA's office and other law enforcement complexes, amounted to threats of violence and destruction,? but he ended up withdrawing it.",

    "Doughty's supporters believe that he'd be a far more appealing nominee than Diehl in a state that has long sent moderate-sounding Republicans to the governor's office, but the new candidate also has some views that Democrats can attack.",
    "Wednesday, Jan 26, 2022  11:55:36 AM Pacific Standard Time  Jeff Singer\nCT-Gov: Wealthy businessman Bob Stefanowski, who was the 2018 Republican nominee, is spending $1 million on an opening TV buy for his second campaign for governor.",
