    "Willis was voted into office the same day Trump was voted out in 2020, and was inaugurated just one day before the phone call that is central to her investigation.",
    "\"If the attempt was to falsely claim that Donald Trump won Georgia, but in fact he did not, then part of the overarching case is to show he did not,\" Redmon said.",
    "\"So I imagine that remains her method, gathering all of the evidence, analyzing all of the evidence and deciding what, if any charges are appropriate.\"",

    "So it's a case of first impression in many respects,\" Rucker said.",
    "Contact Graham at KatesG@cbsnews.com or grahamkates@protonmail.com",
    "Willis is \"meticulous\" in her investigative work, said Redmon.",
    "She's always been a bulldog, from the first day I met her.",
    "\"So in my view, from the very beginning, all bets are off.",
