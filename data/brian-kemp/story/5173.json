    "At the bill-signing ceremony, Kemp claimed the new law makes sure that law-abiding Georgians, including our daughters and your family too, can protect themselves without having to have permission from your state government.?\nHe claimed owning a gun without a permit is a constitutional authority that people have, and they certainly shouldnt have a piece of paper from the government to be able to legally carry a weapon.?\nIts a shame the governors perception of constitutionally protected behavior is so narrow.",
    "Make no mistake: In Georgia, where several communities have seen spikes in gun ownership, gun theft and gun violence throughout the pandemic, Kemps view is out of line with most residents and even many law enforcement officials.",
    "Just hours after a mass shooting in New York on Tuesday reignited discussions about curbing gun proliferation, Kemp signed Senate Bill 319, which makes it legal for most Georgians to carry and conceal handguns without a license.",
    "He has gleefully signed bills that curtail the right to vote and the right to receive an abortion in Georgia, but he clearly feels the right to own a killing machine should be virtually unencumbered.",
    "An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll conducted earlier this year found nearly 70 percent of Georgia voters who responded opposed letting people own guns without obtaining a license first.",
    "That fits a national trend: Police, who often have to encounter individuals with guns, are outspoken about the dangers laws that promote gun proliferation pose to officers.",
    "But its clear the law he just enacted will make their lives more dangerous  and thats sure to be the case for the rest of Georgia, as well.",
    "Brian Kemp, a Republican, couldnt have chosen a worse time to sign into law a bill that weakens gun safety measures in his state.",
    "That includes roughly 54 percent of Republicans and about 60 percent of self-described conservatives.",
    "The party is obviously more wedded to the gun industry than it is to law enforcement.",
    "Several law enforcement figures in Georgia have spoken against the bill Kemp signed.",
    "That, in part, is what exposes the GOPs stand with police? rhetoric as a farce.",
    "Kemp himself has touted his self-proclaimed support? for police in the past.",
    "What a morbid vision of what the Constitution is meant to do.",
    "Georgia Gov."
