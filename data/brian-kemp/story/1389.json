    "If 20-year career politician Brian Kemp spent half as much time protecting Georgia's elections as he does scheming to hold on to his office, we wouldn't be in this mess.?\nIn a statement, Kemp's campaign spokesman, Cody Hall, said: It's no surprise that David Perdue and Stacey Abrams are joining forces to maintain the blatantly unfair status quo and continue raising money for their campaigns when the Governor is prohibited by law from doing so, solely because he is the incumbent during a legislative session.",
    "In a letter to supporters over the weekend, Abrams noted her fundraising advantage during December and January and said Kemp fears both our grassroots team and his GOP primary challenger, which is why he and his lieutenants in the legislature developed a cynical ploy to temporarily stop us both from raising funds.? Abrams urged her supporters to donate to her campaign as soon as possible? in the event the measure passes.",

    "The legislation also came after a federal judge's ruling  in a suit brought by Perdue  limited Kemp's ability to use money from a special campaign committee approved by the legislature last year that allowed the governor and House and Senate caucuses to raise unlimited donations.",
    "If it was passed in the legislature, the Governor would have to sign it to have the force of law, but we don't comment on pending legislation until the language is final.?\nGeorgia's gubernatorial race will be one of the most-watched in the nation.",
    "The intent of the original law was to avoid the appearance that lawmakers were trading votes for campaign dollars during the sessions, which tend to attract lobbyists and others pushing legislation and funding for their favorite projects.",
