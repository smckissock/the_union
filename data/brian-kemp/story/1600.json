    "I firmly believe that when government takes in more than it needs, it's our responsibility to the taxpayers to return those funds to them, because it's their money, not the government's,? Kemp said And these funds will do more good in the pockets of our citizens than in the coffers of our state, especially when we're dealing with an inflation rate that's at a 39-year high.?\nKemp's administration would hold back more than $700 million in the remaining surplus from last year.",
    "They spend a fair bit on Christmas this year, but they still have an awful lot left, and that is going to support our economy going forward.?\nDorfman said there's very little chance of a recession in the next year, although he predicted the growth of the economy and state tax revenues would slow as savings are spent down before resuming a more normal growth rate next year.",
    "Brian Kemp is pitching his plan to lawmakers to spend almost $3 billion more in the coming budget year, telling them we've got a lot of good things to talk about this year.?\nThat list includes income tax rebates, pay raises for teachers, university employees and state employees, more funding for K-12 and higher education.",

    "State economist Jeffrey Dorfman forecasts the state can afford the spending because tax revenue is expected to continue growing after a potential flat patch later this year.",

    "We're continuing to see returns on that decision to cut where we were able and to invest more wisely,? Kemp said.",
    "The budget proposes a $2,000 raise for teachers, which would complete Kemp's pledge to raise their pay by $5,000.",
