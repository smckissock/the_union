    "So that even in a Republican leaning year like people believe 2022 to be, they can overcome that and still win the races, particularly if, like you say, these Trump endorsed candidates who are not trying to appeal to the median voters in these win their primaries, and then it really becomes easy for whoever the Democratic nominee is to bash them over the head with that.",
    "The front runner Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, she had a few bad months where there was a lawsuit from a former black state Senate staffer who said that when Katie Hobbs was in charge of the state Senate Democrats, she participated in a conversation to have the staffer fired for what the staffer believes is racial reasons.",
    "David Nir:\nSo Republicans targeted McBath, and they pushed her into another district against another Democrat in the hopes of winning Georgia's 6th by making it a district Trump won by about 10 points or so, except the Atlanta suburbs as a whole spreading further and further from the city keep trending to the left.",
    "But let's drill down a little bit from that bigger picture, do you think that there are any seats, especially in districts that have been redrawn where states have completed the redistricting process that are bellwethers, that we might look at not necessarily just for 2022, but also for trends for the future?",
    "I've seen a lot of this in recent weeks, as in some states, Democrats have gerrymandered more aggressively, or things have unexpectedly not been as bad as feared, has been this Republican freak out over, how dare Democrats draw a gerrymandered map or get a fair map, thanks to a court ruling.",
    "There are governors galore up this year, and they matter quite a bit, especially after January 6th, when Republicans are talking about using governors to try to sign more voter suppression laws, or even worse, the stakes, it's not an exaggeration to say the stakes have never been higher.",
    "Again, some really close swing states with even larger pools of electoral votes and Republican state legislators who have been talking about passing laws that would allow them to subvert the results, like you said, to make sure Trump wins, regardless of whether he wins the most votes.",
    "And I think one thing that I think you'll listeners you'll see as you come along is that Nir will provide a voice of reason, if you will, to keep our eyes on the bluer states in what's probably going to be a bad year to make sure that we're not you overly optimistic.",
    "David Nir:\nSo do you guys remember a couple months back when the worst person you know, truly the worst person you know actually made a good point and that was Marjorie Taylor Greene when she complained about what Georgia Republicans had done in redistricting.",
    "Baker has been very hard for Democrats to beat in large part because Massachusetts does have a tradition of electing Republican governors who manage to sound moderate in order to counterbalance the democratic dominance of every other thing in Massachusetts.",
    "So why don't you talk about maybe not all of them, there probably are too many for this episode, we'll have you back, but maybe talk about the biggest ones and also with an eye toward how a Republican control might actually affect the electoral college?",
    "Of course, as we have said repeatedly, it's a difficult midterm environment but Marco Rubio is such a loathsome creature and in 2016 you may recall he didn't actually want to run for reelection to the Senate after his disastrous presidential campaign.",
    "Beard:\nYes, it is the Ned Lamont that you're thinking of that ran in a democratic primary against Joe Lieberman in 2006, beat him in the primary, only to lose to Joe Lieberman's decision to run as an independent and split the vote three ways in 2006.",
    "So can you maybe walk us through a little bit about what's changed there and what hope that might-\nwhat's changed there and sort of what hope that might offer for Democrats, whether in November, or at least in the coming years of this decade.",
    "If he's not there to veto them, then we'll just see how difficult Republicans can make voting, and who knows what else they can put in place to try to make sure that whoever gets the most votes in Wisconsin, Trump gets those electoral votes.",
    "David Nir:\nSinger, let's start with the Senate, which of course, as you mentioned, is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, Kamala Harris breaking ties in favor of Democrats when they're able to get things to a floor vote.",
    "But fortunately democrats got good news, Hogan said that he is not going to run and in fact I think he knew exactly what Democrats were thinking because he said he called Van Hollen up and told him you can sleep easy tonight.",
    "But I would say the most important thing I've learned watching elections over all these years is that even candidates who look weak long time away from the election, if they get the nomination, they have a good chance to win.",
    "And this time, Democrats have a very crowded primary, very hard to see a front runner at this point, and on the Republican side, this is another state where Donald Trump is mucking around in a place he's really not welcome.",
    "John James, who just ran for Senate in 2018 and 2020 losing narrowly, but I think generally impressing Republicans for how he ran his race and his results, has jumped into this race, even though he's not from the district.",
    "All you need to know about the 2022 midterms: What races to watch, with Jeff Singer\nThe Downballot\nFollowShare\n0:0047:24\n15301xFeb 10, 2022\n image/svg+xml\nPowered by Libsyn\nPowered by Libsyn\nBeard:\nHello, and welcome.",
    "You know, usually I'm something of a pessimist, at least I try to be that's what's in my blood but I will briefly mention another race instead that I'm looking at that is on the more optimistic side of the ledger.",
    "She was complaining that Republicans were setting themselves up for failure in the Atlanta suburbs by drawing a district that she thought would actually become vulnerable for the GOP a little bit down the line.",
    "Beard:\nNow it is certainly like you've given yourself a really tough challenge by running in what's probably going to be a Republican leaning year, in a Republican leaning state, but he's a good candidate.",
    "As a result, for whatever reason, he made the jump in a tough year, but he's got those same sort of union, working class roots that Sherrod Brown comes out of, and has been able to succeed in the state.",
    "The state Senate, which has been in Republican control since 1984, that one's a bit of a tough nut to crack, especially since the entire Senate, it's up in midterm years, not from presidential years.",
    "Not just the congressional maps, but the legislative maps in both of those states have been badly gerrymandered for decades, and that's finally changed, or are finally about to change, I should say.",
    "But as seasoned election watchers, we all know that some races have the chance to pop up on the radar that maybe we weren't expecting, or we're just keeping a glance on out of the corner of our eye.",
    "In Texas, for example, Republicans did what they could to take a bunch of seats that had become competitive, that they managed to hold in 2018 and 2020 and locked them up so that they're safely red.",
    "A dark blue state the Democrats usually can take for granted but Republicans had made a major push to try to recruit their term limited Governor Larry Hogan to run against Democrat Chis Van Hollen.",
    "I emphasize sound moderate because the person who is the front runner for the Republican nomination, Former State Representative Jeff Dial, he is not someone who sounds moderate in the least bit.",
    "Every week, David Nir and contributing editor David Beard will highlight some of the key stories in the world of downballot electionsespecially those that don't always generate the big headlines.",
    "Some states only have a couple, but a couple of the most important ones, particularly in light of, again, January 6th, are the Secretary of State races, when they run elections and the generals.",
    "The reason is Georgia, it just voted for a Democrat for the first time for statewide office, when Joe Biden won the state and Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff won the Senate races the next year.",
    "Trump just did a direct to camera ad for Perdue, where he just trashed Kemp and he trashed the almost certain Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams, who lost a very flawed election to Kemp in 2018.",
    "Democrats have a very strong recruit there in congresswoman Val Demings who is a former chief of police in the Orlando area and has really seen her star rise during her tenure in Congress.",
    "And one of the things about House races is that they tend to develop later, particularly in a redistricting year where these Senate races have been top of mind since those Georgia runoffs.",
    "But what sort of the broad takeaway from how this redistricting cycle is going to adjust the map and change sort of how a bunch of these races are going to be going in 2022 versus 2020?",
    "And as those get resolved, and as we get close to the election, we'll be able to better understand what specifically... What's the list of races that people are going to be focused on.",
    "Beard:\nOutside of those races that Jeff gave us a rundown on, the one that I'm keeping a hopeful eye out on, I'll say, is the Ohio Senate race, where we have a really good candidate.",
    "And it's also something to remember that happened in relatively recent history, in 2012 Democratic House candidates nationwide won more votes than Republican candidates nationwide.",
    "So she does have experience winning statewide, but I think we'll turn now toward the other end of things and look at Republican pickup opportunities because we have to face facts.",
    "David Nir:\nSo continuing the theme with those two states, there are, of course, also going to be state legislative elections for thousands of legislative seats across the country.",
    "Unlike Michigan, where all the seats are up in midterm years and never in presidential years, half the Pennsylvania senate's up in presidential years, half is up in midterm years.",
    "Beard:\nAnd the Dunleavy race is also interesting because it had one of the more embarrassing turns of fealty to Donald Trump in a long, long list by Republican-elected officials.",
    "So who knows if his heart is really in it and if somehow some way things should turn around for Democrats then maybe Republicans have to sweat Florida so keep an eye on that one.",
    "There's every possibility that he just runs away with it and it's not even on the map by November, but it's also possible that it could be a really interesting competitive race.",
    "Jeff has been part of the team at DKE for many, many years, and no one knows more, I mean, no one knows more about every single down ballot race taking place every single year.",
    "We've talked about some about top ones, but again, just like we did for Senate in house, we want to each highlight a race that we want to keep an eye on, as the cycle develops.",
    "So it's a very messy Republican Senate primary that could really bring out a damaged nominee, which would help, you know, for Ryan, it really needs to go perfectly for him.",
    "Singer:\nAnd primaries can always go ways you don't expect, but it would be a surprise if Laxalt isn't the nominee against the Democratic incumbent, Catherine Cortez Masto.",
    "David Nir:\nAnd you mentioned, Jeff, that 2018 race for Secretary of State, that was a big one when Katie Hobbs picked up that seat from Republicans in a very narrow race.",
    "But then again, the last time Massachusetts Republicans had a competitive statewide primary for an office, they actually had a chance to win, it's been a very long time.",
    "Van Hollen is going to get to sleep easy fortunately for the rest of the year though I'm sure he'll still be fundraising and campaigning like any good Senator does.",
    "And they're not going to just sit around being good government liberals who are like, \"Blue state should have fair maps and red states should have Republican maps.\"",
    "She knows the state well, but in a tough year, she can definitely have problems, even against someone like Laxalt, who's embraced the big lie and who lost in 2018.",
    "Beard:\nSort of in the opposite direction from the seat that the Nir observed, as various cultural influences have hurt Democrats among white working class voters.",
    "As Daily Kos Political Director David Nir announced this morning, Daily Kos is extremely excited to announce the launch of our brand-new podcast, The Downballot!",
    "For those of you not familiar with Macomb County, it's sort of the classic home of the Reagan Democrats that turned away from Carter and to Reagan in the '80s.",
    "JD Vance has got this notoriety for writing his book, and then sort of dived as far right as you could possibly go so people didn't think he was a DC person.",
    "We'll also bring on a guest to lead us into a deep dive around a major topic that will make you, our listeners, the best-informed political consumers around.",
    "And we'll probably talk little bit about redistricting, legislative races, and get even a little further into the weeds because the weeds are where we live.",
    "David Nir:\nAnd by the way, right now, this is our plea to Congressman Andy Levin, please run in the 10th district instead of the 11th against Haley Stevens.",
    "It was the state that when you thought swing states, you thought Missouri, but it's gone very far to the right since then, since Obama nearly lost in 2008.",
    "She won a very decisive win in 2018, but Michigan's another state that the political winds, if they shift, they can shift very hard in the wrong direction.",
    "The Democratic incumbent who could have run there, Andy Levin, chose to run in the neighboring Michigan 11th district, which is more Oakland County based.",
    "Democrats have won it in every presidential cycle from 2004 onwards, but it's a state with of plenty of swing voters, more than probably any other state.",
    "But if Democrats have a solid year or two, they could see the first majority in both chambers of the Pennsylvania legislature in a very, very long time.",
    "Singer:\nThen there's New Hampshire, where Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan, she's the former governor, she won a very, very, very close race in 2016.",
    "Mark Kelly, he's another special election winner who won in 2020 for the remaining two years of a term, and now is up for a regular six year term.",
    "This is one where even if Republicans do everything wrong, they still have their opening, especially if the political climate is going their way.",
    "Beard:\nAnd I even tweeted about how I thought Levin had a decent shot at the 10th when the maps were finalized before he announced for the 11th.",
    "Hobbs has two serious opponents in the primary, Former State Representative Aaron Lieberman and Former Homeland Security Official Marco Lopez.",
    "Beard:\nSo that's the one I'm sort of keeping my fingers crossed about, to see if we can at least be competitive once we get later in the year.",
    "But in the lead up to 2018, there was a lot of talk about how Democrats could win millions more votes in House races and still lose the House.",
    "There was a serious recall against him that got derailed because of the pandemic, but this is the time voters have to finally have their say.",
    "Until Trump endorses someone that probably won't be for a while, but just like in Michigan, any Republican nominee has a real chance to win.",
    "Beard:\nThis is the one where Dunleavy had to promise to Donald Trump that he would not endorse the much hated Lisa Murkowski for reelection.",
    "Beard:\nAnd what I would say to of them is that, Democrats have tried very hard to pass non-partisan gerrymandering reform through Congress.",
    "This one could go on a long time, especially since Georgia requires candidates to win a majority in the primary in order to avoid a runoff.",
    "And that's why we've got a lot planned, to go really deep into a lot of these races, but we just wanted to start out with a broad overview.",
    "But like you said, Jeff, that is truly a terrible thing for democracy when the party that wins the most votes doesn't win the most seats.",
    "Hogan is quite popular he has managed to earn a lot of crossover votes in a state that typically votes Democratic up and down the ballot.",
    "If they get Greitens's though, or if whoever comes out of this is just so banged up, the show me state could give us something to watch.",
    "Trump's endorsed Former Senator David Perdue, who lost one of the 2020 runoffs to John Ossoff, and this is going to be a big bloody one.",
    "And since then, Republicans have put in place as many voter suppression laws as they can, and they already had quite a few on the books.",
    "And as long as they don't want to do that, they have to live with the fact that Democrats are going to play by the rules that they set.",
    "Let's look at a couple purple states that don't have that benefit where Democrats are going to try to pick up the gubernatorial races.",
    "Tim Ryan, who's been a Congressman for a long time for Northeast Ohio, he's been long talked about as a potential statewide candidate.",
    "Beard:\nThere's no one better to help us run down this huge year for down ballot races than Daily Kos Elections editor, Jeff Singer.",
    "Beard:\nAnd one of the benefits that Democrats have in Maryland and Massachusetts is that there's a heavy Democratic baseline vote.",
    "Singer:\nPennsylvania, like Michigan, is a state where Republicans have controlled the legislature almost continuously for decades.",
    "The race that I'm going to pick is one that sort of pairs with my Ohio Senate choice from earlier, it's Michigan's 10th district.",
    "So I want to chat with you guys and find out what are you keeping an eye on that might not be in the top tier target list, Beard?",
    "He's endorsed former TV journalist Kari Lake, who has adopted, even by Trump's standards, some very strange conspiracy theories.",
    "And maybe also give us your thoughts on which of those Democratic incumbents you think might be the most vulnerable in November.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "Republicans have a big majority of the Senate, so this could be a two cycle process, and especially if 2022 has some setbacks.",
    "And that even included in 2018 when Democrat, Ned Lamont, won by just two or three points against Republican, Bob Stefanowski.",
    "What we're going to do today is a preview of the key races at several different levels that we're all looking at for November.",
    "I'm David Beard, contributing editor for Daily Kos Elections, here with my co-host, Daily Kos' political director, David Nir.",
    "In our second episode, we are joined by Daily Kos Elections editor Jeff Singer, whose knowledge of elections is unparalleled.",
    "Singer:\nHe's endorsed a delegate, Dan Cox, who has been... Well he's about as bad as you think for someone endorsed by Trump.",
    "And I think most people would agree that those two are in Massachusetts and a state we mentioned a little earlier, Maryland.",
    "Now, I don't think Democrats are going to win Georgia's 6th this November, but I will be really curious to see the margins.",
    "Democrats swept the Attorney General and Secretary of state races in 2018, both democratic incumbents are on the defensive.",
    "We are primarily accountable to readers like you because donations from readers like you are our biggest source of income.",
    "Lake hasn't raised much money, but if Trump's loud enough and the primary's crowded enough, she can be the nominee easily.",
    "So even a candidate who isn't super well known can definitely have a good shot if the political climate's going their way.",
    "Joe Biden's victory was the first time any Democratic presidential candidate had won the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.",
    "Singer:\nFor the play in Georgia, the Republican candidate who's gotten the most attention by far has been Herschel Walker.",
    "Midterms are always the big year for gubernatorial races, which is a word I'm going to avoid for the rest of the podcast.",
    "And in November, there's a rank choice ballot, never seen something like this before in America, if not the entire world.",
    "Janet Mills who won in 2018, replaced Paul LePage, who was term limited out after a very controversial tenure, let's say.",
    "This time in Michigan though, because of a 20 ballot measure, an independent redistricting commission drew up the lines.",
    "But in a Republican lean year, it's very possible that you could see him swept in the way that he was in 2010 and 2014.",
    "They have a... And they had an independent process for the first time ever after the previous maps were gerrymandered.",
    "And that's one way that you could see all of the other positives building on each other, if he has a damaged opponent.",
    "And we also have plenty of other races for state legislatures, for district attorneys across the country, for mayors.",
    "David Nir:\nThings are going well, and I'm excited for today's guest, who is Daily Kos Elections' editor, Jeff Singer.",
    "Except for after the 2006 and 2008 elections, Democrats had no control over either house of the Michigan legislature.",
    "Democrats swept the court elections in 2015, one of the most consequential town ballot victories in a very long time.",
    "So Jeff, do you have just one or two of those races that we really want to keep an eye on, looking towards the fall?",
    "And once he made his promise not to endorse her, because Trump doesn't like her, he was able to get the endorsement.",
    "But this is another one where Republicans have a truly packed primary, and they have some pretty strange candidates.",
    "They've gotten some candidates who aren't super well known at this point, but New Hampshire's a very volatile state.",
    "And Poliquin actually got a plurality vote in the first round, but you don't win with a plurality under rank choice.",
    "Singer:\nI'll start with Georgia because when you say messy Republican primary, this is sort of the epicenter of it.",
    "Jeff Singer, editor at Daily Kos Elections and absolute mastermind when it comes to knowledge of down-ballot races.",
    "Beard:\nBut that's one of, again, many, many governor's races that we're going to be covering throughout the cycle.",
    "Someone who doesn't look like a particularly good candidate, if they get the nomination, they can have an opening.",
    "Neither of them has anything like her name recognition or resources, but we'll just have to see how this one goes.",
    "She'd still have a hard time winning general election in Maryland, but she's more the type of Republican who can.",
    "Singer:\nThere are some big variations by state, but a lot of what we've been seeing is locking in the status quo.",
    "And Michigan's another state where if things are bad for Democrats, anyone has an opening on the Republican side.",
    "I know we've gone through a lot of races, but we just want to touch a little bit on some other down-ballot races.",
    "Pennsylvania redistricting, it's done by commission, but the tiebreaker is appointed by the state Supreme Court.",
    "That's because Kevin Nicholson, he's a Marine and a businessman who lost a really expensive 2018 Senate primary.",
    "Arizona and Georgia, which are also the center of the Senate universe, also have competitive races for governor.",
    "Very white working class, pretty heavily union compared to most of the rest of the country, heavy UAW presence.",
    "Maine is a blue state, not a super blue state, but tends to vote more democratic than Republican, on the whole.",
    "And Republican justices and Republican members of Congress have repeatedly and nearly unanimously stopped that.",
    "Singer:\nFrom the '90s onward, every decade, the Republicans had complete controlled their districting process.",
    "That was handled by a redistricting commission made up of two Democrats, two Republicans, and one independent.",
    "We came in with Biden carrying five seats and Democrats holding five seats to the Republican and Trump's four.",
    "So I think if anyone can win a Senate race other than Sherrod Brown for the Democrats, it's probably Tim Ryan.",
    "And the big question as we're recording is whether Governor Doug Ducey enters the Republican primary as well.",
    "They are some Republicans running to Dunleavy's right, which is hard to imagine, but that's where we are now.",
    "But we found he helped Democrats in Minnesota in 2002 and voted in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary.",
    "And in terms of what a Republican governor could do for Trump's or whoever's prospects in 2024, quite a bit.",
    "So there are four key seats where the Democrats are on defense, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and New Hampshire.",
    "But he recognized Joe Biden won Georgia and the election 2020, so there he goes as far as Trump's concerned.",
    "And his likely Republican opponent is someone he's very familiar with, former Congressman, Bruce Poliquin.",
    "That's what we were following the Ossoff race to see if the trends actually keep moving to the left here.",
    "He would have been a real potential threat I don't know if he could have won, Maryland is just that blue.",
    "So if Democrats want it, they really need to take it this year, or almost certainly just wait until 2026.",
    "And we know we will be having you back on soon to revisit some of these and discuss some fresh ones soon.",
    "Pennsylvania is a similar story, except there's no Democratic incumbent because Tom Wolf has termed out.",
    "And a big part of that is, Alaska is going to do an election that has never been seen before in America.",
    "They tried to get it enacted through the Supreme court, ruling that gerrymandering was unconstitutional.",
    "If Republicans nominate what passes for a normal Republican candidate these days, they're probably fine.",
    "The previous seat took the district into more Democratic areas so that it kept it relatively Democratic.",
    "And I feel like I really understand the state of play in all of the most competitive races in November.",
    "But Arizona Democrats have done a bit better in statewide races over the last few decades than Georgia.",
    "Things like Attorney General, Secretary of State, Labor Commissioner, Secretary of Education sometimes.",
    "This of course, is yet another traditionally, typically blue state on the federal level in particular.",
    "Democrats won narrow majorities in the state house in 2006, 2008, lost in the Republican wave in 2010.",
    "And Jeff, you mentioned at the top of the program, that there are ton of races for governor this year.",
    "Maryland, it's a state where unlike Massachusetts, Democrats have usually controlled the governorship.",
    "The Democrats have a primary of their own, but the front runner is the Attorney General Maura Healey.",
    "Like Ron Johnson, she just seems to be testing just how bad can you be and still win the swing state?",
    "We have a while to go before May, but it would take a lot for Herschel Walker to lose the nomination.",
    "Singer:\nIt's a map that, in a reasonable year, Democrats could win either the house and state Senate.",
    "And I don't like gerrymandering, but I am glad to see that Democrats are not being wimps this cycle.",
    "And I think that this is one... Don't sleep on it because like I said, these races have been close.",
    "The Democratic nominee, almost without question, is going to be the Attorney General, Josh Shapiro.",
    "My home state of North Carolina, even though they do this on presidential years, it's a huge slate.",
    "Beard:\nA lot of states are going to be electing other statewide offices beyond the governor's race.",
    "Singer\nI would say the race that we should be paying attention to that maybe we're not is Missouri.",
    "Everyone knew what the 2022 Senate outlook was going to be and what the top races were going to be.",
    "Sometimes hard to remember that because we did win the House under the current maps in 2018, 2020.",
    "There's a few well-funded people, including Karrin Taylor Robson, she's a Board of Regents member.",
    "Hobbs has apologized, but plenty of people haven't accepted the apology and it's been dogging her.",
    "He lost by about four percentage points in a really close race against now governor Steve Sisolak.",
    "Singer:\nFor Nevada, Democrats have nearly won quite a few statewide races in the last few cycles.",
    "So this, potentially on both sides, hopefully more on the Republican side, could be a big factor.",
    "He's hinted that he'll spend to try to keep that from happening, but it's a very packed primary.",
    "Steve Gaynor, who lost to none other than Katie Hobbs for the 2018 race for Secretary of State.",
    "Larry Hogan hasn't endorsed her, but there isn't really much of a question she's his candidate.",
    "So if he runs he's in for a world of pain in the primary, but he'd be the best known candidate.",
    "So why don't you start off by giving us sort of a bird's eye view of what's at stake this year?",
    "And even if Schultz pulls it off, this is one where Democrats have a good shot no matter what.",
    "He has some primary opposition, but it'll probably be hard to beat him in a primary with that.",
    "We'll have a deeper dive on specifically redistricting later on as we get throughout the year.",
    "The Republican primary is just a demolition derby of all sorts of candidates, no front runner.",
    "Everyone runs on the same ballot in August and before candidates with the most votes, before.",
    "Stacey Abrams, she has no serious opponents, say she's waiting for whoever emerges from this.",
    "He'd be a big name, but there are a lot of problems with him, namely, Donald Trump hates him.",
