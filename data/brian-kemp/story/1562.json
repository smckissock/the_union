    "As lawmakers debate how to Trump proof? our elections against a rerun of 2020, a difficult question has emerged as pivotal to these efforts: What strategy might be most likely to succeed in subverting a future presidential election where Donald Trump's corrupt scheme failed?",
    "If a Democrat won the state by a slim margin, and the election came down to it, Perdue could send a rogue slate of electors based on a fake pretext of election fraud, and the GOP-controlled House could simply count those electors.",
    "Meanwhile, at the congressional end, reform must address the other possible scenario floated above: a corrupt House and Senate refusing to count the correct electors sent by a non-corrupt governor and legislature.",
    "Here's the unsettling reality: If the ECA isn't revised, under certain scenarios, all it would take for a future effort to succeed is a single corrupt GOP governor and a GOP-controlled House of Representatives.",
    "So Seligman suggests a second backstop: In an ECA reform bill, Congress could explicitly direct the Supreme Court to review Congress' count after the fact, making it less likely to decline to intervene.",
    "Right now, efforts in Congress to revise the ECA are focused mainly on the possibility of a rogue House and Senate refusing to count legitimate electors, as Trump attempted to pull off in 2020.",
    "At the state end, one emerging solution in the Senate would trigger heightened judicial review when a state government fails to follow preexisting procedures in appointing electors.",
    "But the paper suggests that at such a point, someone like Perdue  already far down the road of lawlessness  might ignore the court's command and send the fake electors anyway.",
    "Also note that in swing states such as Pennsylvania, GOP candidates for governor are campaigning explicitly on their willingness to side with Trump's lies about 2020.",
    "It will help shape Congress's efforts to shore them up via reform of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, or ECA, which governs how Congress counts presidential electors.",
    "Even if the scenario it outlines is extreme, it deserves attention, because it raises very vexing points about weaknesses in our election system.",
    "A new paper by an election law specialist seeks to answer this question with a realistic risk assessment? of the 2024 presidential election.",
    "This one would simply require Republicans to capture the House and for the right Trumpist Republican to win a key swing-state governorship.",
    "A Democratic Senate might object, but under the ECA, both chambers must object to a slate of electors to invalidate it, so it would stand.",
    "Their time would be more productively devoted to figuring out how to fix the system to avert such a meltdown, however unlikely it seems.",
    "Brian Kemp, who is under fire from Trump supporters precisely because he refused to overturn the 2020 results.",
    "Imagine that former senator David Perdue becomes Georgia governor, after winning a GOP primary against Gov.",
    "Here's the conclusion that emerges: Reform must thwart corruption at both the state and congressional ends.",
    "Some are currently vowing to turn a GOP House into a 24/7 circus of insurrectionist conspiracy-mongering.",
    "At that point the Supreme Court could decide this is a political question and decline to intervene.",
    "But note that Perdue has explicitly said he wouldn't have certified Joe Biden's electors in 2020.",
    "Ultimately, getting ECA reform right will require balancing efforts to address all these threats.",
    "Some pundits are having a grand old time mocking those who are thinking through such scenarios.",
    "The imperative is to take potential corruption of the certification of electors seriously.",
    "Similarly, well over 100 House Republicans already voted to invalidate Biden's electors.",
    "The GOP House could count them regardless of the court's command, the paper posits.",
    "Given that implicit promise, the pressure on him to carry it out would be immense.",
    "But as noted, a GOP governor could ignore this, and a GOP House could play along.",
    "Other reforms to the state certification process are also worth considering.",
    "Can anyone doubt the plausibility of a GOP House counting the fake electors?",
    "Considering the likelihood of each is central to getting ECA reform right.",
    "Would one execute such a scheme where GOP legislatures refused to before?",
    "It's to understand the weaknesses in the system in order to reform it.",
    "That means he's campaigning on an implicit openness to such a scheme.",
    "Imagine Speaker Kevin McCarthy controlling the House on Jan. 6, 2025.",
    "Understanding these weaknesses has concrete utility right now.",
    "Still, the point here is not to argue this scenario is likely.",
    "And it's obvious such glaring weaknesses are not tenable.",
    "And do you want to rely on someone like Florida GOP Gov.",
    "There are several routes for a future effort to succeed.",
    "We don't know, but it's certainly plausible.",
    "True, a lot would have to fall into place.",
    "This new paper offers another possibility.",
    "This is an extremely difficult problem.",
    "Ron DeSantis to do the right thing?",
    "Is this far-fetched?",
    "Game over."
