    "Bill White, who is leading the cityhood effort, countered on Breitbart News Saturday last weekend that Duncan is out to lunch? and that after close to two months in office, Dickens has not demonstrated that he adequately supports law enforcement, that crime is off to a worse start,? and that the Atlanta police force is understaffed.",
    "Geoff Duncan (R), the Senate president who has long opposed creating a Buckhead City, moved the Senate bill into a committee controlled by Democrats last month, however, and that seemingly dealt a fatal blow to the effort, at least for this year, because of Democrat opposition to the measure.",
    "Trump, in his quest to see Kemp unseated, is backing Kemp's leading primary opponent, former Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), in the race for Georgia governor this year, as well as backing state Sen. Burt Jones, a Republican running in the race for lieutenant governor against Miller.",
