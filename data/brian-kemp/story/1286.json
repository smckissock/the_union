    "Georgia's House speaker on Tuesday proposed a $1 billion tax cut that would create a flat state income tax with a 5.25% tax rate, raise the amount of income exempt from taxation and eliminate many deductions.",

    "Georgia's top income tax rate is now 5.75%, which applies to income over $7,000 earned by a single person or income over $10,000 earned by a married couple or a single person with dependents.",
    "Democrats, though, say Georgia's bright budget picture presents a once-in-a-generation chance to improve government services that will disappear if Republicans reduce revenue with a tax cut.",
    "A family of four for instance, will not pay one penny of income tax on their first $30,000,? Blackmon said, citing the $24,000 standard exemption plus $6,000 in dependent exemptions.",
    "The Republican plan would wipe out those lower brackets, setting up a single rate of 5.25% and eliminating a number of deductions for people who itemize their income taxes.",
    "Speaker David Ralston and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Shaw Blackmon, both Republicans, said the bill provides tax relief and simplifies Georgia's tax system.",
    "There's a lot of things that we could do to build the infrastructure for the development of people in Georgia.?\nFollow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy.",
    "The measure eliminates a separate standard deduction, which also allows a taxpayer to save money, rolling it up into the more valuable and higher standard exemption.",

    "Below that are a series of lower brackets created when typical incomes were much lower.",
    "Former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, the top Republican primary challenger to incumbent Gov.",
    "He said a family of four that makes $50,000 would save $500 overall from today.",
    "This plan lowers the rate and significantly raises the standard exemption.",
