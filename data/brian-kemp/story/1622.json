    "LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the Atlanta-based voting rights group Black Voters Matter Fund, calls the Georgia law a death by a thousand cuts? that has the potential to change the results of the election.? But the scariest part of the process,? she says, is what they're doing with the election boards.?\nThat's right: The newestand potentially most dangerousanti-democratic threat are new laws designed to give Trump-backed election deniers unprecedented control over how elections are run and how votes are counted.",
    "McBath's district is a striking case in point: Under a new redistricting map crafted by Georgia Republicans, her diverse suburban Atlanta seatwhere moderate white voters joined an influx of Black, Latino, and Asian American residents to elect herwould now stretch all the way to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, with Republicans adding three deeply red and predominantly white countiesForsyth, Dawson, and Cherokeewhere Donald Trump won 70 percent of the vote.",
    "Raffensperger, meanwhile, is being challenged by GOP Rep. Jody Hice, who voted to reject presidential electors from Pennsylvania and Arizona after the insurrection, signed on to a lawsuit by the state of Texas asking the Supreme Court to throw out election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and has said he was not convinced at all, not for one second, that Joe Biden won the state of Georgia.?\nHice is not an outlier.",
    "When it comes to protecting majority rule in America, the majority should rule in the United States Senate.? If Democrats do manage to persuade Manchin and Sinemapretty unlikelyto quickly approve approve new bills banning partisan gerrymandering and expanding voting access, such as the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, it will go a long way toward stopping GOP efforts to undermine democracy.",
    "Their endgame?? President Joe Biden asked rhetorically during a major speech in Atlanta on January 11. To turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestionsomething states can respect or ignore.? This isn't just about the normal ebb and flow of partisan politics; it's a test of whether a party that is deadly serious about ending American democracy as we know it will regain control of ostensibly democratic institutions.",
    "Back then, insurrectionist Democrats (then the party of white supremacy) used every means necessaryincluding violence and vote-riggingto retake control of the state and federal governments, while accommodationist Republicans (then the party of civil rights) appealed to bipartisan unity, touted economic legislation, and supported the filibuster to block voting rights legislation, leading to nearly a century of Jim Crow.",
    "While Republicans have made the hostile takeover of the country's election system their central organizing principle, the Biden administration prioritized economic legislation over voting rights, going so far as to list the passage of the infrastructure bill as the first item in a fact sheet touting the steps it had taken to restore and strengthen American democracy? ahead of a global democracy summit in December.",
    "Finally, in the past couple of weeks, Democrats have made a last-ditch push to protect voting rights, with Biden saying he supports exempting voting rights bills from the filibuster, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) pressing hard to change the Senate rules to overcome GOP obstruction, setting up a showdown on the filibuster by Martin Luther King Jr. Day.",
    "Though Democrats are faring slightly better in the redistricting process overall compared with the last decade, these extreme maps in GOP-controlled swing states, combined with Biden's sagging approval ratings, will likely help Republicans pick up enough seats to retake the US House in 2022 and lock in dominance of state legislatures for the next 10 years.",
    "After Raffensperger defended the integrity of the 2020 election, Republicans removed himand all his successorsas chair and voting member of the state election board, which oversees voting rules and election certification, and gave the GOP-controlled legislature the power to appoint the board's chair, allowing them to control a majority of the members.",
    "These policies are already having an impactduring local elections in November, the number of rejected absentee-ballot applications rose from less than 1 percent in 2020 to 4 percent, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a troubling indicator of how easy it would be to tilt the outcome in a state decided by just over 11,000 votes in 2020.",
    "Those changes include more than a dozen GOP-controlled states passing new provisions to interfere with impartial election administration, while Trump and his allies aggressively recruit Stop the Steal?inspired candidates to take over key election positions like secretary of state offices and local election boards in major battleground states.",

    "Sixty-five percent of House Republicans refused to certify the election results in 2020 just hours after the insurrection, and that caucus will become even more radical after 2022.\nThe people who don't want to certify free and fair elections,? predicts Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), will regain control of the federal government.",
    "Most key battleground states have already passed new redistricting maps that courts could be reluctant to alter in the thick of an election yearand, though many states quickly expanded voting options during the pandemic in 2020, it takes time to properly implement pro-voter policies like online and automatic registration.",

    "Republicans who falsely maintain that the election was stolen say they are extremely motivated to vote in 2022, with the Big Lie functioning as a new Lost Cause movement, similar to how embittered Southerners used the death of the Confederacy as a rallying cry to fuel the backlash to Reconstruction.",
    "Based on these challenges, local boards could then decline to certify election results or disqualify enough voters to swing a close electionexactly the gambit Trump tried to pull off in 2020.\nMore than just reducing turnout, they're stacking the deck to actually manipulate the results,? Brown says.",
    "This is how Trump's end goal for January 6 becomes far more likely in 2024: If Republicans take back the House through aggressive gerrymandering, they'll not only derail Biden's agenda, but they'll be much more inclined to reject the results of a contested presidential election if a Democrat wins.",
    "But even if she wins a messy primary against Bourdeaux, Democrats will have lost a House seat in 2022 in a state that is trending blue, and communities of color will have less political representationeven though they account for all of the state's population growth over the past decade.",
    "A similar outcome is being replicated in other key battlegrounds, like Ohio, North Carolina, and Texas, where Republican legislatures passed redistricting maps that will hand their party between 65 and 80 percent of US House seats in states where Biden narrowed the GOP's 2016 advantage.",
    "At the same time, the blockage of voting rights legislation is demoralizing the Democratic basewhich views democracy protection as a pressing priorityand threatening to depress turnout, making it easier for Republicans to prevail in the midterms and advance their assault on democracy.",

    "Kemp are now facing Trump-endorsed primary challengers, raising the prospect that Georgia's top executive and top election official heading into 2024 could be Big Lie champions predisposed to helping steal a future election for Trump or another Republican candidate.",
    "Only a few dozen votes were ultimately thrown out, but now Georgia's new law explicitly allows an unlimited number of voters to be challenged and requires local election boards to hear these challenges within 10 days or face sanctions from the state election board.",
    "Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) have insisted that any federal legislation stopping such measures requires a bipartisan supermajority, portraying the filibuster not as an impediment to protecting democracy, but as integral to its functioning.",
    "Today I'm making it clear: to protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed, to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights,? Biden said during his speech in Atlanta this week.",
