    "\"I don't think this is going to hurt Abrams that much, and I think, if people know this is coming from things like book deals, they're going to be thinking about this differently than, 'She's lining her pockets because she's on boards of corporations and things like that.'\"",
    "Marko Klasnja, a Georgetown University professor who has studied the causes and consequences of politicians' wealth, said that \"in the U.S., people don't care about wealth per se, and I don't think that they would think that's a negative, necessarily.\"",

    "The $975,000 property she bought just outside the Atlanta city limits near Emory University in 2020 is financed by a $760,000 mortgage, according to Abrams' financial disclosure.",
