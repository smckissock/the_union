    "Border Patrol operations that seize fentanyl from smugglers become evidence, as the Republican National Committee put it in February, that illicit drugs are flowing into the country at an alarming rate because of Biden's open border.?\nThe argument is twofold: That seizures are up because overall trafficking is up, and that the Biden administration is creating opportunities for traffickers every time there's a surge of migrants, who might not have come if Biden wasn't lifting restrictions.",
    "And now, right here in Alabama, millions of your tax dollars are paying for the first transgender public school in the South.?

    "John Fetterman (D) has focused on the same message since he first went on the air: his life story, and the start of his political career in Braddock, Pa.
