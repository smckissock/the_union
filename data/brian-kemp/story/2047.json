    "In George, incumbent governor Brian Kemp, whom Trump blames for his loss in 2020, has withstood Trump's attacks and leads handily in recent polls.",
    "Endorsing the frontrunner, McCormick, would not generate much news  but plumping for a national TV talk show host gets national publicity.",
    "All that said, it is amusing to watch the trail of supplicants make the pilgrimage to Mar-A-Lago to beg for the blessing of Trump.",
