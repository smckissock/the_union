    "\"We're a few days from some big primaries including in Georgia, where the former President Donald Trump has worked hard, really hard, to defeat incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp,\" said anchor John Berman.",
    "\"And just to be clear, David Perdue is the candidate that Donald Trump very publicly endorsed; Brian Kemp, the candidate Donald Trump very publicly wants to defeat,\" said Berman.",
    "Now you have this possibility not only in Georgia, where you see David Perdue going down, you have this possibility in Alabama where Trump's old candidate does well without him.",
    "On CNN Friday, elections analyst Harry Enten said that former President Donald Trump is likely to be \"embarrassed\" by the results out of Georgia in next week's primary.",
    "The election will pit an incumbent governor against a Trump-backed challenger  who is likely to crash and burn, and even Trump appears to be bracing for it.",
    "\"Mo Brooks, remember Donald Trump endorsed him originally and then withdrew that endorsement and it was because he didn't want to get behind a loser.",
    "In that two-month period, David Perdue has basically fallen to the ground... Brian Kemp, the very clear favorite ahead of that primary on Tuesday.\"",
    "I think Tuesday could be one of those more embarrassing days for Donald Trump.\"",
    "There may be some  the possibility of tough results for Trump there as well.\"",
    "\"So, look, this is a new Fox News poll that was released on Wednesday night.",
    "When he withdrew that endorsement in March, Brooks... was behind by ten.",
    "\"He's about to probably get embarrassed, John,\" said Enten.",
    "You need 50 percent of the vote plus one to avoid a runoff.",
    "\"There are other races on Tuesday you're watching also.",
    "\"Yeah, I mean, one of these is in Alabama,\" said Enten.",
    "Look what happened in that two-month period.",
    "Without Trump support, Brooks has gone up.",
    "He's at 32 points ahead of David Perdue.",
    "Look at where we were in March, folks.",
    "Watch the video below or at this link.",
    "\"So how is that going for him, Harry?\"",
    "And look at where Brian Kemp is.",
    "Brian Kemp was at 50 percent.",
    "David Perdue 11 points back.",
    "He's at 60 percent."
