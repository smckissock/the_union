    "Notably, Ivey's ad came after her primary opponent, former Trump ambassador to Slovenia, Lindy Blanchard, also ran an ad declaring, The election was stolen from Donald Trump, and now we're paying the price.? (Ivey had previously run an ad more obliquely assuring she had stood with Trump to ensure no election here could ever be stolen.?)\nAlso new this week  Lynda Blanchard's campaign to unseat fellow Republican Kay Ivey as Alabama governor is up with a TV spot across the state spreading 2020 falsehoods.",
    "pic.twitter.com/O3i3AqQbOS\nMoreno, a self-funder with plenty of money to burn on early campaign ads, ran one that declared, President Trump says the election was stolen, and he's right.? But the ad made no actual mention of fraud, instead citing supposed Big Tech censorship of major stories, such as about Hunter Biden.",
    "Kay Ivey (R) ran a new ad in her primary saying, The fake news, big tech and blue state liberals stole the election from President Trump.? She didn't point to specific supposed evidence of voter fraud  but she did say Alabama wouldn't allow extensive absentee voting or ballot drop boxes.",
    "But the need to toe Trump's line to have any real future in the party  combined with the passage of time, allowing for both memories of Jan. 6 and the need for rhetorical consistency to fade  has forced some truly astounding political contortions and fungible morals.",
    "Was it anywhere near enough to change the result, no.?\nMoreno ended his campaign a month and a half after the ad ran, citing his desire not to split the vote of those who support the former president, whose stolen election claims he had once rebuked.",
    "So they instead talked about irregularities? and states expanding mail-in balloting during the pandemic  things that nobody could pitch with a straight face as a stolen election?  and ignored the substance of Trump's argument (such as it existed).",
    "At their first debate, the two spent what the Atlanta Journal-Constitution clocked as 23 minutes arguing about Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him  including in Georgia, supposedly with Kemp's help.",
    "While seeking reelection in a January 2021 runoff, Perdue checked the necessary boxes to make sure Trump didn't pull the rug out from under his and fellow Sen. Kelly Loeffler's (R-Ga.) campaigns.",
    "If expanding the vote in general is treated as dishonest or illegal, as above, then you can simply wave your hand at any tool for making voting easier as something to be avoided at all costs.",
    "(Kemp has a healthy lead in a new poll released by AJC on Tuesday morning  53-27  which suggests Perdue needs to do what he can to knock Kemp below 50 percent, to get to a runoff.)",
    "He reportedly didn't respond to the Nevada Independent's follow-up question about whether he believed there was widespread fraud, as Trump has repeatedly said with no evidence.",
    "Although there's still no evidence of widespread fraud, Perdue is going further now than he did then  for the obvious reason that he needs to win a primary to win an election.",
    "While others went on Fox News and echoed Trump's claims, Perdue spoke mostly about supposed irregularities?  a fallback for many a Trump ally trying to toe the line.",
    "When he launched his 2022 campaign in September, he declined to say whether he thought the election was stolen and who was the legitimately elected president.",
    "Both signed a letter calling for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) to resign and said they would object to the election results on Jan. 6.",
    "Thorough searching reveals no instance of Ivey complaining of a stolen election between Election Day 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021  or even months afterward.",
    "Another prime example is Perdue's fellow former senator, Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who lost his Senate seat in 2018 and is now running for governor.",
    "After being booed at a gubernatorial debate in January, he said in early February that Biden was an illegitimate president.",
    "But asked what made him think that, Heller's campaign merely cited a poll that showed lots of Republicans also believed it.",
    "First off, let me be very clear tonight: The election in 2020 was rigged and stolen,? Perdue said this weekend.",
    "Brian Kemp (R) is all about, former senator David Perdue erased it with the first few words out of his mouth.",
    "\"The election was stolen from Donald Trump, and now we're paying the price,\" Blanchard says into the camera.",
    "What's more, Moreno shortly after the 2020 election had urged his party to drop claims of widespread fraud.",
    "This isn't simply the rigged? argument but instead sits in the middle between that and what Trump alleges.",
    "She spoke broadly in terms of every vote being counted and Trump's right to challenge the election.",
    "Was there probably *some* fraud, illegal votes, etc, yes,? Moreno said in a later-deleted tweet.",
    "Republicans knew that what Trump was saying was ridiculous and that they couldn't defend it.",
    "Repeatedly, high-profile statewide GOP candidates have run ads claiming a stolen election.",
    "And often, they'll avoid saying it was stolen for the reasons Trump himself cites.",
    "(Ivey's office hasn't responded to a request for comment on whether she did.)",
    "In case there was any doubt about what his primary challenge to Georgia Gov.",
    "Often, they made no such claim back when it might have mattered.",
    "Or because it's an expansion of access in more Democratic areas?",
    "That it could be perceived as either, of course, is the point.",
    "Perdue's turn as a voter-fraud crusader remains awkward.",
    "It's an extension of what happened after 2020.",
    "But Perdue was hardly a voter-fraud crusader.",
    "Heller stayed quiet after the 2020 election.",
    "Curbside voting is corrupt? because  why?",
    "Perdue's dance is a familiar one.",
    "Earlier this month, Alabama Gov.",
    "Both lost, regardless.",
    "Because of fraud?"
