    "I actually did better than he did against a guy that was a former United States senator and is a multimillionaire that had, you know, 100 percent name ID because of a runoff that he lost to Jon Ossoff, Kemp said, adding, So, I think the party is going to come together to beat Stacey Abrams and to send a message to Joe Biden and to send some relief to Washington, DC.",
    "Kemp added, This environment nationally and in Georgia for Democrats right now, theyre the party of Joe Biden, 40-year-high inflation, disaster at the border, more rules and regulations, more taxes, you know, just a broken Washington that hasnt gotten hardly anything done, and Georgians are frustrated with that  and thats exactly where Stacey Abrams would take us.",

    "Kemp says, however, that the political landscape in the Peach State has also changed and contends that his record of accomplishments as governor coupled with the ever-sagging approval of Democrats in Washington will work in his favor.",
    "Back in 2018, Kemp beat Abrams by a razor-thin margin of just over one percent of the vote, and Abrams famously refused to concede at the time, saying, I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right.",

    "A recent poll taken by SurveyUSA provided an early glimpse of the Kemp-Abrams contest, showing Kemp five points ahead of Abrams, 50 percent to 45 percent.",
    "If you look at Nathan Deal  when he got his second nomination, he had less percentage of the vote than I did against two very unknown candidates.",

    "The governor added, I appreciate  and Ive said this before  I appreciate all President Trump did to help our state, and he did a lot.",
    "When asked about Trump endorsing his primary opponent, Kemp brushed it off, saying, Ive never said anything bad about Donald Trump.",
