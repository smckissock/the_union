    "Young also had no trouble beating Peter Gruenstein in 1988, though this contest would have some unpleasant consequences when the Democrat sued the congressman for slander after the Republican accused him of having laundered money.?\nYoung appeared to be in for another easy general election win in 1990 against former Valdez Mayor John Devens, but this campaign proved to be very different from what he was accustomed to.",
    "In October he addressed Wasilla High School, where a student had recently died by suicide, and, among many other things, was quoted blaming suicides on a lack of support from family? and a lack of support from friends.?

    "The new incumbent quickly received credit when Congress approved the trans-Alaska pipeline, and he soon established a reputation for securing vital federal money for his isolated state; his ability to obtain appropriations for heavily Native American areas also earned him a longtime base of support among a usually reliably Democratic constituency.",
    "Young soon returned to form by winning his next seven campaigns by double digits, but his standing at home took a huge hit during the 2008 cycle in the face of a federal investigation into his ties to major donors, which included allegations that he'd helped secure a $10 million highway earmark in Florida that aided a developer.",
    "Governors\n? GA-Gov: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that former Sen.

OK-Sen-B: Yet another one-time member of Donald Trump's cabinet is reportedly considering a bid for public office this year: Former EPA chief Scott Pruitt has been \"making calls to gauge support\" for a potential campaign for the soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat held by Republican Jim Inhofe, according to CBS News.",

    "However, the politics in Yudichak's district were utterly transformed in the years when he wasn't on the ballot, which saw his constituency swinging from a 54-45 win for Barack Obama in 2012 to a 57-40 margin for Trump in 2016.",
