    "To give you a sense of the magnitude: In high-poverty schools that were remote for more than half of 2021, the loss was about half of a school years worth of typical achievement growth...There are 50 million students in the U.S. About 40 percent, or 20 million students, nationally were in schools that conducted classes remotely for less than four weeks, and 30 percent, or 15 million students, remained in remote instruction for more than 16 weeks.",

    "It analyzed achievement data from 2.1 million students in 10,000 schools across 49 states and is the first in a series that will be tracking the impact of catch-up efforts over the next two years...We found that districts that spent more weeks in remote instruction lost more ground than districts that returned to in-person instruction sooner.",

    "There are a great deal of \"now it can be said\" admissions happening these days, including this one:\nOn average, students who attended in-person school for nearly all of 2020-21 lost about 20 percent worth of a typical school years math learning during the studys two-year window.",
    "It's a shameful outrage that millions of American students were locked out of classrooms for nearly a year-and-a-half by ostensibly pro-science adults, due largely to (1) horrible risk assessment, (2) a collective, panicked aversion to data, and (3) tribal partisan politics.",
    "A new study out of Harvard attempts to quantify at least some of the damage:\nA new report on pandemic learning loss found that high-poverty schools both spent more weeks in remote instruction during 2020-21 and suffered large losses in achievement when they did so.",
    "And it's not past tense, in some cases, which brings us back to the Boston example:\nBoston public schools are *still* imposing mandatory masking for students  with no scientific justification, and despite increasingly clear downsides to childrens development.",
    "In many places, especially areas of the country dominated by Democrats and their teachers union patrons, that essential decision was not made until the following fall  resulting in acute and disastrous learning loss for millions of students.",

    "This study is another data point proving that Democrat-driven COVID safetyism, which departed dramatically from actual science, did disproportionate and lasting harm to countless non-privileged children in the United States.",
