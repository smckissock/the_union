    "And the court, the Supreme Court did not issue a written opinion explaining its decision, but the five far right justices on the court or the five most far right justices, I should say, all voted in favor of this stay, which has the effect of saying that Alabama's Republican drawn map with the six white districts and one black district, that's going to be used for 2022, despite the obvious violations of the Voting Rights Act and the obvious efforts to prevent black voters from having their say in the political process.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nAnd it's arts with getting as many people as we can into the panel from all parts of the country, all demographic characteristics, all political perspectives, so that when it comes time for us to create a sample, which is part random and part based on what we know about the demographic characteristics and political characteristics of the country, there's a very large pool of people who are interested in participating and will be eligible to participate and will participate.",
    "David Nir:\nI would add to your point Beard, that even if Alabama were to draw a second black opportunity district, that the makeup of the state's congressional districts would still overwhelmingly favor white people, because you would still have five of seven districts with white majorities, meaning that they would elect Republicans because voting is very racially polarized in the south and especially Alabama.",
    "And it turns out that it works just as well if not better than traditional telephone sampling, because response rates on telephones are so low, people are moving away from landline telephones to cell phones, mobile phones, which have very different laws governing how they can be contacted, especially among young people it's very hard to get young people to respond to telephone surveys.",
    "David Beard :\nSo, Senator Sinema, given her terrible, terrible ratings among Democrats, again, this is two years away, but it seems like somebody who would be like extremely vulnerable to a more progressive primary challenger who isn't standing in the way of everything practically that president Biden wants to do and repeatedly making most of the Democratic party very angry.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nBut this is something that we're going to be following very closely because young people who are traditionally in a very important part of Democratic coalition, if they decide not to vote in the 2022 election, then this could turn a situation that is not looking great for the Democrats right now into a situation that is much worse for the Democrats.",
    "David Beard :\nWhat was expected to be a very narrow race, where polling sort of yo-yoed a bit between a very close race between the center-left Socialists and the center-right Social Democratic Party, turned into a unexpectedly large victory for the Socialists prime minister Antonio Conte, who's been in office since 2015, won his largest victory.",
    "The instances that you mentioned are really good examples of both in 2021 in Canada and in 2017 in the UK, when Theresa May called the snap election after she became prime minister, they were both elections that didn't seem necessary and there was a lot of questions both by opponents and by the electorate of why are we having this election?",
    "And so we do a lot of research throughout the early part of election years, and this continues into the summer as well, but trying to gauge who is interested in voting, who is excited about voting and who intends to vote, so that we can try to come up with a projection of what the voting population in November is going to be.",
    "I have one thing to add, is that the facts on the ground that change because a lot of people on the other side of the point, if this was good enough for Alabama in 1992 and 2002 and 2012, et cetera, is that the percentage of African Americans in Alabama has grown as a portion of the state over the past 30 years.",
    "It's something that we are very interested in, both as folks who do political polling, but also from a methodological standpoint, because one of the things that we as pollsters are responsible for as we get into the summer, is coming up with polling that is not only of registered voters, but of likely voters.",
    "There was a real period a few years ago where it seemed like both more radical left-wing parties or more aggressive left-wing parties and sort of centricity liberal parties were sort of combined to eat away at the sort of traditional center-left parties, which are normally the socialists in Europe.",
    "And so we've started studying this already asking folks how excited they are and if they intend to vote so that we can build up a model of whether or not we think that the electorate this year is going to be say, older than who is registered, more Democratic, more Republican, you name it.",
    "She raised more than nine million dollars, but an amazing thing happened this week, which is that the Republican Governor's Association, which helps Republicans win races for governor all across the nation, announced it was going to start spending on ads on behalf of Kemp in the primary.",
    "So this was a very conservative panel that agreed entirely with the plaintiffs and said, \"Yeah, Alabama needs to have a second black district and the legislature better get on it right away and draw a new map that gives black voters the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate.\"",
    "But the other Senator who's been standing in the way a fair amount is Joe Manchin from West Virginia, who is in a very different position in large part due the fact that he represents West Virginia, it's a very different state than Arizona, which is very much a swing state.",
    "with Drew Linzer\nThe Downballot\nFollowShare\n0:0044:10\n15301xFeb 10, 2022\n image/svg+xml\nPowered by Libsyn\nPowered by Libsyn\nDavid Beard :\nHello, I'm David Beard, contributing editor for Daily Kos Elections, here with my co-host Daily Kos political director, David Nir.",
    "Suffice to say, still there's a lot of candidates in that race, so I don't know whether or not Jones will actually come out of it, but obviously having Trump's endorsement in a Republican primary is a good benefit leaving Perdue and Kemp to duke it out mano a mano.",
    "And Elena Kagan, one of the liberals on the court called him out for it and said that the opinion below was almost unquestionably decided correctly and that the court was essentially engaged in lawless nonsense in trying to block the ruling from taking effect.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nSo scientific sampling to get representative groups of Americans, and then all of the sort of traditional waiting and modeling techniques that go into analyzing the survey results to get the final answers that we publish and release out publicly.",
    "And this is not a case where the claim has come out of nothing, it's come out of on the ground changes to the state of Alabama that are inconvenient for Republicans and so they don't want to acknowledge it or draw that second district that they should draw.",
    "David Nir:\nI think this buttress is the argument that we have made all along at Daily Kos on the activism side that for progressives who want actual progress, the goal has to be to make Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema irrelevant by electing more Democrats.",
    "This is the case, even though Alabama's black population is about 27% of the state, meaning that just on the pure numbers, it's pretty clear that Alabama could elect two candidates preferred by black voters if only there were two black districts.",
    "And here's the thing, it's not just about this one case in Alabama, many other states in the south that are run by Republicans could draw an additional district if not more than one, where black voters could elect their preferred candidates.",
    "David Beard :\nSo, it's still pretty common that when people think about polling, they think about, Gallup, the 20th century of calling a bunch of landlines until they've got a complete, so they have enough people to get a good response rate.",
    "So, it's got a lot of benefits over traditional survey methodology which struggles with low response rates and other issues having to do with telephone interviewing these days while maintaining very high standards of quality and accuracy.",
    "David Nir:\nSo, speaking of technology coming a long way, one other huge way that Civiqs differs from traditional polling is, with a standard poll, maybe up pollster is going into the field to talk to voters for three, four, five days.",
    "There was a concurring opinion by Brett Kavanaugh that was only joined by one other justice in which he claimed that the ruling by the lower court had to be blocked from going into effect because the elections are coming up too soon.",
    "So, maybe you could talk a little bit about how you ensure that you still get a representative sample, even though people are choosing to participate as opposed to telephone polls, where people are sort of being made to participate.",
    "There was a lot of talk last year after the withdrawal from Afghanistan about how that was a defining moment, but really opinion had been turning against president Biden before that, and only continued the downward trend after that.",
    "And then all of a sudden Jones drops out of this governor's race and parachutes into one of the congressional races that's open, Georgia's 10th district, which is open because the current incumbent is running for secretary state.",
    "The decision was so extreme that even John Roberts, the chief justice, who has devoted his career dating back to his time as a young attorney to undermining the Voting Rights Act that every turn even he dissented from this stay.",
    "David Nir:\nWhat the Supreme Court is saying is not only are we not going to say it's a requirement for Alabama in 2022, we are very probably going to rule against VRA section two in some way that renders it inert in the future.",
    "Obviously though, a key difference is the fact that with traditional telephone polling, at least in the lay understanding, calling a bunch of people at random to try to get as random representative of the sample as possible.",
    "And one of the biggest advantages of having an online panel in place for sampling at least, is that people volunteer lots of demographic characteristics about themselves as part of helping us understand what Americans think.",
    "With the telephone poll, at least in theory, everyone has a telephone and you can randomly call the phone numbers that everyone has and they don't have to sign up in advance or anything like that, you just call them.",
    "And we have some pretty advanced statistical techniques that we use to process this data and smooth out the daily ups and downs in the daily samples and produce trendlines on what Americans think about politics.",
    "And so instead of going and voting for Democrats like they did in 2020, they just stay home, which is something that has often plagued Democrats in midterms where democratic presidents have been in office.",
    "So it wasn't the regularly scheduled election because the two left-wing parties rejected the budget of the minority government, which was the Socialist party, who's the main center-left party in Portugal.",
    "David Beard :\nAnd the safe assumption going back since Trump first became the nominee back in 2016, is that if you got Trump support, you are really, really in a favored position in a Republican primary.",
    "And a federal court agreed with a set of plaintiffs that said that under the VRA, specifically section two of the Voting Rights Act that Alabama had violated that and had to draw a second black district.",
    "We are going to be talking about redistricting litigation in Alabama, the Republican primary for governor in Georgia, and then interesting international election that brought some good news for the left.",
    "We've also got two other episodes out now, one with Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas that covers the history of Daily Kos Elections and why we do the work we do and why we're so passionate about it.",
    "So, because Donald Trump is so angry about the reality of the situation, he's decided to push Perdue into this race, convince Perdue to run, to give him his backing, to record ads on behalf of Perdue.",
    "And we can use that information to sample them accurately and make sure that we're getting a pretty accurate breakdown of people with all different characteristics at the time the sample is generated.",
    "And so Vernon Jones who was first elected as a Democrat from Georgia in the state house and has recently turned into a Republican and has become extremely Trumpy and is notably also African American.",
    "He saw a slight uptick in his approval following the signing of the infrastructure bill, but pretty much immediately after that, the Omicron variant of COVID was classified and started spreading.",
    "Now, I think that there's a good chance the court will again find the favor of plaintiffs, but unfortunately I think there's an even better chance that the Supreme Court would do the same thing.",
    "Every week, David Nir and contributing editor David Beard will highlight some of the key stories in the world of downballot electionsespecially those that dont always generate the big headlines.",
    "So, it's a technology that we're very excited about and it lets us do very large quantities of polling on lots of questions all the time, everywhere in a way that is accurate and sustainable.",
    "You can't try to deprive voters who are from racial minorities of their ability to elect candidates of their choice by chopping them up amongst a bunch of different congressional districts.",
    "And please take the surveys and it's a really great way to participate if you've ever wondered why no one ever calls you, all these polls you're hearing about, here's something you can do.",
    "In our third episode, we talk about redistricting in Alabama and the GOP primary for governor in Georgia before exploring the world of online polling with Civiqs co-founder Drew Linzer.",
    "David Nir:\nThe fun thing here is that Perdue for all of Trump's extremely loud mouth support and incredible abuse that he's heaped on Brian Kemp, has been a pitiful fundraiser so far.",
    "David Nir:\nLater on the show, we are going to be talking with Drew Linzer, who is the director and co-founder of Civiqs, one of the leading all online polling firms in the country.",
    "When he started up back in April of 2020, people had not really heard of him more than half of the voters in Georgia who we were polling back then said they were unsure about him.",
    "And the reasons for that are many, but there are just so many races to worry about going on right now that how can we possibly talk about 2024, when we haven't even done 2022 yet.",
    "But you guys are taking a totally different approach to both how often you contact people and also how you report and gather results for the questions that you have in the field.",
    "I am sure that in the United States, there are many times when presidents or congressional leaders wish they could call an early election when they're riding high in the polls.",
    "And we put out a monthly poll trying to understand in greater detail explanation and nuance behind all sorts of things, but including President Biden's falling approval rating.",
    "And in particular, Americans age 18 to 34 who were crucial to his election victory, who had a plus 13 approval rating for Biden when he took office, he's underwater 30 points.",
    "So, for the longest time as we've been tracking Joe Manchin, even though he was generally supported by most Democrats slim margin, he was strongly opposed by Republicans.",
    "In May there was some controversy around her not attending a January 6th commission vote and some other ways that she was behaving in public and decision she was making.",
    "He had higher than normal number of people saying that they weren't quite sure about him yet, but that's what you would expect for someone at that stage in his campaign.",
    "One was asking Americans their level of satisfaction with a whole battery of elements of life in America today, and seeing what exactly they were so dissatisfied about.",
    "David Beard :\nAnd what we've seen is that they've rebounded really well both here in Portugal, but also in Spain, in Germany, where they recently took power last fall.",
    "And he's doing this in large part because Donald Trump doesn't like that Brian Kemp decided to acknowledge the results of the 2020 election that Joe Biden won Georgia.",
    "It's very unfortunate because the state of the Supreme Court is what it is, but there's a lot of great folks fighting for this in the south and all across the country.",
    "So, what have you seen over the past year that sort of caused this drop in any sort of particular demographics that stick out at you that's been a particular problem?",
    "And by the time he won his election in January, the runoff election attitudes towards him had basically evened out so that he had a slight favorable rating advantage.",
    "David Nir:\nWe've been talking with Drew Linzer, the director and co-founder of Civiqs, one of the leading online polling and analytics companies in the United States.",
    "So that's something that's a real positive to see after they were as a stretch of really unfortunate election results in Europe where the right really seem decedent.",
    "And that margin allowed them to gain a majority of just their party, which means they won't have to rely on any left-wing parties to pass the budgets going forward.",
    "So, Civiqs is an entirely online polling firm, which means that we conduct interviews with people all across the United States on a regular basis on the internet.",
    "So had this primary gone with three notable figures, there's a good chance that there would've been a runoff, which would've been weeks of extra primary campaign.",
    "They want to keep the state's delegation, six Republicans and one Democrat and pack as many black voters as they can into this one single congressional district.",
    "As Daily Kos Political Director David Nir announced this morning, Daily Kos is extremely excited to announce the launch of our brand-new podcast, The Downballot!",
    "And all the studies that have come out recently comparing the accuracy of online polling with telephone polling, show that they're pretty much on par these days.",
    "So perhaps sticking with fixed elections, maybe you should just be careful what you wish for and having regularly timed elections is maybe the better approach.",
    "But I think we've seen a fair number of times on the international scene that these kind of calculations can go badly awry, or at least not work out as hoped.",
    "I love to follow along with disastrous Republican primaries, and we don't know how disastrous this one's going to get yet, but I have a good feeling about it.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nBut if they get something on an email and they click it on their phone and they're in the line at the grocery store, it's very easy to complete.",
    "And so there's a reason that these two races are viewed as close, because opinions about both of these senators in their home states are very evenly divided.",
    "David Beard :\nWith us today is Drew Linzer, the director and co-founder of Civiqs, one of the leading online polling and analytics companies in the country.",
    "Well also bring on a guest to lead us into a deep dive around a major topic that will make you, our listeners, the best-informed political consumers around.",
    "Meaning that further claims under this very important plank of the Voting Rights Act will not be available to plaintiffs anywhere in order to get redress.",
    "And we're going to be discussing both how his company actually polls people on the internet and what he is seeing out there in the United States today.",
    "Only one of them has a black majority and is capable of electing black voters candidate of choice, which is almost always going to be a black Democrat.",
    "And like we said, we're definitely going to check in with you Drew, later this cycle to see how the polling is looking in all of these key Senate rate.",
    "Joe Manchin on the other hand, right now is in positive favorable territory for the first time ever, that we've been tracking his favorable rating.",
    "His approval rating fell to about even by March of 2021 and held there for some time and then really started falling again around May of last year.",
    "But we don't know right now, will these young people who are largely unhappy with Joe Biden, still largely voting Democratic on the generic ballot.",
    "And so I think folks have assumed, oh, Perdue, former statewide official, very prominent had Trump's endorsement, he would just walk all over Kemp.",
    "As I said, it's something that we're very proud about, it's a unique thing that we offer and I'd love it if folks listening would go check it out.",
    "Advice for me to all the international parties out there, if you're going to call a snap election, you better have a really good reason to do so.",
    "Folks sign up to participate in polls, which is a great way to have their voices heard, people really enjoy taking the surveys that we send them.",
    "Obviously though, Republicans in the legislature don't want to draw a second black district, because that would mean electing a second Democrat.",
    "Even if you worry to get your hands on such a list, laws forbid you from doing that, we actually get permission from everybody to email folks.",
    "And the good thing is that this result is part of sort of a broader revitalization of center-left parties across Europe in the past few years.",
    "David Nir:\nSo, I think there's no question that online polling has grown a great deal in popularity and also in acceptance in recent years.",
    "But we'd like to ask before we let you go, how can our listeners find out more about Civiqs and how can they participate in Civiqs polling?",
    "So it's become this big incumbent GOP governor that has a lot of support in the state against this Trumpest former Senator who is really...",
    "For the more in depth question of why we do do supplementary polling on a whole range of topics, including in partnership with Daily Kos.",
    "David Beard :\nAnd another important factor in all this is going to be turnout, which is not something that is-\nDrew Linzer:\nI would say.",
    "And we have some scientific sampling methods that we use to select from among all the people who have signed up to take surveys with us.",
    "And that is one of the necessary conditions that Stacy Abrams needs to win this election in November is a very messy Republican primary.",
    "So in the Georgia governor's race, Brian Kemp who narrowly and controversially defeated Stacy Abrams in 2018, is running for reelection.",
    "I think the key and maybe the distinction here in Portugal is that the election was really necessary because the budget failed to pass.",
    "David Beard :\nAnd this year in this election, they got 7% and they're going to have a number of new members of parliament in Portugal.",
    "We'll hit one last topic in this week's weekly hits, and we're going to a favorite arena of Beard's, which is international elections.",
    "When you type in your email address, we send you a little email that says welcome to the Civiqs panel, and that's really all it takes.",
    "I am very worried\n 66%\n19 votes\nI am somwhat worried\n 21%\n6 votes\nI am not worried\n 14%\n4 votes\nThis is a short blurb about Daily Kos.",
    "And so we have been tracking a Mark Kelly's favorable rating and Raphael Warnock's next favorable rating going back to April of 2020.",
    "Well, starting around last spring, April, May, June, July, we started seeing Republicans in West Virginia warming up to Joe Manchin.",
    "And the way that this is all possible is that our survey methodology enables us to interview folks from the panel every single day.",
    "Now, there is one little here, which is that there's an additional set of claims that plaintiffs brought that were not adjudicated.",
    "And of course protecting the vulnerable Democratic senators we were talking about earlier, such as Mark Kelly and Raphael Warnock.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nWe were one of the first firms doing a lot of tracking who sounded the alarm about Biden's declining approval rating.",
    "David Nir:\nSo we have to talk about what the Supreme court just did in Alabama with a lawsuit over the state's congressional map.",
    "The Downballot is a weekly podcast dedicated to the mini elections that take place below presidency from Senate to city council.",
    "David Nir:\nAnd he said he thought it was inappropriate to the extent that the Republicans in the court even tried to justify it.",
    "And he is not the only Republican as David Perdue who lost to Jon Osoff in the Georgia runoff last year has decided to also run.",
    "In his case, it's almost certainly going to be former NFL star Herschel Walker and Mark Kelly against his opponents in Arizona.",
    "And that would be Kyrsten Sinema, who of course has become just about progressive enemy number one within the Democratic party.",
    "And so he's jumped into this open race, he soon after of course got Trump's endorsement, which certainly is convenient for him.",
    "Advertising dollars have been gobbled up by Big Tech and cash-strapped outlets are being bought and sold to the highest bidder.",
    "And it's just a really rich and detailed look at how American public opinion has evolved on a wide range of issues over time.",
    "And when we started tracking her, the polling on her was fairly similar to what you would expect for any democratic Senator.",
    "It's been mirrored, not great at an extent, but it's been mirrored in an increase in her favorable rating among Republicans.",
    "People just don't have the patience that they might have had 20 years ago to answer a 20, 30 minute survey on the telephone.",
    "We are primarily accountable to readers like you because donations from readers like you are our biggest source of income.",
    "And so it's really been a lot lower to happen in Portugal than it has in other countries, but it's arrived there as well.",
    "And we actually are showing her with over 50 per percent favorable rating among Republicans and a 20% unfavorable rating.",
    "One of the things that we're able to do is track favorable ratings for every state level politician in the United States.",
    "And until we get a new court or frankly, an expanded court, it's something that we are simply going to have to live with.",
    "And we've seen both with the money distinction with the way that Kemp has sort of fought back aggressively against this.",
    "We release the results of daily tracking polls that we conduct on a huge range of topical questions, political interest.",
    "And what it does is it sets up an official and very deep pocketed arm of the GOP in direct conflict with Donald Trump.",
    "What we've seen over time is that on balance he enjoyed a positive net favorable rating up until around May this year.",
    "On balance right now his unfavorable rating is slightly higher than his favorable rating, and it's been pretty steady.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nAnd even though the approval rating for former President Trump was never very high, it was always steady.",
    "But why don't we change gears and talk about something that at least could give us a little bit of shot of right here.",
    "Obviously once you get closer, you start to see likely voter models that can give you sort of a better sense of this.",
    "Very recently Civiqs made quite a splash with some polling also in Arizona, except the about Arizona's other Senator.",
    "So, from time to time, I'll pull out an interesting international election here in the weekly hits and talk about it.",
    "And he hasn't been pulling terribly well, but enough that there was a good chance that he could push it to a primary.",
    "And with the panel that you just described, folks are obviously opting into that to receive these emails from Civiqs.",
    "Right now, if you go there, you'll see results from polling we're doing about people's attitudes about the pandemic.",
    "And what's so remarkable about this, is that the RGA has never had to spend to save an incumbent's ass in a primary.",
    "And as much as I appreciate you all having me on the show, I'm afraid that I don't have a ton of good news to share.",
    "And so how has his sort of positioning and the way he's gone about the past year affected his favorability ratings?",
    "Drew Linzer:\nNot everyone gets interviewed every day obviously, but we are interviewing Americans every single day.",
    "And if you haven't already, please like and subscribe to The Downballot and leave us a five star rating and review.",
    "Five of seven seats, that's about 71% of the districts, but white people in Alabama are only 63% of the population.",
    "And so that's why two districts are now needed when originally in the early nineties, only one district was drawn.",
    "I want to call it a partisan Republican majority because that's what it is today, stayed that lower court ruling.",
    "Are we going to see turnout suffer in those groups in November if they continue to be unhappy with the president.",
    "The socialist won 42%, which was 13% more than the second place, Social Democratic Party, who just won only 29%.",
    "I think that people are genuinely increasingly disapproving of the job that they feel President Biden is doing.",
    "Can you tell us a little bit about that polling and kind of maybe talk a little bit about the buzz that it got?",
    "One concerning thing from the election is that Chega, a far right party in Portugal, saw a significant rise.",
    "Is simply between our tracking of Biden's approval rating and former President Trump's job approval rating.",
    "This sort of like, \"Oh, well, we've got the presidency, I'm not really happy with what we've accomplished.",
    "He is going to give it everything is got, and he's not afraid to scour the field if that's what it takes.",
    "David Beard :\nSo this is not a case of... Republicans often like to accuse Democrats of inventing claims.",
    "Well, last I checked, I looked at my calendar, the elections are in November, this is February right now.",
    "And in many cases, some of these results track Americans opinions daily going back five, six more years.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nHe hit a low in our polling in the mid thirties, and it's been staying pretty steady there.",
    "So in Arizona, because of the trends we were just talking about, Senator Sinema is underwater 20 points.",
    "I think we all know that even no matter what poll you look at, be it the Civiqs polling or other polls.",
    "And in a lot of the Nordic countries where the center-left is either in power or in power in coalition.",
    "And this is the key distinguishing feature between the traditional telephone poll and the online poll.",
    "David Nir:\nNow, will you run polls at any point, testing Raphael Warnock against his likely opponents.",
    "So, why don't you tell us a little bit about how Civiqs does things in the current modern online era?",
    "And obviously Donald Trump doesn't want that because Donald Trump wants to stomp all over Brian Kemp.",
    "Whereas online, there is no registry of everyone's email address that you can just send an email to.",
    "David Nir:\nThe problem for Alabama Republicans is that the Voting Rights Act says you can't do that.",
    "And the methodologies are very comparable to what would be used in a traditional telephone survey.",
    "On balance, Democrats said they had a favorable opinion of her and Republicans said they did not.",
    "So he is facing a very different environment in West Virginia than Senator Sinema is in Arizona.",
    "Brian Kemp reported raising seven million dollars and had something like 12 million to the bank.",
    "David Nir:\nAnd the beautiful thing is that it really does seem to toss up the polling out there.",
    "And we've also seen that in Israel where often the budget failing is what leads to an election.",
    "I'm pretty happy with the 2020 results, can't we just stick with those for a couple more years?",
    "And on top of that there's no sense that you can randomly generate email addresses to contact.",
    "They are the government, they proposed the budget, but it relied on the two left-wing parties.",
    "David Beard :\nBut for a while, there's been a third sort of notable Republican in the primary.",
    "And then we've also got a 2022 midterm overview with Daily Kos elections editor, Jeff Singer.",

    "When he took office, we had him in positive territory, plus five approval versus disapproval.",
    "So, Civiqs has been tracking attitudes towards Senator Sinema going back to January of 2020.",

    "And that's C-I-V-I-Q-S, we are an online company, so we have to spell our name wrong.",
    "So, I want to take us to Portugal where they held a general election on January 30th.",

    "Stay tuned and wait for another email from us every couple of weeks or so.",
    "Drew Linzer:\nSo that's within our margin of error, but it's really tight.",

    "The lower court has now asked for briefing on those claims.",
    "In 2019, when the last election was held they got just 1%.",
    "The situation is much less clear as to whom he might face.",
    "And if we look at Raphael Warnock, it's a similar pattern.",
    "If you would like to join the panel, it's completely free.",
    "And in contrast, approval for President Biden has fallen.",
    "And it makes for a much more efficient and clean process.",
    "David Nir:\nWell, I could say the same thing about the US.",

    "David Nir:\nYou mentioned that this was a snap election.",
    "And as a quick ask, please subscribe to The Downballot.",
    "What do Bidens approval ratings mean for the midterms?",
    "And you click a link in the email and take the survey.",
    "If you click that button, you can take a short survey.",
    "And that's pretty different from how Civiqs operates.",
    "David Beard :\n... easy to pull particularly so early.",
    "And that's exactly what we've got turning out to be.",
