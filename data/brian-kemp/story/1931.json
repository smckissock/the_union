Butterfield has endorsed state Sen. Don Davis in the May 17 primary to succeed him.",
    "But Berman argued that Republicans might have to avail themselves of this option: He predicted that \"[t]here's a good chance\" that DePerno could lose his law license or be indicted, which Bridge Michigan explains is a reference to a pair of investigationsone by the state's Attorney Grievance Commission, the other by the state policeinto DePerno's lawsuits aimed at overturning Trump's loss in Michigan.",
    "One reason he may be holding off on making a decision, though, is that several advocacy groups and Florida voters filed a lawsuit in state court last week alleging that the new map violates the state constitution's prohibitions on partisan gerrymandering and diluting minority representation, which could result in something close to the existing 5th District getting revived if the plaintiffs prevail.",
    "Hatch then decided to take a chance and ask Ronald Reagan, who had just lost the presidential nod to incumbent Gerald Ford, for an endorsement; Reagan delivered, though Hatch's team had to alter Reagan's telegram backing Warren Hatch.? After winning the nomination in a 65-35 landslide, Hatch spent the general election saying of Moss, What do you call an 18-year incumbent?",
    "Dissenters may get another shot, though: Under state law, both Democrats and Republicans are actually required to pick nominees for these two offices (plus lieutenant governor) at their August conventions; these April gatherings are a recent innovation to allow candidates to get an earlier start on their campaigns, but they don't have any official imprimatur.",

    "Additionally, prior to his initial 2016 victory in the current 5th following court-ordered redistricting, Lawson made two runs for Congress in older versions of the 2nd District that contained a large majority of the new 2nd's territory, coming up short by close margins in the 2010 primary and 2012 general election.",

    "Hatch, who worked as an attorney, was a first-time candidate and political unknown when he joined the 1976 GOP race to take on Democratic incumbent Frank Moss, a decision his family and friends tried to talk him out of in order to spare him what they saw as an all-but-certain defeat.",
    "The independent also focused on recent revelations that Lee worked to overturn Trump's 2020 defeat in his brief speech to convention delegates Saturday, saying, \"We will show the rest of the country how we beat people like Mike Lee who try to overturn our democracy in the shadows.\"",
    "Michels co-owns a construction company and previously ran for office a couple of times in previous decades, but his last attempt way back in 2004 saw him decisively lose that year's Senate contest as the GOP nominee against former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, who prevailed 55-44.",
    "However Lawson argued that his ties to the area are much deeper and broader than a quick glance at the toplines might suggest: Lawson represented much of this area, including several conservative counties outside of Tallahassee, when he was in the state Senate from 2000 to 2010.",
    "? MA-04: Former Brookline Selectwoman Jesse Mermell, who just barely came up short by 22-21 in the crowded Democratic primary against freshman Rep. Jake Auchincloss when the current version of this seat was open in 2020, has announced that she won't seek a rematch this cycle.",
    "In Utah, as we've previously explained, candidates either needed to have turned in the requisite number of signatures or win enough support at their state party convention, and while contenders can simultaneously try both options, Weston only went with the convention route.",

    "The GOP did not do a convention for the special election because redistricting was completed just before Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn died, though an endorsement for the regularly scheduled race still could have given one of the contenders a lift in the May 24 primary.",
    "But Hatch gained traction thanks to two influential allies: Brigham Young University President Ernest Wilkinson, who was the 1964 nominee against Moss, and former Salt Lake City police chief Cleon Skousen, who was a powerful member of the far-right John Birch Society.",
    "In addition to Biden's support, Schrader headed into the primary's final stretch with a large financial advantage: Schrader outraised McLeod-Skinner in the first quarter by $714,000 to $314,000 and started April with a $2.7 million to $310,000 edge in cash-on-hand.",

    "Those numbers, though, were the result of a clerical error that was quickly corrected to reflect Trump's actual 61-37 win in the county, and a hand-count audit confirmed that voting machines provided by Dominion Voting Systems had correctly tabulated the results.",

    "Had they not included that second step, Donald Trump's margin in the 2nd would have shrunk to about 51-46 and made the seat vulnerable; instead, it stays at 57-41 Trump, similar to the old district's 56-41 margin for Trump.",
    "This will be the third face-off between Curtis and Herrod for a safely red seat in the Provo area and southeastern Utah: Curtis won the 2017 special primary 43-33, and he prevailed 73-27 in their rematch the following year.",
