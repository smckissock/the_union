    "He also pitched a buffet of hot-button school issues that the governor put under the umbrella of parents' rights.? After nearly two years of COVID school closures, mask mandates, online school, and more, parent activists sent Republicans into this session with marching orders and most of those demands are now in legislation headed toward or across the finish line.",
    "In January, the governor told me his wanted single message heading into his reelection to be promises made, promises kept.?\nWhether you voted for me or not, you can at least say he's the guy that told us what he's gonna do when he got into office and did it.?\nIf that was his test for this legislative session, Kemp got the job done.",
    "Although Ralston has never endorsed the governor in his primary fight, the legislation that Ralston has delivered to get his own members reelected, including an expected across-the-board tax cut, will give Kemp fuel for his own campaign, too.",
    "Also empowering Kemp this session have been GOP lawmakers, with plenty of Trump supporters in their ranks, voting for the bills he's pushed and more often than not, flanking him at his press conferences, happy to be photographed by his side.",
    "As for Kemp's potential general election, Stacey Abrams has long criticized him for failing to expand Medicaid in Georgia, a move that would help rural Georgians in particular, which Kemp still opposes and the Legislature again failed to do.",
    "With the session now down to its last days, Kemp heads into his double-barrel election year having maximized the benefit of being a sitting Governor in Georgia and seeing nearly every priority he laid out in January complete or nearly done.",
    "Legislation to eliminate the current requirement for a permit to carry a concealed weapon in Georgia has now passed both the House and Senate, despite fierce resistance by Democrats, and appears poised to be headed for Kemp's desk soon.",
    "Less clear in the waning hours of the session is the fate of a bill that Kemp says would ensure fairness in sports,? meaning it would effectively ban transgender girls from participating in sports that align with their gender identity.",
    "If Kemp makes it past Perdue and into a rematch with Abrams in November, he'll also be able to point to bipartisan achievements, including some crafted not just with the approval of Democrats, but with their active input, too.",
    "And although Kemp did not push for more changes to elections in Georgia, Republicans in the General Assembly know their voters want more and they could deliver more restrictions that Democrats will pan as voter suppression.",
    "When I met with Gov Brian Kemp at the beginning of this legislative session, he said he was proud of the work that he had done in his first three years as governor and he laid out his plans for the 40 days ahead.",
    "Close to wrapping up, but not there yet, is House Bill 1084, a controversial measure that would ban teaching divisive concepts,? including Critical Race Theory, in Georgia classrooms.",
    "It would be his last session before facing a primary challenge from former Sen. David Perdue in May and, if all goes according to plan, a November rematch against Stacey Abrams.",
    "Perdue has mocked those measures election-year gimmicks? and exactly what Georgians hate about politicians.?\nAre pay hikes for teachers and tax cuts election-year gimmicks?",
    "Along with red meat for the right, Kemp is also poised to deliver on several issues that could play well in November against Stacey Abrams, assuming he gets that far.",
    "Last-minute bills could also greenlight further abortion restrictions that most Georgians oppose, along with other chicanery that Kemp may not even know about yet.",
    "The bill to overhaul Georgia's last-in-the-nation mental health and substance abuse treatment access was the brainchild of GOP House Speaker David Ralston.",
    "In Ralston Kemp has had a powerful ally this year, a like-minded conservative with a caucus to protect and a policy agenda not far from Kemp's own.",
    "That includes the bill Kemp signed this week at a Capitol press conference to let parents opt out of mask mandates for their kids in school.",
    "In January, the governor called for big pay raises for all state employees and teachers, along with tax refunds for Georgia taxpayers.",
    "Another base-pleasing focus for Kemp this session was a new anti-gang unit for the GBI and recruiting bonuses for police officers.",
    "And he's done it with the help of a GOP House and Senate full of Trump supporters, despite having become Donald Trump's Enemy No.",
    "The governor headlined an early January press conference pushing Constitutional Carry? at a giant shooting range in Cobb County.",
    "Those Republicans may not be running against Perdue, but, like Kemp, many have primary challenges of their own to fend off.",
    "Let's start with the so-called Constitutional Carry? bill, since Kemp started off the year with that first, too.",
    "Also headed to Kemp's desk is a new law to ban obscene materials,? from school libraries, in Kemp's words.",
    "That Kemp put it forward at all in his State of the State address in January was a win for some activists.",
    "The results of this legislative session give all of them enough red meat to fill a steakhouse.",
    "Tops on that list will be the Mental Health Parity Act, which passed both chambers Wednesday.",
    "And as Perdue is showing, they are also popular proposals that are hard to campaign against.",
    "But Kemp will be able to take some credit for that one as well when he signs it into law.",
    "It's a signal that even Republicans who support Trump can support this governor, too.",
    "Even before the end of the session, he signed the raises and refunds into law.",
    "And that may be Kemp's most powerful message of all heading into the primary.",
    "That's hard to imagine.",
    "Will voters hate them?",
    "Maybe.",
    "1."
