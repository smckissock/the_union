    "Back then, if you pointed out that all the Republicans in positions that really mattered in the aftermath of the 2020 election, across multiple states and multiple offices, did their jobs and declined to go along with Trump, the usual response was maybe it happened once but wouldnt happen again, because Trumps enmity was a guaranteed career-ender.",
    "I can easily imagine an alternative timeline where Raffensperger resigned his office rather than standing for re-election, inked a deal with MSNBC, turned his subsequent book into a mega-bestseller in the style of so many Trump-administration exposs and adopted Biden-administration talking points to denounce Georgia election laws.",
    "But as Ive marinated in the horror  and, increasingly, in rage at the police response  Ive also been aware of the way our media experience works today, how we are constantly cycled from one crisis to another, each one seemingly existential and yet seemingly forgotten when the wheel turns, the headlines change.",
    "Moreover, the primary balloting in Georgia saw record early-voting turnout and no evidence of meaningful impediments to voting, which exploded a different crisis narrative that took hold on the left  and in corporate America and the Biden White House  when the state passed new voting regulations last year.",
    "But the more important one was the Republican primary for secretary of state, in which Brad Raffensperger, the special target of Trumps strong-arm tactics and then his public ire, defeated Jody Hice, Trumps candidate  and did so without a runoff.",
    "Probably some crossover Democratic votes helped push him over 50 percent, but most of his voters were Republicans who listened to his challengers constant talk of voter fraud and decided to stick with the guy who stood up to Trump.",
    "In Georgia, the state at the center of the 45th presidents attempt to defy the public will and stay in office, there were two Republican primary races that doubled as referendums on the Trumpian demand that G.O.P.",
    "According to that narrative, in trying to address the paranoia of their own constituents, Republicans were essentially rolling back voting rights, even recreating Jim Crow  on steroids, to quote our president.",
    "Whereas because he stayed in the party, ran again and won, even in a dark week for America one region of our common life looks a little better, and one of our crises should feel a little bit less dire.",
    "Doug Mastrianos recent primary victory in Pennsylvania proves as much, and there may be other swing-state nominees who, like Mastriano, cant be trusted to imitate Kemp and Raffensperger in the clutch.",
    "Climate change, systemic racism, toxic masculinity, online disinformation, gun violence, police violence, the next Trump coup, the latest Covid variant, the death of democracy, climate change again.",
    "There was little good evidence for this narrative at the time, and even less evidence in the turnout rate for the Georgia primary, where early voting numbers were higher even than in 2020.",
    "That timeline would have unquestionably been better for the Raffensperger familys bank account, and it would have prompted many liberals to hail him as a profile in Republican courage.",
    "It shows the effectiveness of what you might call a stay and govern strategy of dealing with Trumps hold on the G.O.P., one with wide application as the party moves toward 2024.",
    "The higher-profile race was the battle for the gubernatorial nomination between Brian Kemp and David Perdue, which Kemp won in an extraordinary rout.",
    "Any Republican in a key swing-state office come 2024 can look at Kemp and Raffensperger and know that they have a future in G.O.P.",
    "But the results in Georgia prove that the faction that elevates figures like Mastriano does not have a simple veto in the party.",
    "But for everyone there are relatively few opportunities to take a breath and acknowledge when anything actually gets better.",
    "The Kemp victory was expected; the easy Raffensperger win less so, and certainly it wasnt expected at this time last year.",
    "In this one I want to acknowledge that in a different zone of existential agitation, things just meaningfully improved.",
    "Like many people, the mass shooting of children in Uvalde, Texas, is basically the only thing Ive read about for days.",
    "On the other hand the Trumpian peril, the risk of election subversion and constitutional crisis, does still exist.",
    "officials follow him into a constitutional crisis  and in both of them his candidate lost badly.",
    "But for everyone else  Georgians, the G.O.P., the country  that timeline would have been worse.",
    "And it indicates the limits of the all-or-nothing thinking that a crisis mentality imposes.",
    "So my next column will be about the darkness in Texas and the possible policy response.",
    "This is a column about good news, written in the shadow of the worst news imaginable.",
    "Jim Crow on steroids should be stricken from the crisis cycle; it does not exist.",
    "politics if, in the event of a contested election, they simply do their job.",
    "The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.",
    "This is the liberal crisis list; the conservative list is different.",
    "Wed like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.",
    "Now that narrative, happily, has been exploded.",
