    "Ahead of her last day Friday as White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki went on the record to defend old tweets from her incoming successor Karine Jean-Pierre that were resurfaced because they suggested elections in 2016 and 2018 were stolen.?\nJean-Pierre, colloquially known as KJP, also made some harsh comments about Fox News during an MSNBC guest appearance that some say cast doubt on her ability to impartially call balls and strikes at the Briefing Room podium.",
    "In December 2016, a month after Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, Jean Pierre tweeted: Stolen emails, stolen drone, stolen election ..welcome to the world of #unpresidented Trump.?\nStolen emails, stolen drone, stolen election ..welcome to the world of #unpresidented Trump https://t.co/NI7vqPV6cu\nPsaki told Mediate in a statement that Jean-Pierre has affirmed that Donald Trump won in 2016, too.",
    "But he won.?\nThen in 2020: Reminder: Brian Kemp stole the gubernatorial election from Georgians and Stacey Abrams.?\nReminder: Brian Kemp stole the gubernatorial election from Georgians and Stacey Abrams.https://t.co/ZIKGTd6U1v\nOn that tweet, Psaki said: We all agree the 2018 election in Georgia is settled.",
    "But Psaki, who has been press secretary since Bidens inauguration in January 2021, excused Jean-Pierres past comments, suggesting everyone agrees that the elections in question have been settled,? and arguing that KJPs views fell within bounds at the time she made them.",
    "Like so many of us, Karine was concerned about the U.S. intelligence communitys unanimous finding that Russia intervened to help Trump.",
    "And were also all concerned about voter suppression issues, including the President.",
    "Kemp won and she sees that tweet as having oversimplified the problem.?"
