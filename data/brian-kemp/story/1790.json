    "GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini tweeted on Monday that, in general, We're basically seeing a 5-10 point bump in primary polls from the Trump endorsement, which ain't nothing, but is far off his marks from 2018.?\nThe most recent major poll out of Ohio, from the Trafalgar Group, had Vance on 26 percent, state senator Matt Dolan on 22 percent, former state treasurer Josh Mandel on 21 percent and businessman Mike Gibbons on 13 percent.",
    "No single race is going to determine the potency of his endorsements but the confluence of all these primaries will provide that test.?\nMeanwhile, major figures in the party  most notably Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  have expressed concern about the GOP putting forth nominees who might lose seats in a general election that are otherwise winnable.",
    "When it comes to the other leading figures, these candidates have really had one message from the first moment and that is, I am Trumpier than thou,'? said David Niven, a professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati.",
    "People had picked who they were going to support, and it is difficult to move them out of those decisions.?\nStill, whether a defeat for Vance would really be a repudiation of Trump depends largely on who might beat him.",
    "Though McConnell did not name Trump, his arguments seemed squarely aimed at questionable picks from the former president, such as Oz and former football star Herschel Walker, who is running for the Senate in Georgia.",
    "For Niven, Trump's importance within the modern-day GOP isn't measured in the success or failure of endorsees like Vance but in the sheer number of Republican candidates running in the former president's image.",
    "Those include the Pennsylvania Senate primary, where he has endorsed television personality Mehmet Oz, and the gubernatorial race in Georgia, where Trump has eagerly sought a defeat for incumbent Gov.",
    "Some unaligned Republicans in the state contend that Trump waited too long to deliver his endorsement, especially given that early voting had already begun at that point.",
    "Republican candidates from far and wide have beaten a path to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to try to win his backing  testament to the perception of him as a kingmaker.",
    "Trump-the-concept is going to win whether or not Trump's candidate wins.?\nTrue to form, Trump remains the central focus of the Ohio race as primary day approaches.",
    "For all the heft Trump would claim to provide in a state that he carried by eight points in both his presidential campaigns, a Vance victory is far from assured.",
    "Another survey, from Emerson, also had Vance on 26 percent, with Mandel second (24 percent), Dolan third (21 percent) and Gibbons again fourth (17 percent).",
    "Trump has endorsed an enormous number of candidates across the country, but a handful of high-profile contests will serve as the litmus tests of his power.",
    "He is viewed as a Trump skeptic mainly because he never expected the former president's endorsement and doesn't advocate relitigating the 2020 election.",
    "Dolan's late polling rise has been the subject of much interest inside and outside the state, but most Ohio experts doubt he can pull off a victory.",
    "There's no doubt that Trump's endorsement, delivered in mid-April, was a jolt of rocket fuel for Vance, lifting him from third place to first.",
    "But the fact it has not propelled him fully clear from the pack leaves questions about how much Trump's backing matters.",
    "Two polls in the final stretch of the race have given him the lead, but by just four points and two points respectively.",
    "The Hill has removed its comment section, as there are many other forums for readers to participate in the conversation.",
    "Among the leading candidates, only Dolan has kept Trump at arm's length  and even he is far from a Never Trump figure.",
    "Mandel supporters have gleefully amplified past comments from Vance that were harshly critical of Trump and his base.",
    "I think any of these high-profile statewide races are tests of [Trump] in a way,? said GOP strategist Dan Judy.",
    "That's nowhere close to a comfortable advantage, especially in a primary where polls are notoriously volatile.",
    "There was a strategic mistake in waiting as late as he did,? said Ohio GOP strategist Matt Dole.",
    "In addition to early votes having been cast, he is fighting against made-up minds,? Dole argued.",
    "Voters in the Republican Senate primary will decide whether to make the Trump-endorsed J.D.",
    "Whether his candidate wins or loses, his mindset is going to win? in Ohio, Niven said.",
    "I'm not worried about it at all.?\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.",
    "President Trump faces his first major test of the 2022 election cycle on Tuesday.",
    "Vance their nominee  or to hand Vance and the former president a defeat.",
    "At a rally in Nebraska Sunday, Trump mangled the name of his endorsee.",
    "We invite you to join the discussion on Facebook and Twitter.",
    "Everybody's going to do that,? the candidate told CBS News.",
    "The Hillbilly Elegy? author is, at best, a narrow favorite.",
    "But cold-eyed analysis doesn't always tell the same story.",
    "Vance professed himself unbothered by the flub on Monday.",
