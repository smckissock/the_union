    "It's happening all over the city of Atlanta, and if you go all the way back to the summer when you had civil unrest and Antifa, a lot of other crazy people, coming to Georgia trying to burn our city down.",
    "I turned the state police department of community supervision, GBI, and other things, National Guard, to keep our city from getting burned down, and ever since then, we've been going after violent crime.",
