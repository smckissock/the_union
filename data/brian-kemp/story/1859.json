    "In the final debate before early voting begins May 2, the two Republican candidates sparred over familiar issues like the handling of the 2020 election, former President Trump's endorsement, crime in Georgia, and who had the better plans to stave off economic pain from record-high inflation.",
    "\"We've gotta have someone that will focus on today and focus on how we win in November -- not try to look back like David Perdue and Stacey Abrams have been, and not admit that they lost an election because they didn't have a record to win,\" Kemp said.",
    "At another point, Perdue accused Kemp of refusing to fix election laws after the November 2020 election related to signature verification, ballot harvesting, and unsecured drop boxes -- which he claimed contributed to his loss against Ossoff.",
    "GEORGIA GOP GUBERNATORIAL CLASH: KEMP CHARGES 'PERDUE GOT RICH SENDING JOBS TO CHINA'\nPerdue also stated that Georgia would attract more business if crime rates had been lower under Kemp's watch and the state had no income tax.",
    "Perdue accused Kemp of violating his oath of office by suppressing claims of voter fraud after the 2020 election, and blamed the governor for his own loss to Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in the January 2021 special election.",
    "Kemp called Perdue's plan to end the state income tax \"fuzzy, Washington D.C. math\" because it would require raising other taxes to make up for $14 billion in revenue -- around half of the state budget.",
    "Perdue's position was that even if Kemp won the primary nomination, he would never get Trump's endorsement  and that would likely mean he'd lose against Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams in November .",
    "\"I believe with [Trump's endorsement], and with everyone's help and vote, we will stop this madness and we will beat Stacey Abrams, even though our governor has divided the party,\" Perdue said.",
    "Perdue hit back that Kemp took \"several hundred million dollars\" to invest in a development with Rivian Automotive, an electric truck startup, which George Soros invested in earlier this year.",
    "\"Lord of mercy, there's a lot of spaghetti being thrown on the wall,\" Kemp responded, adding that the FBI, Georgia Bureau of Investigations and his own office had conducted investigations.",
    "Each candidate returned to familiar lines of attack related to the 2020 election, with Perdue charging that Kemp had divided the Republican Party and lost the trust of voters.",
    "Perdue defended his proposal to end the state income tax and called for the creation of \"an election law enforcement agency that does nothing but enforce election laws.\"",
    "\"Senator Perdue is lying about my record because he doesn't have one of his own,\" Kemp said, a phrase he repeated numerous times throughout the hour-long debate.",
    "GEORGIA GOV: FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO STOP RAISING FUNDS FOR KEMP\n\"People have lost confidence in you, and confidence in the voting system.",
    "Perdue insisted that he won the special election by 90,000 votes, to which Kemp responded: \"If you beat Jon Ossoff, why are you not a U.S.",
    "Brian Kemp pulled no punches in attacking each other Thursday night in a debate for the Republican Party nomination for governor.",
    "\"You can't go and change the laws in the middle of an election that's happening, which includes your runoff,\" he continued.",
    "You won't own up to the fact that you actually certified the election, governor, without investigation,\" Perdue said.",
    "GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE: KEMP LEADS TRUMP-BACKED PERDUE IN AJC POLL\n\"Lord of mercy, he's lying again folks.",
    "\"I'm in here to protect my state, this man has sold us out to the radical left,\" Perdue said.",
    "Kemp stridently defended his record and expressed exasperation at Perdue's statements.",
    "Georgia gubernatorial candidate and former Sen. David Perdue and incumbent Gov.",
    "\"Because you let him steal the election, governor,\" Perdue said.",
    "Kemp insisted he has the record to beat Abrams a second time.",
    "It's really sad,\" Kemp said.",
