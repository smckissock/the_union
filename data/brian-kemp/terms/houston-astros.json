    "sentence": "Kemp spokesman Cody Hall said, While former Senator Perdue spent an hour telling hollow lies about the Governor's record, Governor Kemp remained laser focused on reminding Georgians how he has delivered on his promises since taking office.?\nPerdue spokeswoman Jenni Sweat said, Tonight, David Perdue clearly demonstrated that <span class='selected-term'>Brian Kemp</span> is a weak Governor who divided our party and cannot win in November,? adding that a clear difference? between the two candidates is that Kemp believes Joe Biden won the election fair and square? whereas Perdue is a bold leader who will make waves and knock heads if that's what it takes to get things done, and tonight he held Governor Kemp accountable for his numerous failures.?\nThe debate comes as Perdue trails Kemp in fundraising and in most polls by roughly ten points.",
