    "And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.\"",
    "In Zechariah 14:8, a prophetic book about the Day of the Lord, what Christians believe to be the Second Coming of Jesus the Messiah, we learn, \"And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.\"",
    "\"And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh\" (Ezekiel 47:9).",
    "Later, in Jeremiah 17:13, we learn that this fountain of living waters is God Himself that has been forsaken: \"O Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.\"",
    "They are also theorizing that the vast reserves of highly pressurized \"primary water\" are actually causing quakes  again, just as the biblical Flood account described in Genesis 7:11 when \"all the fountains of the great deep [were] broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\"",
    "Tourists from all over the world come to the Dead Sea today to experience the healing properties of the minerals, the very low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation and the higher atmospheric pressure.",
    "More scientists and researchers are coming to the conclusion that some of this \"primary water\" is still breaking through to the surface as a result of earthquakes just as the Genesis account of the Flood explained how the entire world was once covered with water.",
    "Ezekiel 47:10-12 tells us: \"And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.",
    "They studied a single grain of material returned from asteroid Itokawa by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa in 2010 and found evidence that the asteroid had been irradiated by particles in the solar wind, turning a small amount of each dust grain into water.",
    "\"Of course, these same secularists and Bible skeptics say, as predicted in 2 Peter 3:3-6, that there never was a global flood on the Earth, even though it is still 70 percent covered in water, which averages more than two miles deep,\" writes Snelling.",
    "\"It's actually the confirmation that there is a very, very large amount of water that's trapped in a really distinct layer in the deep Earth,\" said Graham Pearson, lead author of the 2014 study and a geochemist at the University of Alberta in Canada.",
    "This suggests a different origin for the oceans: They seeped or exploded onto the surface in a cataclysmic event  not unlike the Flood, from the deep, where they believe there could be three times as much water as there is on the surface.",
    "\"For many years now, they have endeavored to fill in the difficult-to-explain pieces of their 'story' about how our home Earth 'just happened' to become so habitable for life over the course of its supposed billions-of-years history.",

    "With Mars now suspected of being home to \"significant amounts of water\"  deep underground  speculation is rife that Earth contains oceans undiscovered within the planet.",
    "\"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you,\" we're told in Ezekiel 47:25.",
    "And that is the literal fulfillment of what Christians call the New Covenant  which was prophesied in Jeremiah 31 long before it was mentioned in the Greek Scriptures.",
    "Still others contend that solar radiation played a key part in delivering water to Earth, solving a vexing mystery about where our planet's seas and oceans came from.",
    "There's more detail on the flow of these living waters provided in Ezekiel 47 as waters rush out from under the threshold of the Temple in Jerusalem toward the east.",

    "\"So the waters that came from inside the Earth, combined with the waters in the original, created oceans to produce the Genesis Flood.\"",
    "\"It translates into a very, very large mass of water, approaching the sort of mass of water that's present in all the world's oceans.\"",
