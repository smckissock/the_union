    "Christian Legal Centre chief Andrea Williams said, \"We are pleased that the government will face a judicial review on this crucial case for parents and primary school children across the country.\"",

    "The report said the Rowes in 2017 were the first parents to expose the impact transgender activism was having on primary school children.",
    "The couple, in a statement, said, \"We are delighted and relieved that after a four-year battle our crucial case will be heard.",
