    "Dressed in a crisp navy suit, Oz walked out from behind the curtain like he was about to tape an episode of “The Dr. Oz Show,” the daytime health and wellness TV program he hosted for more than a decade before ending it to run for office.",
    "The best thing I ever did in my life was to marry her 36 years ago,” Oz said, motioning for Lisa Oz, who was watching from near the curtain and dressed casually in jeans and sneakers, to come to the front of the room next to him.",
    "Early in their careers, the Ozes relocated to the New York City area (they’ve since acquired a mansion overlooking the Hudson River in New Jersey) so Mehmet Oz could pursue medicine and Lisa Oz could act in commercials.",

    "Christopher Dolan, The Times-Tribune/Associated Press\nAnd he wants to know what’s got your blood pressure rising — which, he emphasizes, rather seriously, can lead to heart attack or stroke.",
