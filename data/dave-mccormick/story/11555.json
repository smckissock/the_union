    "(CNN)Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is seeking the Republican nomination for US Senate in Pennsylvania, said Wednesday that he would renounce his Turkish citizenship if elected, after one of his top primary rivals questioned his allegiance to the United States.",
    "Oz's campaign, in turn, has tried to portray McCormick as as too cozy with China, citing statements McCormick made as a top Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration and his hedge fund's recent investments in China.",
    "Nonetheless, Republican primary rival David McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, has been attacking Oz over his dual citizenship, which Oz has said he retains in order to care for his mother in Turkey, a NATO member.",
    "Before Oz issued his statement, the McCormick campaign organized a press briefing Wednesday with Alaska GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan, who said it was \"inconceivable\" that a senator could forgo attending classified briefings.",
    "\"My understanding is, and I might be wrong, is that the issue has never been tested, that a dual citizen from another country, a Middle East country, would have to renounce,\" Sullivan said.",
    "Political commenter Kathy Barnette and Jeff Bartos, the 2018 GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, were at 9% each and former US Ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands was at 6%.",
    "\"The bigoted attacks my opponent Dave McCormick has made against me as the child of immigrants are reminiscent of slurs made in the past about Catholics and Jews,\" Oz said.",
    "On Tuesday, the website PoliticsPA reported that Oz had said he would keep his Turkish citizenship, even if it forced him to forgo security clearances as a senator.",
    "It is not the first time McCormick's campaign has tried to make an issue of the background of Oz, who was born in the United States to Turkish immigrant parents.",
    "The Oz campaign denies that the candidate said that but did not provide CNN with audio of the exchange, which took place during a news conference in Harrisburg.",
    "\"I maintained it to care for my ailing mother, but after several weeks of discussions with my family, I'm committing that before I am sworn in as the next U.S.",
    "There appears to be no requirement that elected members of Congress renounce their citizenship of other countries in order to attend classified briefings.",
    "When asked why a senator would have to renounce his dual citizenship to have the necessary security clearance, Sullivan said he was unsure.",
    "Jess Szymanski, a McCormick campaign spokesperson, asked last month how Oz could be \"America First\" when he had \"dual loyalties.\"",
    "Oz said in his statement Wednesday that McCormick's attacks were \"bigoted,\" \"desperate,\" \"disgraceful\" and \"disqualifying.\"",
    "A March 2-6 Fox survey of Republican primary voters in Pennsylvania found McCormick leading Oz by 9 points, 24% to 15%.",
    "\"My dual citizenship has become a distraction in this campaign,\" the former daytime TV personality said in a statement.",
    "Fox first reported that Oz planned to renounce his Turkish citizenship if elected to the Senate.",
    "\"It is a sign of McCormick's desperate campaign that he has resorted to this disgraceful tactic.",
    "It is completely disqualifying behavior for anyone aiming to serve in the United States Senate.\"",
    "\"My understanding is it's never been tested, and why should you even risk testing it?",
    "Nearly a third of voters were unsure which candidates they supported.",
    "I don't know where the intel community would come out on this.\"",
    "\"Voters can't trust Mehmet Oz,\" McCormick said on Twitter.",
    "Senator for Pennsylvania, I will only be a U.S.",
    "\"Renounce your Turkish citizenship now.\"",
    "citizen.\""
