    "He says he’s been fielding calls all day from unhappy conservatives asking what the hell was Trump thinking?”\n“President Trump was very out of sync in picking Oz,” Ball told the media outlet.”I’d like to know who it is who lives in Pennsylvania that knows the voters well, told Trump to pick Oz.”\nPLEASE JOIN OUR NEW COMMENT SYSTEM!",
    "— @MAGA1776 (@ricksta42251938) April 11, 2022\nThe answer did not actually answer the question, so Ingraham interrupted and reiterated what she just asked, “Was it a mistake, Kellyanne?”\nConway had a clear chance to praise McCormick at that point and tick off his qualifications, but that did not occur.",
    "I think that it confused many Republicans and conservatives in Pennsylvania because they’ve seen Oz in his own words on video about — against guns, for abortion, praising Hillary Clinton as one of the most brilliant women, smartest women he’s ever met, being for ObamaCare and so on and so forth.",
    "(Video Credit: Fox News)\nFox News host Laura Ingraham interviewed former Trump administration adviser Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday, taking aim at fellow Fox News host Sean Hannity’s and former President Donald Trump’s endorsement of Dr. Mehmet Oz for the US Senate in Pennsylvania.",
    "— Dennis R.White (@dennisrwhite1) April 11, 2022\nIngraham opened her show by focusing on those issues and making it clear she thought the endorsement was a bad idea after playing clips showing Oz’s controversial political stances.",
    "Ingraham was critical of the endorsement, calling it a “mistake.” She asked Conway, who endorsed Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania, if it was an error by Trump and Hannity to endorse Oz several times.",
    "Ingraham played clips on past statements by Oz concerning issues such as climate change, Red Flag laws for guns, and abortion… all of them leaning to the left.",
    "He went out and talked about trade policy, he took on China on your network every Monday morning for years,” Conway asserted, attempting to make her point.",
    "“Well, President Trump’s endorsement in these Republican primaries is a highly sought after and deeply consequential piece of political currency.",
    "“Hannity, I think, I believe endorsed Oz and I think that’s, you know, that’s probably not inconsequential for President Trump,” she remarked.",
    "— WPULLIAM (@WPULLIAM66) April 11, 2022\nDespite being friends with Hannity, Ingraham did not let him off the hook for his endorsement of Oz.",
    "The ‘Washington Examiner‘ spoke with bewildered voters and party leaders, including Washington County Republican Party Chair David Ball.",

    "“Do you think the Trump endorsement of Oz was a mistake?” Ingraham asked Conway putting her on the spot over the issue.",
    "Many conservatives are incensed by the support and don’t understand why Trump gave the nod to Oz instead of McCormick.",

    "It was obvious that Conway thought it was but she would not utter the word “mistake” on Trump’s part.",
    "We love hearing from our readers and invite you to join us for feedback and great conversation.",

    "Oz has the best chance of winning and it helps towards a conservative majority in PA politics.",
    "Donald Trump won not because he was a celebrity like Dr. Oz, he won because he did the work.",
    "She accused Oz of making “rookie mistakes” and not being anything like the former president.",
    "Not a snowballs chance in hell I’m voting for Mehmet Oz, an anti-2nd, Carpet bagging RHINO.",
