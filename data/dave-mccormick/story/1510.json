    "Jack Doyle, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said the Republican U.S. Senate primary is seeking to \"appeal to the most far-reaching extreme elements of the Republican base, which is very out of step from and very different from the voters who are going to decide this (general) election.\"",
    "Congressman Conor Lamb, who's running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate tweeted about the ad: \"Dave McCormick is too much of a coward to say 'Let's Go Brandon' himself, but pathetic enough to spend millions on a Super Bowl ad to say it for him.\"",
    "\"I think it's clear that McCormick's latest ad is a perfect example of what this campaign has become, which is an effort to suck up to Donald Trump while ignoring the issues that Pennsylvanians actually care about,\" Doyle said.",
    "Republican U.S. Senate primary candidate David McCormick's Super Bowl ad plays the repeating chant while showing news headlines about inflation, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, illegal border crossings and the trade deficit.",
    "McCormick's campaign tells Pittsburgh's Action News 4: \"There's a lot of frustration among Pennsylvanians -- including Dave -- about the policies of the Biden administration and where they're taking the country.",
    "It doesn't totally surprise me because in some respects we have the most unusual set of candidates running for the United States Senate in modern Pennsylvania history,\" Madonna told Pittsburgh's Action News 4.",
    "not only are they being attacked pretty severely in commercials, but they're trying to draw attention to themselves in a way that's unique.",
    "Nearly a half-minute of that chant makes up most of the audio of a political ad that aired locally during the Super Bowl on Sunday night.",
    "Terry Madonna, a Millersville University senior fellow for political affairs, said candidates are trying to stand out among others.",
    "The frustration and anger we are feeling toward the failures of our current leadership in Washington is what motivated me to run.\"",
    "In a written statement provided by his campaign, McCormick said: \"The issues we are facing are so much bigger than 'Brandon.'",
    "\"It was a bold move to try to boost his name recognition in this market and let's face it, we're talking about it today.\"",
    "Sam DeMarco, Allegheny County Republican Committee chair called the ad a \"way to try to boost his name recognition.\"",
    "It's based on a sports broadcaster's mishearing of a crowd chant in the background during a live event.",
    "PITTSBURGH —\n\"Let's Go Brandon\" is shorthand for a four-letter word insult — \"(Expletive) Joe Biden.\"",
    "\"I was surprised by it, then I thought about it and the context in which it took place.",
    "The only other spoken words in the ad are McCormick saying he endorses the message.",
    "Pittsburgh's Action News 4 talked with Republicans and Democrats about the ad.",
    "\"These are candidates that are trying to draw attention to themselves.",
    "\"I think it was a bold move on behalf of the McCormick campaign.",

    "I think it was an opportunity for him,\" DeMarco said.",
    "and this is McCormick's way of doing that.\"",
    "That's what the ad is about.\"",
    "I think it was a great ad."
