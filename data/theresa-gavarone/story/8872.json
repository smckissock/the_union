    "< < Back to\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (Statehouse News Bureau) — Throughout the past decade, various Republican Ohio lawmakers have backed bills to require voters to show their driver’s licenses or state-issued identification cards before casting ballots.",
    "He says it’s common for some voters who move often, change their name or let their license lapse without renewal to find they can’t vote under strict voter ID requirements.",
    "However, it would also no longer allow voters to use other proof of identity they can use now, such as paychecks or utility bills.",
    "One major sticking point in previous bills has been that voters cannot be required to spend money on an ID to cast a ballot.",
    "Marozzi says he would not have been able to vote recently because he had moved and hadn’t yet updated his driver’s license.",
    "And this is one step to make sure we are protecting and preserving the integrity of our election,” Gavarone says.",
    "And Collin Marozzi with the ACLU of Ohio says photo ID requirements can make it harder for registered voters.",
    "She says polls show widespread support for a law that requires voters to show these state-issued photo IDs.",
    "“Though people may think ‘I have a driver’s license so I’m ok,’ actually not,” Marozzi says.",
    "But Republican Sen. Theresa Gavarone (R-Bowling Green) hopes this time will be different.",
    "“A recent poll in 2021 showed that 80% of Americans support requiring a photo-id.",
    "There’s no evidence of significant voter fraud in Ohio or anywhere in the US.",
    "It’s a controversial idea that has lost steam in previous legislatures.",
    "But this bill would offer free state-issued IDs to anyone over 17.",
    "That’s the vast majority."
