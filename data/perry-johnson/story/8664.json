    "Prominent Michigan Democrats and Republicans alike have called the alleged signature forgery scheme one of the largest in Michigan's history and have criticized the GOP gubernatorial candidates for appearing to fail in exercising oversight over their contractors' signature-gathering operations to qualify for the ballot.",

    "In their opinion, Court of Appeals Judges Kristen Kelly, Michael Kelly and Noah Hood disagreed with the Johnson campaign's assertion that the Michigan Board of State Canvassers had an obligation to compare every signature submitted with the state's Qualified Voter File.",
    "\"Because Johnson bears the burden of demonstrating his entitlement to the requested writ ... we conclude that his failure to show that the act requested is ministerial and his failure to show a clear legal duty on the part of the Board are fatal to his claim.\"",
    "\"Likewise, because the Board had the discretion to not check each and every signature submitted by the fraudulent-petition circulators, the act Johnson is seeking to compel defendants to perform is not ministerial in nature.\"",
    "\"The Board (of State Canvassers), therefore, had a clear legal duty to investigate, but it did not have a clear legal duty to conduct a comparison of each fraudulent signature against the qualified voter file,\" judges wrote.",
    "They include Norton Shores businesswoman Tudor Dixon, Ottawa County real estate agent Ryan Kelley, Farmington Hills pastor Ralph Rebandt, Bloomfield Hills businessman Kevin Rinke and Kalamazoo chiropractor Garrett Soldano.",

    "Oakland County businessman and GOP gubernatorial hopeful Perry Johnson should not appear on the ballot for the upcoming August primary election, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday.",
    "\"We did not find a single registered voter with a matching signature for any of those circulators for any candidate of the ones we looked at,\" Brater said at last week's canvassers' meeting.",
    "Brater said that the Bureau of Elections carried out a targeted review of about 7,000 voter signatures on petition sheets from circulators who appeared to have forged voter signatures.",
    "Michigan elections director Jonathan Brater described the signature fraud identified by the Bureau of Elections an unprecedented \"attack on our election system\" at last week's meeting.",
    "Friday marks the deadline under state law to finalize the names of candidates for the primary election, and clerks must send out ballots to military and overseas voters on Jun.",
