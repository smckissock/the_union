    "“If there’s a theme,” Boyer told me, “either it’s unworkable, it’s unnecessary, it would detract from oversight in other aspects of government and if they all passed, they would be in conflict with one another and election officials couldn’t even actually do their jobs.”\nSo many solutions in search of a problem\nThere are, for example, bills that prevent early ballots from being counted before Election Day and bills that require all ballots to be counted by hand on Election Day, with the results being announced on election night.",

    "Which is not to be confused with a bill mandating that ballots be printed on what Boyer calls “magic paper” — paper that has 17 \"anti-fraud countermeasures\" and is only sold by one guy in Texas.",
    "Fortunately, there is one Republican who is declining to give in to the crazy, as his colleagues dream up literally 100 or more ways to solve election problems that don’t actually exit.",
    "But for the most part, our leaders are wasting precious time, hashing and rehashing dozens upon dozens of bills all aimed at eliminating voter fraud that thus far has not been found.",
    "The number of people living on the streets is up, our kids’ test scores are down and rent increases in the Valley are enough to pop your eyeballs clean out of their sockets.",
    "Senate President Karen Fann told The Arizona Republic’s Mary Jo Pitzl that the auditor general could find the money by simply auditing fewer government agencies every year.",
    "Meanwhile, the Arizona Legislature …\nContinues its quest to offer relief not to struggling Arizonans but to conspiracy theorists still obsessing about the 2020 election.",
    "“You want an audit every two years on something that’s not necessary, which would detract from audits of state government that actually are necessary,” Boyer told me.",
    "“It makes no sense, just to try to satisfy a particular part of the base that will never be satisfied, no matter what you do.”\nThere are a few decent election bills.",

    "The Republic’s Jessica Boehm has written story after heartbreaking story about the rise in homelessness, about seniors and veterans and families who need help.",
    "But I see little in the way of legislative brainpower employed to coming up with a sustained solution to the Valley’s crying need for more affordable housing.",
    "There are bills to ban drop boxes and bills to restrict drop boxes and one bill that would mandate the use of \"smart\" drop boxes that don’t actually exist.",
    "About the stunning rise of people setting up tarps and tents in parks and alleys and on sidewalks all across Phoenix, because they have no place to go.",
    "Naturally, there’s a bill to bar poll workers from handing out those Sharpie pens the conspiracy crowd is convinced stole votes from Donald Trump.",
    "Yet all our leaders can come up with in the way of a solution is Gov Doug Ducey’s offer of federal money to help fund existing summer camps.",
    "That would be in addition to the audits already mandated by state law, the ones that were always good enough until Trump lost.",
    "So many children have lost precious time in school and their academic performance has taken a painful pandemic-induced hit.",
