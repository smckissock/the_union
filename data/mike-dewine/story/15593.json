Terry Johnson (R-McDermott), who sponsored the bill.",
    "With spikes in violent crime, Sexton said Ohioans interested in owning a firearm and receiving firearm training is “at all time highs.”\n“People are genuinely and legitimately worried about their own safety and want to take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones,” Sexton said.",
    "“A person who lives, works and drives through areas that have recently exploded in violence should not have to complete government paperwork, submit to a background check, take a class, and then wait on the government to exercise a right guaranteed by the state of Ohio,” Sexton said.",

    "Instead, police officers would bear the burden of asking the person if they have a concealed weapon, to which the gun owner must answer truthfully — or be slapped with a second-degree misdemeanor.",
    "And with that increase, individuals who have not had any training have not been subject to a background check and can avoid a suspension or revocation by a sheriff,” Weinman said.",
    "Under the bill, Ohioans would no longer need to inform police officers with whom they are interacting that a concealed weapon is in their possession, according to the bill’s text.",
    "About 700,000 Ohioans have active concealed carry licenses, according to a February report from Attorney General Dave Yost’s office.",
    "“By essentially eliminating the CHL, the number of individuals carrying concealed handguns will undoubtedly increase.",
