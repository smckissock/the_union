    "“First, the Court should reserve judgment on any contempt finding for the time being, because despite the Commission’s inability to meet the Feb. 17 deadline (which some members noted was difficult if not impossible to meet as a matter of timing), the Commission is presently continuing its efforts to pass a compliant map.",

    "Republican members of the commission have asked the Ohio Supreme Court to hold off judgment on contempt of court charges while they continue to work on new maps.",
    "“My impression is there are also other members of the commission in the majority who haven’t been involved in those discussions,” Russo told Spectrum News.",
    "Republicans also argued the Democrats’ proposal was unconstitutional and members were unsure how closely a plan must be to strict proportionality.",
    "It is meeting today and again tomorrow, and a new plan could be approved in the coming days,” the motion read.",
    "The second set of maps showed 58.3% Republican-leaning legislative districts, above the court-ordered 54%.",
