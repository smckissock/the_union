    "When asked about his thoughts on Biden’s comments and whether that would help sell the bill on a bipartisan basis, Husted responded this way: “Anytime a president who is unpopular mentions something, it certainly does not necessarily help build broad-based support.",
    "Biden talked about the need for Congress to approve the \"Chips Act,\" legislation that would provide $52 billion for expansion of the Intel project, and other efforts to produce the semiconductor chips that are used in cars, phones, and other technology.",

    "President Biden mentioned the new Intel semiconductor processing facility in his State of the Union speech last night, urging bipartisan support from Congress for the legislation that would help that project grow.",
    "Husted says making semiconductor chips in the U.S. should be an issue of American security, ensuring the country isn’t dependent on other countries for this valuable resource.",
    "As he wove a story about Intel, the new project, and a federal bill that would provide support for semiconductor chip production, he quoted Democratic U.S.",
    "The U.S. House passed one version of it, and the Senate passed another, with both of Ohio’s Republican and Democratic Senators supporting the plan.",
    "That’s where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor mega-site,\" Biden said.",
    "Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) but didn’t talk about any of the Republican leaders who were instrumental in bringing the project to Ohio.",
    "President Biden drew attention to Intel’s planned semiconductor manufacturing facility in Ohio at Tuesday’s \"State of the Union\" speech.",
    "Husted says he favors the Senate plan, which doesn’t include $8 billion for climate change that Republicans opposed.",
    "While both versions of the bill include that funding, it has been stuck in political gridlock ever since.",
    "But I recognize that President Biden wants to connect himself to successful things that are happening.",
    "“If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus Ohio, you’ll find 1000 empty acres of land.",
    "We believe it is a bipartisan issue in the state of Ohio because it’s about jobs.",
    "It won’t look like much but if you look closely, you will see a field of dreams.",

    "In Ohio, though, we have not made it a partisan issue.",
    "And I don’t know who is not for that,\" Husted said.",
    "The ground on which America’s future will be built.",
