    "According to YLA’s website, students will “experience the process of state government by preparing and then presenting legislation in the actual House or Senate Chambers, make decisions to move Ohio and West Virginia forward, create connections with peers and adults from across our state, and have a great time with a purpose.",
    "The nine legislative students wrote and submitted bills individually or with partners, presented these bills to committees, and one student’s bill, created by Brooklyn Horner, passed the student House of Representatives.",
    "These youth representatives, with Amy LeCrone as their adviser, spent three days learning first-hand how state government works by participating in this student-led government simulation.",
