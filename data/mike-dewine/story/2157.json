    "However, even those who don’t see guns as the key issue should look at DeWine skeptically if that happens.",
    "Republicans in the House passed a near identical bill last year, rendering passage more likely than not.",
    "If DeWine signs the bill–assuming it passes, of course–then I’ll be happy to be wrong about the man.",
    "After all, what else will he say he’ll sign, only to change his mind when it comes across his desk.",
    "If you haven’t been able to tell I’m less than trusting when it comes to DeWine, well, I’m not.",
    "He was way too quick to push for gun control after the shooting in Dayton for my comfort.",

    "Whether DeWine supports this constitutional carry bill or not remains to be seen.",
    "There’s zero reason for any pro-gun voter to trust him to keep his word.",
    "So no, I didn’t expect much out of an Ohio constitutional carry push.",
    "But, he’s also a far cry from being Phil Murphy of New Jersey.",
    "The full House passed it in a 60-32 party line vote.",
    "The committee passed it in an 8-5 party line vote.",
    "It’s up for another hearing Wednesday.",
    "I’d like to take DeWine’s word for it.",
    "Yet, it seems I was mistaken.",

    "Mike DeWine."
