    "Mike DeWine, Auditor Keith Faber and Secretary of State Frank LaRose – also responded separately, saying they shouldn’t be individually liable because the panel “could not do in just ten days what it was previously unable to do in four months: adopt an Ohio General Assembly district plan that it, and this Court, will approve.”\nDuring a commission meeting Tuesday, Gov.",

    "Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) and Auditor Keith Faber (R-Ohio) revived talks to come up with a proposed state legislative district plan.",
    "But DeWine also noted that he would not be stepping away from the redistricting cases, though his father is a named defendant.",
    "Also responding separately are the panel’s two Democrats, co-chair Sen. Vernon Sykes and House Minority Leader Allison Russo.",
    "Instead, the commission rejected maps proposed by Democrats and adjourned, allowing the court’s deadline to expire.",
    "Speaker Bob Cupp and Senate President Matt Huffman responded about 20 minutes before the 12 noon deadline.",
