    "Millions are being spent through H2Ohio to build and expand wetlands, create a broader suite of payment incentives for farmers willing to use best available science to help reduce algae-forming runoff, and overhaul outdated water and sewer systems in some parts of Ohio, especially low-income areas at risk of contamination from lead water pipes and a lack of proper sewage.",
    "He also heard from Kate Lochridge, a BGSU junior from North Canton, Ohio, with a double major in studio art and biology, about how she dewatered some algae and used it as pigment for algae-based paint which appears in some artwork used to explain the causes, effects, and impacts of blooms through artwork.",
    "BGSU President Rodney Rogers told The Blade the university was “honored to have the governor” visit its campus and learn more about western Lake Erie research it is doing in collaboration with other public universities, such as the University of Toledo, Heidelberg University, and Ohio State University.",
    "During his briefing with reporters, Mr. DeWine said his H2Ohio program is innovative because he secured the Ohio General Assembly’s trust in going big on a statewide water quality improvement program that had never been done to that degree and will take years to achieve its intended results.",
    "Mike DeWine made Bowling Green State University’s campus his first of three northwest Ohio stops Tuesday, meeting with students, faculty, and administrators to discuss goals of his H2Ohio program and learn about research projects to help improve western Lake Erie water quality.",
    "From there, the governor went to a table with a diorama of a farm field, one in which Angélica Vázquez-Ortega, an assistant BGSU professor of geochemistry, and her students had Mr. DeWine spray water from a squirt bottle to replicate the hydrology of runoff following storms.",
    "It’s the closest thing to real-time information and will be particularly useful to water-treatment plant operators once commercialized, possibly this fall, George Bullerjahn, professor and director of BGSU’s Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health, said.",
    "Mr. DeWine, who wore a BGSU tie to the event, said he was particularly pleased to meet two out-of-state students, Kate Brown, of Buffalo, and Kate Barker, of West Virginia, after both said they were drawn to BGSU for its water quality programs.",
    "Mr. DeWine said that he is hopeful that H2Ohio will complement whatever ultimate cleanup strategy comes out of that court-approved consent decree, even though the plaintiffs have said that voluntary incentives aren’t going far enough.",
    "According to a recent U.S. District Court filing, a landmark Lake Erie case has been settled in principle and is headed for a court-ordered consent decree which could change or cut into the incentive-laden aspect of H2Ohio.",
    "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.”\nThe governor said one of Ohio’s greatest advantages is “an abundance of water” and said the state has “a moral obligation to take care of that water.”",
    "Shortly upon his arrival, Governor DeWine participated in a demonstration that shows how newly emerging technology can be used to detect algal toxins in water samples in as few as 10 minutes.",
    "It’s what you do year after year after year.”\nBut H2Ohio’s future is at a crossroads less than four years after it began, and not just because Mr. DeWine is up for re-election this fall.",
    "After that, Mr. DeWine went to a table where it was explained how efforts under way to harvest potentially useful matter from algal blooms for commercial use.",
    "I would hope that there would not be a conflict between the settlement and what we are doing,” Mr. DeWine said.",
    "“In the last few years, we’ve made the biggest investment in the history of Ohio for water,” Mr. DeWine said.",
    "We're going to continue to invest and put money into this [H2Ohio] project.",
    "Everyone has the goal of [wanting] the algae bloom to start going away.",
    "We think it's going to end up with good results,” Mr. DeWine said.",
    "I think we all have to kind of watch this to see how it works out.",
    "H2Ohio’s future will come down to how well it works, he said.",
    "Everyone has the goal of clean water.",
    "“Look, we all have the same goal.",
    "“We all want instant results.",
    "“We think it's working well.",
    "“But, frankly, no one knows.",
    "BOWLING GREEN — Gov.",
    "It’s not instant."
