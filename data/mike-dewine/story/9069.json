    "He thinks it is not fair due to politicians being on the Commission, but also added the system directly negatively impacts the growing number of Independents in the state.",
    "When striking down the third proposed maps, the Court said that the Republicans went too far to skew the maps in favor of their party, their 74-page document showed.",
    "Although Wiggins Jr. is involved with some Ohio nonpartisan nonprofits, like Rank the Vote Ohio, he reached out to News 5 as an independent concerned citizen.",
    "But if the Supreme Court accepted this so-called 'Independent State Legislature Doctrine,' then the idea of independent commissions would be impermissible.\"",

    "\"No matter how you do it, somebody is going to be unhappy precisely because the political stakes are so high,\" Entin said.",
    "\"We had that with the amendments for the legislative districts and the congressional districts leading up to this cycle.\"",
    "Even if an amendment is proposed, it probably wouldn’t be able to take effect until after the 2030 census, Entin added.",
    "The high court responded and ordered the entire Commission to file a response, if any, by 9 a.m. Wednesday, March 23.",
    "\"Now that's not a majority of the Court, but if a majority of the Court went down that path, then all bets are off.",

    "However, the Ohio Supreme Court cites Huffman and Cupp as the leaders.",
    "Until then, he hopes the commission will find a way to work together.",
