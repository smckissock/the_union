    "If 45 states are not participating in core tech development, that means they are disenfranchised and marginalized.”\nWhy Ohio stands out\nAlthough the United States’ current chip plants are largely concentrated in the Southwest, Ohio’s access to water (a necessary resource for semiconductor production) and the region’s concentration of top-rated engineering schools, could make Ohio the center of what Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger envisions as a future “Silicon Heartland.” That’s a far more hopeful label than the long?-?standing – and many say unfair?ly backward looking?",
    "“It won’t look like much,” President Joe Biden confessed in his State of the Union address in March, “but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a ‘field of dreams,’ the ground on which America’s future will be built.”\nLater this year, Intel, one of the world’s largest tech companies, plans to break ground on two new semiconductor fabrication plants on this 1,000-acre plot of land in New Albany, Ohio – a $20 billion investment that could create 3,000 jobs.",

    "... We have to get back to being manufacturing independent.”\nIt’s a concept Mr. Cummins is thinking about, both at his company (which has evolved from metal-finishing roots to a focus on producing hinges) and in his sideline work helping to create the one-room North Central Ohio Industrial Museum in Mansfield.",
    "“A lot of people think that all we need to be [in the U.S.] is a service industry and I don’t agree with that,” says Mayor Hill from his office in Lordstown, where a blanket hangs on the wall that pictures every model of car that was made at GM’s Lordstown plant over its 53 years.",
    "We can make different choices, and I’m glad that at least in this one case we are.”\n“Don’t ... take your eye off the ball”\nJust 150 miles northeast of the barren New Albany fields, grass breaks through concrete parking lots in front of empty warehouses the size of football fields.",
