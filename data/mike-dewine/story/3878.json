    "\"What I will say is this: A semiconductor plant of this size requires a really good site location with many aspects of readiness, access to water, access to utility infrastructure, and all those kinds of things.\"",
    "\"Our opportunity here is to make sure that we support the companies that are here and want access to that and find more people who have the ability to take advantage,\" Koehler told 3News.",

    "While Cleveland didn’t get the Intel factory, which the company says could end up as large as four football fields, there are a lot of pros for our area.",
    "Koehler says Northeast Ohio needs to focus on having those things and having them prepared at multiple locations for companies looking for new homes.",
    "Another opportunity for Northeast Ohio comes in the form of higher education and all the colleges and universities in the area that could benefit.",
    "\"Those institutions will be viewed as a place where students want to go and attend that will look at Intel as an employer of choice,\" Koehler.",
