    "\"Impossibility is a total defense here, not only because the governor cannot unilaterally issue new redistricting maps or dictate the commission’s decisions, but also because the expert-drawn maps were never completed with the required time frame despite their best efforts,\" according to DeWine's court filing.",
    "Those suing over Ohio's legislative maps want members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission – or at least the four Republicans who voted for maps last week – held in contempt of court for ignoring the Ohio Supreme Court's order to complete constitutional maps.",
    "\"It is undisputed that the independent map drawers ran out of time to draw a map 'from scratch' that met the requirements of this Court’s order and the Ohio Constitution,\" wrote attorneys for Huffman and Speaker Bob Cupp, R-Lima.",
    "Attorneys for several Republicans also argued that holding members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission in contempt would violate the separation of powers between the judicial and executive or legislative branches.",
    "\"Dr. (Michael) McDonald and I made every effort as we were drawing the maps to follow those requirements, but I did not have time to conduct the detailed review to confirm whether that is the case,\" Johnson wrote.",
    "Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, in a filing, argued he shouldn't be held in contempt of court because he did his duty as a commission member: He cast a vote for maps based on the options he had at the time.",
    "Democrats on the commission – House Minority Leader Allison Russo, of Upper Arlington, and Sen. Vernon Sykes, of Akron – asked the group to approve the hired mapmakers' plan instead, saying it was finished.",
    "Jessie Balmert is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Akron Beacon Journal, Cincinnati Enquirer, Columbus Dispatch and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.",
    "Meanwhile, the commission's Democrats, Russo and Sykes, asked the Ohio Supreme Court to strike down the fourth maps and have the commission approve ones crafted by the hired mapmakers instead.",
    "In an affidavit, one of the hired mapmakers, National Demographics Corporation's Douglas Johnson, says he didn't have time to check that his work complied with the Ohio Constitution.",
    "Republicans who approved Ohio's latest state House and Senate maps argued they ditched hired mapmakers' plans because they weren't finished and likely violated the Ohio Constitution.",
    "LaRose was recently recorded telling Republicans that he \"certainly wouldn't oppose\" the impeachment of Ohio Supreme Court Justice Maureen O'Connor over her redistricting decisions.",
    "LaRose said she “violated her oath of office by making up what she wants the law to say instead of interpreting what it actually says,\" the Ohio Capital Journal first reported.",
    "On the final day of mapmaking, Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, pitched this solution as a \"failsafe\" if two mapmakers hired by the commission didn't complete their work.",
    "Without the Ohio Supreme Court's swift intervention, it's likely that a panel of federal judges will pick maps on April 20 – the last possible date to hit an Aug. 2 primary.",
    "They also took issue with the \"independent\" maps including districts drawn by Democratic redistricting consultant Chris Glassburn without GOP members' approval.",
    "The maps would give the GOP a 54-45 advantage in the House and an 18-15 advantage in the Senate – in line with Ohioans' voting preferences.",
    "Maps approved late last week were nearly identical to House and Senate districts rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court's 4-3 majority.",
    "(Republican Auditor Keith Faber opposed the plans because they contained too many splits and districts that were not compact.)",
    "The adjustments also reduced the number of highly competitive Democratic districts to 17 in the House and six in the Senate.",
    "Faber, who voted against the maps, said that trying to hold members in contempt of court was a \"frivolous\" action.",
    "\"Only after that became clear did the Commission adopt the 'failsafe' plan that complies with the Constitution.",
    "\"They were filed not based upon merit, but to obviously harass the Commission and its individual members.\"",
    "In the end, those maps were the ones approved by four GOP members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission.",
    "Mike DeWine argued he couldn't be held responsible for failing to achieve an impossible task.",
    "Republicans, in court filings, vehemently disagreed that the hired mapmakers' plan was done.",
    "Get more political analysis by listening to the Ohio Politics Explained podcast",
    "Only a good faith effort to comply with this Court’s orders.\"",
    "But that failed along party lines.",
