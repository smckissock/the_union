    "State Sen. Vernon Sykes, an Akron Democrat and commission member, said: “We could have avoided the troubles we are now facing with the primary election if we had simply adopted fair, constitutional maps to begin with.”\nSykes said Thursday that he urged the members to “work together in a bipartisan, transparent manner to deliver the fair, constitutional maps Ohioans have demanded.”\nHouse Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington and a commission member, said: “For the third time, the Supreme Court has ruled the majority party is not above the law and cannot blatantly disregard the will of Ohio voters and the Ohio Constitution.",

    "Now the Legislature will have to choose between a later primary or having one on May 3 for all other candidates besides those running for state legislative seats — and almost certainly for the U.S. House as that map is being challenged in the state’s high court over gerrymandering issues — or postponing it.",
    "“To promote transparency and increase public trust, the drafting should occur in public and the commissioners should convene frequent meetings to demonstrate their bipartisan efforts to reach a constitutional plan within the time set by the court,” the decision read.",
    "UNCONSTITUTIONAL\nMAPS\nThe court’s majority — which includes the three Democratic justices and Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, a Republican — ruled the third set of legislative maps unconstitutional because they disproportionately favored Republicans.",
    "“When the 26 so-called Democratic-leaning districts in that range are excluded, the second revised plan has 72 Republican districts and 34 Democratic districts for a total of 106 nonexcluded districts,” the court’s decision read.",
    "“This gives Republicans a 67.9 percent share of the nonexcluded districts (72 out of 106) and Democrats 32.1 percent (34 out of 106).”\nThe decision also said: “The existence of competitive districts is not inherently problematic.",
    "The gross and unnecessary disparity in the allocation of close districts is what offends.”\nThe court ordered the commission to draw and approve a fourth set of maps by March 28 and submit it to the court a day later.",
    "Mike DeWine, a Republican commission member, said Thursday he wants the two Republican map-drawers to work with the one hired by Democrats to come up with maps that follow the court’s decision and are constitutional.",
    "Before the Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision late Wednesday to reject the Ohio Redistricting Commission’s state legislative maps for a third time, legislative Democrats had sought to postpone the primary until late June.",
    "RESPONSES\nAlso, DeWine, who has let House Speaker Bob Cupp and Senate President Matt Huffman, both Lima Republicans and commission members, make the key moves regarding the map, said that will stop.",

    "I don’t foresee how we do a full May 3 primary.”\nStephanie Penrose, Trumbull County Board of Elections director, said: “Nothing is official, but it’s not possible.",
    "“The commission has again adopted a plan in which a disproportionate number of toss-up districts are labeled Democratic-leaning,” the court’s decision read.",
    "The court’s majority also recommended the commission retain an independent map-drawer rather than retain the two selected by the Republicans to do the work.",
    "But 26 of the districts were drawn to favor Democrats by no more than 3 percent and all of the Republican districts favor that party by at least 5 percent.",
    "Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican member of the redistricting commission, has said having two primaries would cost $20 million to $25 million.",
    "“We’ve been dragging our feet on printing in anticipation of the rejection of the maps,” said Penrose, who added she wasn’t surprised by the court ruling.",
    "Democrats have a state legislative map proposed ready to go that is fair, constitutional and closely reflects the statewide voting preferences of Ohioans.",

    "There isn’t enough time under the court’s schedule to hire an outside mapmaker, DeWine said.",
    "“Whatever our personal opinions are about a decision is irrelevant frankly,” he said.",

    "“They can either move everything back or do a split primary.",
    "Republican legislators refused to change the date.",
