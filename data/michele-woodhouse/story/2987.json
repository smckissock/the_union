    "They enjoy his combative tongue-lashing of GOP leaders and other Republicans he brands too establishment.? But in North Carolina, GOP insiders say Cawthorn's efforts to play kingmaker and constant threats to campaign against fellow Republicans he deems insufficiently conservative, combined with a litany of personal foibles, are beginning to turn figures across the party against him.",

Richard Hudson, the House Republican Conference secretary, an elected leadership position; and ninth-term Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee and former chief deputy majority whip.",
    "When the map fell through, Cawthorn went back to a newly configured 11th District and moved to muscle out Michele Woodhouse, the Republican he had endorsed to take his place in the state's far-western district and personally encouraged to run (Woodhouse has refused to stand down and is among Cawthorn's primary opponents).",
    "In his own state, the Republicans with whom Cawthorn serves are smarting from his aborted attempt to switch districts in the wake of decennial reapportionment and his half-baked hubristic campaign to anoint the GOP nominee in 11 of North Carolina's 14 newly configured House seats.",

    "But Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and North Carolina native, questioned whether the congressman would fall out of favor with Republican voters in his district, given the premium the GOP base puts on combativeness and loyalty to Trump.",
    "In that primary, Cawthorn defeated the candidate hand-picked by Meadows and endorsed by Trump, but the ambitious Republican quickly embraced the 45th president and affiliated with his wing of the GOP.",
    "Meanwhile, Cawthorn had created a document based on that initial map titled Cawthorn's Plan for North Carolina.?\nIn it, the congressman laid out which districts he wanted incumbent Republicans to run.",
