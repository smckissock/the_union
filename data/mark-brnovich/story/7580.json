    "Richer says of Brnovich’s report, “But most importantly, it, rightfully, doesn’t say anything about a stolen election or unlawful acts by election workers … .”\nAnd, he adds, “All of this seems appropriate as it’s coming from the man who (rightfully) laughed off notions of a stolen election on Fox News that people simply split their ticket (which is how we still have a Republican legislature).”\nArizona judge rules that 'law enforcement' is NOT a profession If the Constitution means anything, kick Rep. Gosar off the ballot Does Ducey really think cops in Alaska can help secure our border?",
    "And in a report handed over to Arizona Senate President Karen Fann – who orchestrated the ongoing Cyber Ninjas audit disaster – Brnovich reports that his investigation revealed “serious vulnerabilities.”\nActually, what it seems to have revealed is serious political BS on the part of Brnovich.",
    "He was just AG then, not a U.S. Senate candidate\nBut, that was Brnovich when he still was acting like an actual attorney general and before he decided to use his elected office almost exclusively to promote his campaign for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate.",
    "County recorder speaks truth about Brnovich's probe\nBut, as Richer points out in his tweet thread concerning Brnovich’s probe:\n“I remember spending many, many hours working with investigators on our entire tech stack.",
    "Richer and the county’s Republican-controlled board of supervisors have responded, and responded, and responded to claims of fraud\nNever finding a serious problem after multiple independent reviews.",
    "Shortly after the 2020 presidential election Attorney General Mark Brnovich appeared on Fox Business, where he was asked about unsubstantiated claims of election fraud in Arizona.",
    "Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer (a Republican who gained office in that 2020 election) responded with a quick Twitter answer to Brnovich’s claims.",
    "That led to Brnovich having his investigators conduct their own investigation of what is probably the most investigated election … anywhere … ever.",
    "Richer goes on to explain or debunk what Brnovich’s minions came up with and ends his Twitter thread response with the most important point.",
    "He said at the time, “if indeed there was some great conspiracy” to steal votes from fellow Republicans, “it apparently didn’t work.”\nTrue.",
    "There is no evidence, there are no facts that would lead anyone to believe that the election results will change.”\nTrue as well.",
    "Back when he was acting like an actual attorney general rather than treating his elected office like a campaign headquarters.",
    "He added, “In Arizona, there was a prediction that the (Republican-controlled) Legislature would flip.",
    "Brnovich needed to please Republicans who refuse to accept the truth about the election.",
    "The county recorder here who oversees elections went from Democrat to Republican.",
    "There were some congressional districts that supposedly leaned Democrat.",
    "Looking at questions like internet connectivity and data deletion.",
    "I guess the answers to those don’t fit the narrative … .”\nExactly.",
    "The county attorney remained Republican.”\nAlso true.",

    "That is exactly what Brnovich did in 2020.",
    "Brnovich continued, “That’s the reality.",
    "He had to throw them some kind of bone.",
    "They didn’t flip.",
    "It didn’t.",
    "Yes."
