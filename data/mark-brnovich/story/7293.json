    "Not only that, but Arizona has allowed charter school owners to use taxpayer money to strike deals and become wealthy in ways that would send officials in a standard school district to prison.",
    "In 1994, when the idea for charter schools was pitched to the Legislature, the discussion focused on niche schools that would fill gaps or expand programs offered by traditional schools.",
    "This seemingly insatiable avarice, as well as an ongoing war on public school teachers, has kept Arizona near the very bottom among states when it comes to spending per pupil.",
