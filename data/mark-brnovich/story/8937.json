    "The guidance, along with other rules put in place in the last year, led DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to declare that the administration has \"fundamentally changed immigration enforcement in the interior.\"",
    "Those rules, made permanent in September, narrowed ICE's focus to three categories of illegal immigrants for arrest and deportation: recent border crossers, \"aggravated felons\" and national security threats.",
    "The Republican states had argued that the guidance violated immigration laws passed by Congress and that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by not engaging in notice-and-comment rule making.",
    "\"The States sue because they believe DHS skirting Congress’ immigration enforcement mandates when it issued a policy that prioritizes certain high-risk noncitizens for apprehension and removal.",
    "The guidance in September also expanded the number of mitigating factors that were to be considered before ICE officials could commence enforcement proceedings against an illegal immigrant.",
    "Attorneys General from Arizona, Ohio and Montana had sued the administration over its guidance for ICE agents that it first published shortly after entering office last year.",
    "\"At bottom, this is what this dispute is about: can the Executive displace clear congressional command in the name of resource allocation and enforcement goals?",

    "Of the arrests, 32% were immigrants who had been encountered by Border Patrol and issued Notices to Report to ICE.",
    "Stephen Miller, head of America First Legal -- which backed the lawsuit -- called it a \"colossal win.\"",
    "The administration has claimed it allows agents to focus limited resources on top priority threats.",
    "It is the latest legal defeat suffered by the Biden administration on the subject of immigration.",
    "He had also expressed agreement with the claims made by the states about increased costs to them.",
    "\"When DHS pulls back immigration enforcement, the States pick up some of the cost,\" he wrote.",
