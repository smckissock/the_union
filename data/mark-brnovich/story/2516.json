    "Cue his resolution: “Whereas, a declaration of the results of statewide electoral contests in the 2020 general election is in dispute with probable cause to believe that multiple discrepancies exist, both criminal and noncriminal in nature, and that so many questionable ballots were commingled with legitimate ballots across the State of Arizona that significant voter disenfranchisement has occurred, making the election irredeemably compromised … .”\nArizona judge rules that 'law enforcement' is NOT a profession If the Constitution means anything, kick Rep. Gosar off the ballot Does Ducey really think cops in Alaska can help secure our border?",
    "“It is the justifiable position of the Arizona State Legislature,” it declares, “that we set aside the results of the Maricopa, Pima and Yuma County elections as irredeemably compromised and reclaim the 2020 Presidential Electors due to the irredeemably flawed nature of these elections that prevent the declaration of a clear winner of said presidential electors.”\nActually, we do have a clear winner and a clear set of sore losers, consisting chiefly of ambitious politicians looking to assemble power – and campaign donations.",
    "Finchem is joined in his resolution by the usual conspiracy buffs: Reps. Brenda Barton of Payson, Leo Biasiucci of Lake Havasu City, Judy Burges of Skull Valley, Neal Carter of Queen Creek, Joseph Chaplik of Scottsdale, Lupe Diaz of Benson,\nJohn Fillmore of Apache Junction, Teresa Martinez of Casa Grande, Quang Nguyen of Prescott Valley and Jacqueline Parker of Mesa.",
    "Republican Rep. Mark Finchem’s House Concurrent Resolution 2033 reads like a seven-page laundry list of imagined grievances and debunked conspiracy theories, topped off by a fantasy belief that the Arizona Legislature somehow has the power to decertify the results of the election in Maricopa, Pima and Yuma counties and recall the state’s 2020 presidential electors.",
    "“Evidence and testimony collected since November 3, 2020, has reached the point of clear and convincing and is now in the hands of the Arizona Attorney General for action.”\nThe only thing clear and convincing is the fact that Attorney General Mark Brnovich is under tremendous pressure to indict someone (anyone?)",
    "Using this lie for votes and cash\nThe only irredeemable thing that I see here is Finchem and the other ambitious politicians who continue to promote the lie that Arizona’s vote was stolen in order to hit up loyal Republicans for money and votes in an opportunistic attempt to move up the political food chain.",
    "In his resolution, this Oro Valley Republican rehashes many of the old conspiracy theories about how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen, conveniently omitting the fact that the Senate’s own audit of Maricopa County’s results found no widespread evidence of fraud.",
    "It goes on, with another 51 whereases, including a laughable claim that that all-day Trump infomercial he convened at a downtown Phoenix hotel on Nov. 30, 2020 – what he calls “an ad hoc public fact-finding hearing” – produced actual evidence of a conspiracy.",
    "“We determined that nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws,” the county concluded, after a three-month study of the audit’s findings.",
    "Bowers should give Finchem’s resolution the same tender loving care that he dispensed last week to Rep. John Fillmore’s bold bill to allow the Legislature to overturn the results of any future election its august members don’t like.",
    "Finchem claims the election is 'irredeemable'\n“The questions first raised over a year ago about the legitimacy of the 2020 General Election persist,” Finchem says, in a press release sent out on Monday by House Republicans.",
    "He also conveniently dismissed the fact that the Republican-run county in January issued a convincing 93-page report laying waste to 76 of the 77 claims made by the Senate’s Cyber Ninja auditors in their September report.",
    "Comes now the latest attempt to overthrow Arizona’s vote in the 2020 presidential election, brought to us by a guy who is actually hoping we will put him in charge of the state’s future elections.",
    "Including a not-so-laughable claim that the Legislature has the constitutionally conferred power to disregard state law and overthrow the will of the people in an election held 15 months ago.",
    "Finchem’s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves,\" Bowers said, in a statement issued late Monday.",
    "Opinion: Rep. Mark Finchem's proposal to decertify Arizona's 2020 presidential election should be dispatched to oblivion, as should his future political prospects.",
    "Lawmakers don't have the power he thinks\nWhich matters not at all to Finchem who shamelessly continues to claim that the election was stolen.",
    "Not the phony electors put forth by the state GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward and what could be her fellow co-conspirators.",
    "Count House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, among those who find Finchem's bill ridiculous, or worse.",
    "Sonny Borrelli of Lake Havasu City, Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff and Kelly Townsend of Mesa.",
    "Big News in Arizona!”\nAlong with it came a button to donate to Trump’s Save America PAC.",
    "Or that Trump, within hours of Finchem's resolution being introduced, announced: “Rep.",
    "Bowers assigned that one to all 12 standing committees – and political oblivion.",
    "FInchem Introduces Resolution to Decertify Three Arizona 2020 County Elections.",
    "Let’s get to Finchem’s resolution, which proclaims the election irredeemable.",
    "in order to avoid the wrath of Trump as he campaigns for the Senate.",
    "That’s a destination that voters should keep in mind for Fiinchem.",
    "Did I mention that Finchem is running for secretary of state?",
    "Support local journalism: Subscribe to azcentral.com today.",
    "Or that he’s been endorsed by Donald Trump?",

    "Trump agreed (and won't you donate?)",
    "Which, of course, means none.",
    "(And won’t you donate?)",
    "What's 'irredeemable'?",
    "The real ones, I mean.",
