    "The Georgia Elections Board granted subpoena power to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Monday to secure evidence into possible illegal ballot harvesting in the 2020 election.In January, Raffensperger announced he would probe a complaint submitted in November by True the Vote, which details digital data of 242 people making visits to drop boxes to dump mail-in ballots.The complaint says about 40 percent of the trips occurred between midnight and 5:00 a.m., an unusual time to drop off ballots.",
    "The probe is also looking into whether participants in the scheme were paid $10 for each ballot they dropped in the unsecure dropbox."
