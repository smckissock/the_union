    "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading lawmaker calling for $50,000 in student-debt forgiveness for every federal borrower, told Teen Vogue in an interview that compounding interest on student loans can trap borrowers into paying off more debt than they originally borrowed, keeping them in \"repayment forever,\" and student-loan companies aren't much help when borrowers find themselves in a bind.",
    "And while student-loan payments have been on pause for nearly two years, many borrowers still have substantial student debt loads they are worried about paying off on May 1, which is why Warren and some of her Democratic colleagues are calling for not only the student-loan industry to be reformed, but for Biden to cancel student debt altogether.",
    "Interest rates on student loans increased in July, with the rates for undergraduate loans at 3.73%, rates for graduates and professionals at 5.28%, and rates for PLUS loans for parents and graduate students at 6.28%, and if borrowers fall behind on their payments, the interest doesn't stop growing.",
    "Most recently, for example, Navient  one of the largest companies  reached a $1.85 billion settlement over \"widespread unfair, deceptive, and abusive student loan servicing practices and abuses in originating predatory student loans,\" according to 39 attorneys general.",
    "Warren has long held the student debt crisis in her sights, and along with pushing for student-loan forgiveness, she has frequently called out abusive practices by student-loan companies.",

    "Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\nSen. Elizabeth Warren told Teen Vogue high interest rates on student debt can keep people in \"repayment forever.\"",
    "\"We've [also] had student loan debt servicers who didn't work to try to get people into the right repayment plans,\" Warren said.",
    "As Insider has previously reported, interest rates on student loans are a primary contributor to the growing student debt load.",

    "\"They can't sign a contract, do a lousy job, cost borrowers tons of money, and still get their contracts renewed.\"",
    "She also told Insider in a July interview that \"the days are over\" when loan companies \"could do a terrible job.\"",
    "And if that meant that the student's debt compounded and became unpayable, the servicing company didn't care.",
