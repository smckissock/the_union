    "News of her filing for re-election in 2024  a formality most senators will complete years in advance in order to keep their campaign operations running  was met with raised eyebrows, as she'd be 91 years old when she made another run for Senate in 2024.",
    "\"A new generation has been building for some time and I would be very excited to see that bench come out,\" said Ada Briceo, chair of the Orange County Democrats, who acknowledged that Feinstein had \"been leading for a long period of time in California.\"",
    "Among California's Democratic establishment, Feinstein's age and longevity is a difficult subject given legitimate concerns about ageism and her lengthy career in the state; a former mayor of San Francisco, she's been in the Senate since 1992.",
