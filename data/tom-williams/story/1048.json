    "On Tuesday afternoon, the CDC said it was updating its booster shot recommendations to allow:\npeople over 50 with underlying medical conditions that increase their COVID risk\nand everyone over 65\nto get a 4th dose of an mRNA vaccine, from either Pfizer or Moderna, at least four months after their first boost.",

    "\"This is especially important for those 65 and older and those 50 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for severe disease from COVID-19, as they are the most likely to benefit from receiving an additional booster dose at this time.\"",
    "We need more forward-thinking vaccines\nExperts stress that even in these highly vulnerable populations, additional boosters with the exact same vaccine recipes we've had all along can only be a short-term virus-fighting strategy.",
    "\"Boosters are safe, and people over the age of 50 can now get an additional booster four months after their prior dose to increase their protection further,\" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.",
    "Research suggests boosters are not as useful at this juncture for younger people, whose immune systems respond better to vaccines of all kinds, and therefore need less frequent boosting in general.",
    "5th shot boosts are allowed now for immunocompromised patients\nIn addition to the extra shots for older adults, the CDC is also allowing more booster doses for immunocompromised patients.",
    "(Adults who received a primary vaccine and booster dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine at least four months ago can also get a second booster, but only with Pfizer or Moderna product.)",

    "This guidance pertains to patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or have other medical conditions of an \"equivalent level of immunocompromise.\"",
    "In the long run, better vaccines, tailored to variants, or that protect against multiple viral strains at the same time, need to be part of the solution.",
    "A fifth shot is now on offer for:\nimmunocompromised patients over 12, with Pfizer's vaccine\nimmunocompromised patients over 18, with Moderna's.",
    "(Immunocompromised patients who got J&J can now have a total of four shots, but the boosts should all be Pfizer or Moderna product.)",
    "Because when you look at the data of what boosters do, particularly in the era of Omicron, boosters are extremely important.\"",

    "The CDC said people over 50 with underlying medical conditions, and everyone over 65, may get a second boost.",
    "The second boosts can be given with Moderna or Pfizer's vaccine, at least four months after a first booster.",
