    "After Manchin told Fox he couldn't vote for the Build Back Better bill, Goldman Sachs cut next year's growth forecast; UMWA President Cecil Roberts put out a statement urging Manchin to revisit his opposition to [Build Back Better].? Roberts specifically pointed to provisions in the bill that extend an expiring fee mandated of coal companies to compensate miners suffering from black lung disease, encourage businesses to build manufacturing facilities for miners who have lost their jobs, and penalize companies that deny workers the right to unionize.",
    "In West Virginia, they don't even try to hide the pro-fossil-fuel bias: One of the three members of the Public Service Commission is Bill Raney, the former head of the West Virginia Coal Association, and well-known as one of the most powerful pro-coal lobbyists in the U.S. The job of the PSC is to make sure that customers are getting the lowest power rates they can from electric-power utilities,? says James Van Nostrand, director of the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at the West Virginia University College of Law.",
    "He's had a long romance with climate-denying coal barons and the CEOs of companies like American Electric Power and ExxonMobil (in a much-publicized Zoom meeting secretly recorded by climate activists posing as recruiters looking to hire lobbyists, a senior Exxon-Mobil lobbyist claimed that he talked to Manchin's office every week, calling the senator a kingmaker?), all of whom have billions of dollars invested in fossil-fuel infrastructure that is rapidly losing value.",
    "More to the point, his wealth has been accumulated through controversial coal-related businesses in his home state, including using his political muscle to keep open the dirtiest coal plant in West Virginia, which paid him nearly $5 million over the past decade in fees for coal handling, as well as costing West Virginia electricity consumers tens of millions of dollars in higher electricity rates (more about the details of this in a moment).",
    "My friends and I have a joke about his kind: They'd mine their momma's grave for a buck.?\nSo it was no surprise to Gunnoe that during an appearance on Fox News a week before Christmas, Manchin knifed President Biden's first-term agenda by announcing that he could not support the $1.8 trillion Build Back Better Act: I have tried everything I know to do? to support this, he told Fox host Bret Baier.",
    "But in West Virginia, the PSC basically sees it as their job to protect the coal industry at any cost.?\nOne you-gotta-be-fucking-kidding-me example: In 2021, as the result of expert testimony from the Sierra Club, the West Virginia PSC considered whether the three big West Virginia coal plants, including John Amos, should be shut down as planned in 2028 or keep them running until 2040.",
    "She points to Manchin's ties with the pharmaceutical industry, including the fact that Mylan Inc.  which manufactured opiates, as well as other drugs  where Manchin's daughter was CEO from 2012 to 2020, was one of the largest campaign contributors to Manchin, donating around $211,000 through PACs and employees since 2009. Joe Manchin doesn't need to be in Congress,? Swearengin says.",
    "According to reporting first published by The Intercept, in 2006, Manchin, according to an unnamed source, instructed his then-chief of staff, Larry Puccio, to meet with Mon Power lobbyists so that they would petition the PSC to increase the Grant Town plant's rate from $27.25 to $34.25 per megawatt hour, pocketing an additional $4.5 million per year from customers.",
    "As climate journalist Brian Kahn tweeted, Republican state legislatures are trying to create a world where it's illegal to do anything but say nice things about fossil fuels and give the industry all your money.? In West Virginia, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is leading a fight to the Supreme Court to undercut the EPA's authority to regulate carbon emissions.",
    "We should be enormously skeptical, and as a populace demand far more transparency around any government plans to engage in such boondoggles.?\nIn many ways, CCS is just another grift, a way for power companies to harvest billions of dollars in federal funding and perpetuate the big lie that coal has a future in a world that takes the climate crisis seriously.",
    "But in the end, he was not as interested in listening to the utilities as he was in listening to the fossil-fuel industry.?\nManchin's public rationale that power companies are already transitioning away from fossil fuels as rapidly as possible is blatantly false: Ninety percent of the electricity generated in West Virginia still comes from coal.",
    "But that is not what any of them are doing.?\nAfter talking with Bevil, I drove through the broken streets of Beckley, past the abandoned beauty shops with vines growing over them, past billboards for divorce lawyers and ammo shops, past the markers commemorating dead coal miners near the courthouse, and onto the interstate toward Charleston.",
    "We still have this abstract conversation about decarbonization and emissions, and it's explicitly, purposefully devoid of words like coal or oil or gas, because our national leaders want markets to do the dirty work, and they really don't want to get their hands dirty with some of the legacy politics in places like West Virginia.",
    "We just need to figure out a way to grease the skids to make it happen faster.? One recent study found that local wind and solar could replace 80 percent of the U.S. coal fleet, giving immediate savings to customers, as well as saving lives by cutting air pollution and saving the climate by dramatically reducing carbon pollution.",
    "Never mind that the bill includes billions of dollars in programs that would help West Virginians struggling with poverty and hardship, or that without the tax breaks and other clean-energy measures in the bill, Biden's goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions in half from 2005 levels would be all but impossible to achieve.",
    "West Virginia would be paved in gold to get Build Back Better through.?\nAllison Bailey/NurPhoto/AP Images\nWith the clean-electricity standard, Manchin kept everyone on edge until a few weeks before the Glasgow climate summit, in which Biden and his team hoped to prove to the world that the U.S. was serious about climate action.",
    "The Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA), passed in 1978 in response to the energy crisis of 1973, was meant to break the monopoly of utilities over electric-power generation and encourage independent power producers to build smaller, more innovative power plants fueled by hydroelectric power, solar, and natural gas.",
    "Even the conservative International Energy Agency has said that there can be no new fossil-fuel infrastructure (especially coal) if we are to keep warming under 1.5 C/3 F, a level beyond which we commit to some of the worst impacts of climate change.?\nThere are lots of reasons why coal has proved to be so hard to get rid of.",
    "And I've got to find something that's going to give you that same mission and purpose that you long for.' That's what Joe Manchin should be doing, instead of talking about the virtues of coal.?\nBoth Goldman Sachs and the United Mine Workers of America  two voices from opposite ends of the economic universe  apparently agree.",
    "In Beckley today, there is a lot of chamber-of-commerce hype about the promise of tourism  the toll booths on Interstate 64 leading into the city are plastered with images of men fly-fishing in pristine mountain creeks  but the hard truth is people are leaving West Virginia faster than any other state in the nation.",
    "Kidus Girma, a 26-year-old Sunrise Movement activist who helped organize protests against Manchin this past fall, calls him the final villain.?\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call/AP Images\nManchin's influence comes from the fact that in an evenly divided Senate, he is the swing vote that can make or break legislation.",
    "Now we're going to get screwed again, on solar.?\nTo Mullins, this is one of the invisible legacies of King Coal: It built a patriarchal economy and political culture, where rich outsiders come to Appalachia, extract what they want, suck out all the profits, and leave the people of West Virginia with nothing.",
    "If you think about what we've been through this year with fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and then take that to a global scale, and then accelerate that and increase the human pain that will be caused if we can't get on track [with carbon-pollution reductions]  it's just so enormous,? says John Podesta.",
    "U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers described the operation as likely the largest bribery, money-laundering scheme ever perpetrated against the people of the state of Ohio.?\nWhen Manchin is pressed about the fact that he makes a half-million dollars a year from a company that brokers waste coal, he lashes out.",
    "He's always hanging out with CEOs, but has no time for people like me.?\nBeckley, a small city in the heart of West Virginia's southern coal fields, is an old company town, where for decades men (and they were almost all men) worked to haul hundreds of millions of tons of coal out of the ground.",
    "But much of the state is a landscape of corporate exploitation, a place that has been pillaged by outsiders who have sucked out its gas and mined its coal and built mansions in Newport, Rhode Island, and the Hamptons, but left little behind beyond black lung and broken labor unions.",
    "It's operated by a privately held company called American Bituminous Power Partners (AmBit), which sells the electricity under contract to Mon Power, a West Virginia utility that's a subsidiary of Ohio-based FirstEnergy, one of the largest electric companies in the United States.",
    "However it plays out, the idea that the fate of the Earth's climate has wound up in the hands of a Maserati-driving senator from coal country is a plot twist that belongs in a Hollywood disaster movie, not here in the real world where millions of people suffer as a consequence.",
    "Canter calls Manchin's whole scheme the definition of a conflict of interest.?\nOnce you understand how the Manchin family business works, you understand why the senator drives a Maserati (Hollywood could not cast a better vehicle for this guy to be driving,? says Kidus Girma).",
    "Sometimes, the coal industry isn't just the elephant in the room,? commented Wolfgang Blau, co-founder of the Oxford Climate Journalism Network, but the actual room itself.? Overnight, 23 countries made commitments for the first time to phase out coal power.",
    "They not only greenlighted $400 million in investments to keep the old coal plants running until 2040, but, according to Van Nostrand, they also basically directed the utility to spend whatever it takes to keep them running, even if clean energy is cheaper.",
    "If Build Back Better goes down,? says John Podesta, a Democratic powerbroker and former special adviser to President Obama who has been deeply involved in international climate negotiations, then we are completely fucked.?\nAll this could change overnight.",
    "Unmined places like New River Gorge (now a national park) hint at the spectacular beauty of West Virginia before the coal barons arrived; up in Morgantown, you see a thriving city that is not entirely built with money from mining and burning black rocks.",
    "As governor, Manchin recast the state's Department of Environmental Protection from enforcement toward what he called compliance assistance,? which accelerated the growth of mountaintop-removal mining and loosened safety regulations in underground mines.",
    "Instead, West Virginians have been paying millions of dollars each year in higher electricity costs in order to keep running a dirty, inefficient power plant that is sickening and killing people with dirty air, but paying the Manchin family handsomely.",
    "How do you replace the good pay and union jobs that will be lost as we shut down the coal industry?? Guay argues that for all the talk about the Green New Deal, there has been no real thinking about how to actually manage the transition away from coal.",
    "In America, that power and inertia is embodied in the cruel and cartoonish character of West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who, paradoxically, may have more control over the trajectory of the climate crisis than any other person on the planet right now.",
    "Politicians in West Virginia and Texas and Wyoming are aligning with lobbying groups like the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) to keep coal alive, no matter the cost to their economy, their constituents, or the climate.",
    "Just as red-state politicians are trying to rig democracy by commandeering local election boards and oversight committees, coal boosters are taking over public-service committees that regulate utilities to help slow transition to clean energy.",
    "Still, the agreement nearly fell apart in a last-minute dispute when a pledge to phase out? coal was diluted to phase down.? More than 40 countries signed the pledge, but the U.S., perhaps fearful of offending Manchin, was not one of them.",
    "As Saul Griffith, an Australian American inventor and engineer, and MacArthur genius? grant winner, recently put it: Carbon capture and storage is a fraught fantasy of the fossil-fuel industry trying to extend the period of its relevance.",
    "So we don't have any renewable power, and we don't have any energy-efficiency rules.? West Virginia has the dubious distinction of being one of the first states to pass a renewable-energy standard  and then roll it back a few years later.",
    "The provision offered a carrot-and-stick approach to cutting carbon pollution, providing federal payments to utilities that increase their share of clean energy by four percent each year, while imposing federal fees on those that do not.",
    "As I stood there on the ridgetop, it occurred to me that if future historians want to tell the story of how humans turned our home into a hell zone of fire, drought, and rising seas, this would be as good of a place as any to begin.",
    "On the way, I detoured on a back road to Danville, a small town in Boone County, to visit the skeleton of the Hobet 21 mine, where I had first witnessed the explosions and destruction of mountaintop-removal mining 20 years earlier.",
    "Although burning gob can help clean up abandoned mine sites, it also transfers pollutants from the land into the air, which is why, on a pollutants-per-kilowatt-hours basis, Grant Town is the dirtiest coal plant in West Virginia.",
    "In addition, 25 countries and public-finance institutions pledged to end overseas public funding for fossil fuels by the end of 2022, and major international banks said they would stop financing new coal power by the end of 2021.",
    "But a larger part of the trouble is that the coal industry runs the state, and the fundamental belief of everyone in the coal business, according to Van Nostrand, is that the power business in West Virginia is a zero-sum game.",
    "As governor, Manchin had control over appointments to the all-powerful West Virginia Public Service Commission (PSC), which in turn gave him influence over the committee's decisions to set utility rates and approve contracts.",
    "ALEC is pushing treasurers and state financiers in 15 states to fight back against woke capitalism?  banks and financial institutions that focus on clean energy and refuse to do business with fossil-fuel companies.",
    "And without U.S. leadership on climate, the chances that the nations of the world will reduce emissions fast enough to hold warming at 1.5 C, which is the threshold for dangerous climate change, is virtually zero.",
    "Instead, Manchin announced in a closed-door meeting with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and White House aides just two weeks before the conference began that he couldn't support the clean-electricity standard.",
    "No scenario for stabilizing warming below truly dangerous levels allows for substantial additional extraction and burning of coal,? says Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann, author of The New Climate War.",
    "But now, due to skyrocketing electric bills, Blankenship says, I'm gonna campaign as hard as I can to make sure Joe Manchin is not reelected.?\nPlants like John Amos are also ground zero for the climate crisis.",
    "Exhibit A: FirstEnergy, the parent company of Mon Power, was recently enmeshed in an epic scandal in which it paid $60 million in bribes in a complex scheme to pass a state bailout of nuclear plants in Ohio.",
    "Virginia Canter, who was ethics counsel to Presidents Obama and Clinton, unabashedly calls Manchin's business operations a grift.? To Canter, Manchin's corruption is even more offensive than Donald Trump's.",
    "It was because of West Virginia's dependence on outdated coal plants that power prices in West Virginia had risen five times faster than the national average over the past decade, according to Van Nostrand.",
    "Most of the coal that is mined on the company's land is metallurgical coal, used to make steel, which was selling for $200 a ton in recent years, a very good price that Bevil was clearly happy about.",
    "In an effort to win Manchin's support, the Build Back Better bill includes a provision that would give utilities billions in dollars in tax breaks for each ton of carbon that is captured and stored.",

    "Even with the endgame underway, the power of coal is reasserting itself in the U.S. Something like a fossil-fuel confederacy is taking shape, devoted to maintaining our addiction to fossil fuels.",
