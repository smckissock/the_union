    "That clash has unfolded the past two weeks as Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, unveiled his 11-point GOP platform  parts of which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has rebuffed, reiterating that he would be the one in charge of a Republican majority.",
    "But Democrats have plenty to worry about themselves: In a friendly midterm environment for Republicans, with the momentum on their side, intraparty mudslinging and big primary spending still might not be enough to tip the scales toward Democrats in November.",
    "At the same time, this is going to be such a wave year that except in the most egregious examples of poor candidate recruitment, I think Republicans are going to be fine.?\nAfter all, Republican primary voters are angry and juiced up,? Keller said.",
