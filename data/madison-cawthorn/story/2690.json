    "Topline\nRep. Madison Cawthorn's (R-N.C.) tumultuous stretch of personal scandal and legal trouble might be starting to hurt him politically, according to a poll from a national Republican group, which found the controversies have seriously hurt the freshman congressman's image among his constituents.",
    "Over the past 10 days, Cawthorn has been cited for bringing a gun to an airport, been implicated in an alleged insider trading scheme and been called a hypocrite by critics after leaked photographs showed the self-proclaimed traditional Christian drinking and wearing women's lingerie at a party.",
    "Late last month, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Cawthorn to make life choices to \"turn himself around\" after Cawthorn claimed D.C. political figures invited him to orgies and did cocaine in front of him.",
    "Former President Donald Trump has raved about Cawthorn, saying at a GOP event last summer the congressman is a \"handsome sucker\" that has a \"good future.\"",
    "His win in the 2020 election made him the youngest person elected to Congress since Jed Johnson Jr. in 1964.",
    "McCarthy said Cawthorn privately admitted the allegations were either made up or exaggerated.",
    "A runoff will only be held for the GOP primary if no candidates receive over 30% of the vote.",
    "Cawthorn was a featured speaker at Trump's rally in North Carolina on April 9.",
    "If the 30% threshold is hit, the top candidate captures the GOP nomination.",
    "Republican leaders were already upset with Cawthorn before this stretch.",
    "\"By every metric, Cawthorn's campaign trajectory is terrible.\"",
    "\"Will Madison Cawthorn lose the primary on May 17th?",
    "Cawthorn, 26, is the youngest member of Congress.",
    "The short answer: maybe,\" a polling memo said."
