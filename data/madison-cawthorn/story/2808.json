    "Section 5 of the 14th Amendment emphasizes this principle: Congress, it states, shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.?\nIn short, Griffin's case teaches that in legal terms, Section 3 is not self-executing  that is, Congress must establish, or at least authorize, the process that affords accused insurrectionists an opportunity to contest the allegations brought against them.",
    "If the Justice Department does not secure a conviction of a Section 3 disqualifying offense before the state ballot is printed (the primary in North Carolina is scheduled for May 17 and the one in Georgia for May 24), then, generally, state boards of election and even state courts will be powerless to remove otherwise eligible congressional candidates from the ballot.",

    "Chief Justice Chase ruled against Mr. Griffin, finding that Section 3 did not disqualify Judge Sheffey, despite the fact that he had taken an oath to support the U.S. Constitution and that it was admitted,? as the case stated, that he later committed a Section 3 disqualifying offense.",
    "If the courts find that Section 3 is not self-executing, there is no need for state election officials to decide far more politically charged questions about whether Mr. Cawthorn and Ms. Greene  and potentially, looking ahead to 2024, Donald Trump  engaged in insurrection.",
    "If the Justice Department indicts and succeeds in convicting Mr. Cawthorn, Ms. Greene or others of insurrection under that act, then on that basis, state elections boards and state courts may remove these candidates from the congressional ballot.",
    "But in light of an important 1869 judicial decision, the cases against Mr. Cawthorn and Ms. Greene  which are currently mired in both state and federal proceedings  cannot remove the candidates from the congressional ballot.",
    "Moreover, in the Cawthorn and Greene cases, the plaintiffs have not pointed to any federal legislation authorizing the states to police Section 3 by disqualifying accused insurrectionists from the congressional ballot.",

    "Chief Justice Chase added that the exclusion of disqualified office holders can only be provided for by Congress.? Congress must create the procedure that would determine if a defendant violated Section 3.",
    "In their view, even in the absence of a federal statute, state election officials who conclude that a person engaged in insurrection may proceed to remove that candidate from the congressional ballot.",
    "If these members of Congress engaged in insurrection, then the U.S. House of Representatives may exclude them, or federal prosecutors may charge them with the federal crime of insurrection.",
    "Still, we think the chief justice's opinion is persuasive; we expect state and federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, will likely follow this historically entrenched position.",
    "Chief Justice Chase reasoned that legislation by Congress is necessary to give effect to? Section 3 of the 14th Amendment  and that only? Congress can enact that legislation.",
    "Without federal authorization, state elections boards and even state courts could very well be powerless to make determinations about congressional candidates and Section 3.",
