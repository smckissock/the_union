    "She was able to win in a grassroots victory in 2018, she's proceeded to do things like ending cash bail, revolutionizing the approach to homelessness in Harris County, rejuvenating public transit, and added $13 million to the election administration budget in Harris County, which then helped turn out in 2020 in the county jump, including early vote numbers doubling over the most previous presidential election, because she made sure that they were able to open 24-hour polling centers and expand access to the polls through drive-in ways during the pandemic.",
    "Having worked on campaigns before it is so strange how much you focus on building up this incredibly complex machinery up until Election Day, and then assuming your race doesn't go to a runoff or a recall, or if it's too close to call something, for the vast majority of elections afterwards, everyone just sort of sits around the next day and they're like, \"Okay.\"",
    "Particularly in the Trump area, where you find Democrats who are afraid to go out and tell people in their community that they're Democrats, they're like, \"I don't know any other Democrats, I don't want say anything like at the restaurant or at some sort of community area, because everyone's a Republican and half the people are extremely aggressive about it.\"",
    "Now you don't see foreign policy play a major role in U.S. elections very often, particularly legislative elections, but the McCrory team who released the ad clearly believes that the really strong anti-Russian invasion response that's sprung up from the American public really across the board has given them here an opportunity to go after Budd.",
    "Amanda Litman:\nWell, I think we really want to make sure people understand that as a Democrat living in a red community, you are the best messenger to your Republican neighbors, because they might not like the Democrats they see on Fox News or hear about on the radio or see on TV, but it is much harder to hate the person you meet at your home.",
    "She came back to the town where she grew up because she wanted to do more on emergency response budgeting, because Harris County, the third largest county in America, had a really crappy structure for how they were prepared to respond to things like the now consistently once-in-a-generation flooding they were seeing every couple years.",
    "David Beard:\nSo along these lines, he promised that he's going to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, and he's also promised harsher penalties for wrongfully accusing men of sex crimes, which we all know will not actually do anything positive, but will discourage women from speaking out when sex crimes have occurred.",
    "Myers said that because Congress passed a bill in 1872 that gave amnesty to these former Confederates and a pretty shameful piece of legislation that was, but Myers said that because of this bill passed 150 years ago, that it was a prospective amnesty being granted for people who weren't even born yet up to and including Cawthorn.",
    "In both situations, the state courts implemented congressional maps that are by all metrics quite fair, which is why Republicans are extremely upset, especially in North Carolina where the legislature passed its own maps only to have them twice struck down by the courts, and then the court imposed a new map that is much fairer.",
    "For us, the focus especially post-2020 is as hyperlocal as we can be, because we have seen a lot of success, even in places where Trump won that we can elect Democrats to positions when the maps are not gerrymandered, and when the races are nonpartisan, and we can elect people who really share our values.",
    "David Beard:\nGiven that 2022 is coming up and it's likely to be not a great year for Democrats, it's the first time Run For Something has been in existence with there being a Democrat president and a Democratic Congress, so there's really a good chance that there's going to be some Republican wins.",
    "They are likely going to be appeals and just to give you a sense of what kind of lunatic this Myers is, when he was delivering his ruling, he said, \"The federal court is tasked with protecting the soap box, the ballot box, and the jury box, and when these fail people proceed to the ammunition box.\"",
    "David Beard:\nSo for aspiring candidates who have expressed interest, they've sort of gotten along at that first level, what would you say to them is sort of the key things to focus on both in terms of their campaign and in terms of looking to get Run For Something's endorsement at that stage?",
    "They are trying to rig the elections and to undermine trust in democracy, by ensuring that people like Nazis and conspiracy theorists and QAnoners, and even the woman who I guess just yesterday was charged with a crime for sharing secure election data with conspiracy theorists online.",
    "So Mr. Yoon has just come out today that he's very, very narrowly won the election by less than a percentage point with all of the votes provisionally counted, but the opposition Democratic Party has conceded the election, so he's expected that he'll officially win and take office.",
    "So for us, it's folks 40 and younger who are running for the first or second time for positions like school board, city council, coroner, state House, state Senate, community college board of trustees, boards of education that are the real building blocks of the democratic process.",
    "Amanda Litman:\nOnce you've gone through those initial hoops, which are pretty low lift, I would say, you have access to a whole bunch of risk resources from guides on how to file to get on the ballot in every state, written in real-people speak, not legalese or bureaucratic talk.",
    "Trainings that we run as well as the ones that hundreds of our partners run from Emily's List to the PCCC, to Emerge, to Collective PAC and Latino Victory Project, Victory Fund, and dozens and dozens and dozens of regional and state organizations that do trainings for candidates.",
    "Losing is terrible, but even if they lose, the act of campaigning, the act of knocking doors and making calls and pushing on the issues and cultivating talent through the campaign organization is how you get from a 70/30 district to a 60/40 to a 55/45 to one that's flippable.",
    "He took the organization he had built, he took the infrastructure he had built and then turned it into a Facebook group, a nonprofit, an organizing vehicle, a recycling program, and then was able to leverage that a couple years later to this time run and be more successful.",
    "It is helping what I think is, and maybe I drink my own Kool-Aid a little bit, but what I think is the most important mission the Democratic Party could tackle right now, which is building both short-term and long-term sustainable power from the ground up, so thank you.",
    "We also spend time exploring a trio of different stories out of North Carolinaone concerning Madison Cawthorn, one about redistricting, and one, believe it or not, about Vladimir Putinand bring you up to speed on the just-concluded presidential election in South Korea.",
    "David Beard:\nAnd the hypocrisy here is really that a number of these justices signed on to a recent opinion a few years ago that said that they couldn't get involved in any partisan gerrymandering cases, because there was no way for the justices to rule on it fairly.",
    "In this week's episode of The Downballot, we talk with Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run for Something, an organization she formed in the wake of the 2016 elections to help young, diverse progressives run for office across the country at all levels of the ballot.",
    "There are about 5,000 across the country, across 35 states that are elected local election administrators, which is a very complicated way of saying a bunch of people who control how elections are meaningfully run, that we then get to decide at the ballot box.",
    "At Daily Kos Elections, we're constantly talking about the data side of things, the new side of things, but where you are at is really where the rubber meets the road of how campaigns actually happen in these downballot races that seldom get enough attention.",
    "David Nir:\nOur guest on today's show is Amanda Litman, one of the co-founders of Run for Something, a new group that sprung up in the wake of the 2016 elections that's devoted to helping young diverse progressives run for office at all levels of the ballot.",
    "And if anyone who's ever listened to this has started a small business, yes, a lot of it is the philosophical belief and the vision you have, but a lot more of it is just logistics, that if you've never done it before, you don't even know where to start.",
    "She flipped a seat red to blue in both places, and was I think in her first one, the first Democrat to ever hold the seat, or was one of the first Democrats to hold it in quite a long time in the state House, and then again, in the state Senate.",
    "I think that we are going to see a case before long where the Supreme Court adopts some version of this crazy doctrine that says that when it comes to redistricting, state legislatures have absolute unfettered authority to do whatever they want.",
    "So what kind of support does Run For Something offer to the candidates you've decided to work with and how much of it is sort of one-size-fits-all versus how much of it has to be customized to this specific race that the person is running in?",
    "We want to make sure you align with our progressive values, but we know that progressive looks a little different, say in Brooklyn where I live versus maybe Iowa City or Oahu or Anchorage or anywhere else where we're working with candidates.",
    "Amanda Litman:\nSo I reached out to a whole bunch of peopleone of whom became my co-founder, Rossand we wrote a plan and we built a website and then we launched Run for Something on Trump's Inauguration Day, thinking it would be really small.",
    "And we train our volunteers to both get a little bit more information about you as a potential candidate, but also to make sure you have a little bit more information about us and about the places we've worked and how we engage with people.",
    "I didn't have an answer for them, because at the time, if you were young and newly excited about politics and wanted to do more than vote and more than volunteer, there was nowhere you could go that would be guaranteed to take your call.",
    "And some of it is definitely broad and applicable to every race because at the end of the day, mechanics of campaigns are basically the same, but we also do a lot of one-on-one coaching and support, or one-to-few coaching and support.",
    "David Nir:\nBeard, it reminds me of that old tweet from the Twitter account Dril where he says, \"Issuing a correction on a previous post of mine regarding the terror group ISIL, you do not under any circumstances, got hand it to him.\"",
    "That would be the notorious Madison Cawthorn, whose eligibility to appear on the ballot this November has been challenged by a group of voters under an unusual and interesting North Carolina law that is based on the 14th Amendment.",
    "We have with us today Amanda Litman, who is the co-founder and co-executive director of Run for Something, an organization that recruits and supports young, diverse progressives to run for downballot races all over the country.",
    "We worked with a guy in 2017 who was running in a small town in the Midwest for a city council position because he really cared about climate, and he wanted to bring his small town over to solar energy, that was his big issue.",
    "Amanda Litman:\nWe worked with another coroner candidate out in Colorado who wasn't able to win, but his campaign was running on the idea that the current coroner had been misgendering trans people on their death certificates.",
    "I would like to ask you before we sign off, if someone is interested in supporting your work at Run For Something, or if they're interested in becoming a candidate and would like Run For Something's help, what should they do?",
    "And this has really developed and become a big problem in South Korea, where these young men are looking for a reason why housing costs are so high, why there's all this rising inequality and they're struggling to find jobs.",
    "North Carolina, South Korea, and why you should Run For Something, with Amanda Litman\nThe Downballot\nFollowShare\n0:0042:43\n15301xMar 10, 2022\n image/svg+xml\nPowered by Libsyn\nPowered by Libsyn\nDavid Beard:\nHello and welcome.",
    "Litman tells us about the resources they offer to first-time candidates, some of Run for Something's biggest success stories, and her favorite obscure post that you might not even know is an elected position in many states.",
    "You know what I think about how do you deliver for people and how do you make sure they feel seen and heard, especially when they don't agree with you or like you, or think you're part of a good political party or process?",
    "You have Brett Kavanaugh who wrote his own concurring opinion saying that he thought it was really too late to get involved, but he's definitely very interested in this theory, this independent state legislature doctrine.",
    "David Nir:\nThis week, the United States Supreme Court rejected Republican appeals that they intervene in two cases, one decided by the North Carolina Supreme Court, the other decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.",
    "And that's really not where the mood of the country is since the invasion has taken place for obvious reasons, so this could turn out to be a real problem for one or more of particularly the Trumpist GOP candidates.",
    "If you won, there's some planning for the office that you've won, but then if you've lost, it really is just like, \"How do we close this shop that we spent so much time building, in usually a short amount of time?\"",
    "Endorsed candidates are who we track through to Election Day and who we recommend to reporters and to other organizations and who we amplify on social, those are the people we consider part of our alumni community.",
    "David Nir:\nAnd it's no surprise that this is happening once again, out of North Carolina where Republicans have engaged in some of the worst abuses both in redistricting and in election administration in general.",
    "And it's no surprise that we are once again talking about North Carolina, a state where Republican behavior regarding redistricting and election administration in general has been truly the worst of the worst.",
    "Despite South Korea having the highest gender wage gap among wealthy countries, nearly 79% of South Korean men in their 20s say they were victims of serious gender discrimination, according to a recent poll.",
    "One saving grace here is that the Democratic Party, which is outgoing President Moon's more progressive party, still controls the legislature through at least 2024 when the next legislative elections are up.",
    "They're just so amazing, and it's very cool to see these people run and win and lead and then make a difference in people's lives in a way that, like the baseball term, the value over replacement is so high.",
    "This is the kind of elected position that deals with people in a moment of true pain, and it really matters that's someone who has deep empathy and compassion for people and who could run a competent office.",
    "We want to be able to fight back in a way as meaningful as possible, especially understanding that what happens in a school board ripples out because it determines the kind of people our kids grow up to be.",
    "The U.S. Supreme Court said it wouldn't block either map from taking effect this year, but as far as we can tell, the only reason why it didn't intervene is because of how late it is in the election cycle.",
    "Every person we endorse also gets matched with someone we've endorsed in a previous cycle, and we call this our alumni mentorship program, because what we've heard is that running for office really sucks.",
    "We are doing everything we can to recruit as many candidates as possible for as many of these positions as possible before it's too late, which it almost is, but it's not late, not past the deadline yet.",
    "So how did you see and how has developed the long-term look at Run for Something, because these are candidates who hopefully get elected at a very local level and then someday may run for higher office.",
    "And when we return, we will be talking with Amanda Litman, who is the co-founder of Run for Something, an organization that helps young progressives run for office at all levels all over the country.",
    "But if they enacted this new concept of independent state legislatures, they couldn't even create independent commissions, which was the very thing that they had pointed to as a way to resolve this.",
    "What are you going to be able to do in this position that you couldn't do elsewhere that you can only do here to make progress on the problem you care about, and why should voters want you to win?",

    "So when Lina moved home, she's looked at the landscape and realized the position that handles these kinds of offices is the county executive, which in Harris County is called the county judge.",
    "So when you think about the long-term vision for what we're trying to build, it's both a bench of talent, but also a broader way of understanding where Democrats can and should be competing.",
    "David Beard:\nAnd if that's true, if this does end up being something that's hurting Budd in the polls as the election gets closer, it's something we could see develop in other races as well.",
    "So if you have a question about building a website, you submit it, we will match you directly with someone who said they want to volunteer their time to build websites for local candidates.",
    "Everything else from how to get on the ballot, to what to do when you're on there, we can teach you, but we can't teach you to care and we can't teach you to have work ethic around this.",
    "If you do want to give us money and we would love your money, because we're trying to build something big and unprecedented and important, runforsomething.net/donate is where to find us.",
    "We want to make sure you're running for the place you're in, that the issues are really localized and that you have a vision for how you're going to talk to as many voters as possible.",
    "And feminism has really been the scapegoat that a lot of these young men have found to blame all of their problems on instead of dealing with a lot of these economic inequality issues.",
    "And so this is really, as opposed to looking at the 2018 elections or looking at the 2020 elections, this is an organization that really looks at the next 10, 20, 30 years in America.",
    "David Beard:\nI'm back in North Carolina, which I promise won't happen every week, but there's a lot of interesting stuff going on in my home state, so that's where I'm going to start.",
    "Because the most important thing a local candidate can do, and this is especially true in a place where it's going to be really hard, is building a personal relationship with voters.",
    "David Beard:\nMcCrory just released his first TV ad of the cycle on Wednesday, where he actually attacks Budd for some positive-sounding comments that he's made about Vladimir Putin.",
    "Now, one of the issues that I found a lot working in politics that you've touched on a little bit, but I wanted to delve a little more into is Democrats in really deeply red areas.",
    "But before we get to our conversation with Amanda, we have our weekly hits where we are going to be talking about North Carolina, North Carolina, North Carolina, and South Korea.",

    "Madison Cawthorn really said some outrageous and horrible stuff that day he spoke at the \"Stop the Steal? rally where Trump whipped up his minions to go and attack the capitol.",
    "We have an application, we want to see your campaign plan, your budget, your WIN number, how you're going to get from A to Z.\nAmanda Litman:\nWe do rigorous background checks.",
    "Are there any positions that you were surprised to learn about or maybe what was the most unusual elected office that someone came to you and said, \"I want to run for this?\"",
    "Run for something as working in as many of those races as possible, because we know as Trump has told us, they care more about who counts the votes than who's on the ballot.",
    "The comments that he's made are explainable and the Budd campaign has attempted to explain them by saying that they're simply observations about Putin as opposed to praise.",
    "McCrory is the more pre-Trump GOP establishment candidate, while Budd has been endorsed by Trump and he's definitely more the candidate of the Trumpist wing of the party.",
    "In other words, he was saying that if he doesn't let Madison Cawthorn the ballot, some people might start shooting and therefore that is why he won't enforce the law.",
    "Knowing that in 2018, there were all these great opportunities, picking up a bunch of seats everywhere, so that made it a little bit easier than in more neutral year.",
    "Which makes a real difference when you think about the way that crime statistics are reported and the fact that trans folks are disproportionately victims of crimes.",
    "David Beard:\nWe've been talking about races all up and down the ballot here at Daily Kos Elections and certainly The Downballot, we love talking about obscure races.",
    "And what this theory says is that when it comes to federal elections, only state legislatures and no other body in the states can decide how those elections are run.",
    "There are 21,000 school board positions on the ballot this year, but half of them are up in November, but the other half happened throughout the course of the year.",
    "Amanda Litman:\nIf you are the kind of person that listens to this podcast, you're the kind of person that should run for a local office, we would love to help you.",
    "It's very cool to see people understand that Election Day is not the beginning or the end of your civic engagement no matter the results, it is just the next step.",
    "He had the good fortune to appear before an extremist Trump judge named Richard Meyers and Richard Myers issued a ruling the other day that is completely bonkers.",
    "But I'd love to hear from you, Amanda, about some of your favorite success stories, whether in the short term, or looking more longer term like you were saying.",
    "There's a couple of others with former Congressman Mark Walker being the other third candidate in the race, but it's really primarily between McCrory and Budd.",
    "As we looked to this year in particular, we really wanted to focus on the two places where we thought there was the biggest crisis and the biggest opportunity.",
    "Amanda Litman:\nIn particular, when she was running for state Senate, her campaign, I believe talked to every senior citizen in the district, every single one.",

    "Voters have said that Madison Cawthorn in his actions on and during the insurrection on Jan. 6 is therefore ineligible to hold office per the Constitution.",
    "Then the ad goes on to ding Budd for voting against sanctions on Russia and ends with McCrory saying I don't compliment our enemies? in a very tough voice.",
    "Another one that I'm really excited about is down in Florida, state representative Anna Askamani, outside Orlando who flipped a seat red to blue in 2018.",
    "Most notably he complimented the former South Korean dictator, Chun Doo-hwan, and he's also claimed that systemic gender discrimination no longer exists.",
    "And one of the things I find really interesting and positive about Run for Something is that, as you said, it came out of the ashes of the 2016 election.",
    "Amanda Litman:\nWe say that investing in local politics, like what Run for Something does, is good for politics and good for policy and it's good today.",
    "Now we are seeing their talent move up the ladder, but we have also seen our folks run in districts and just move the needle, get a little bit closer.",
    "Her team has helped nearly 50,000 Floridians access unemployment benefits at a time when the state intentionally made it difficult for folks to do so.",
    "How do you advise them on these deeply red areas, where A, it's going to be hard just to run and B, they have next to no chance of getting elected?",
    "As of today, we're up to more than 110,000 young people all across the country who've raised their hands and said, \"I want to run for local office.",
    "David Nir:\nThe real reason is a dissent that Sam Alito, one of the most extreme far right justices on the court, wrote in the North Carolina case.",
    "So we really want candidates who, as they're thinking about engaging in this process can answer that question and then are willing to do the work.",
    "We know this is where Republicans and QAnons, and Proud Boys and Moms for Liberty and the Leadership Institute are focusing a lot of their effort.",
    "So the college student who ran in 2018 will work with a college student who ran in 2020 who's now working with a college student running in 2022.",
    "So Yoon will be constrained in passing new legislation until then, but as we've seen here in America, the executive can do a lot outside of that.",
    "He's a former governor of one of the larger states in South Korea and he's from, as I said, President Moon's more progressive Democratic Party.",
    "And then the other leading candidate was Prosecutor Yoon Suk-yeol of the opposition People Power Party, which is the more conservative party.",
    "Whatever way makes sense for the safety in your community, but do you have a vision and a plan for grassroots engagement in a meaningful way?",
    "She was like a 20-something young woman who really, really cared about divesting from fossil fuel or divest campaigns on her college campus.",
    "And all of this is part of a broader antifeminist movement that's been taking hold among many people in South Korea, particularly young men.",
