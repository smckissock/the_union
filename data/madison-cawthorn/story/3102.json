    "g #JoinTheChorushttps://t.co/aQIm8a2xuZ pic.twitter.com/xBtN2CYF30\n Clay Aiken (@clayaiken) January 10, 2022\nAiken, 43, has had a career in music, theater and reality shows  in addition to political and social activism  since finishing second to Ruben Studdard on the TV singing contest in 2003.\nHey, folks.",
    "Aiken's celebrity status is not quite as strong as it was eight years ago, and he still has not served in elected office before, Meredith College political science professor David McLennan said in an interview Monday.",
    "He told The News & Observer of Raleigh that when his eighth grade middle-school class studied the 1992 election, Aiken asked his teacher if he could invite a politician to speak, and contacted Price, who agreed.",
    "Aiken, who would be the first openly LGBTQ person elected to Congress from the South if he won in November, said he would provide a counterweight in state politics to hardline Republicans such as Lt. Gov.",
    "The state's congressional map is being challenged in court as an illegal gerrymander, however, meaning the lines could be altered and candidates may reconsider the district in which they could run.",
    "In a video announcing his bid in the 6th District, Aiken said he's joining the already crowded field for the Democratic primary, which has been delayed from March to mid-May due to litigation.",
    "RALEIGH, N.C.  Former American Idol? runner-up Clay Aiken announced Monday he's running for Congress again in North Carolina, this time seeking to succeed the retiring U.S. Rep. David Price.",
    "As a loud and proud Democrat, I intend to use my voice to deliver real results for North Carolina families, just like David Price has done for decades,? Aiken said in a news release.",
    "Aiken, who grew up in North Carolina and now lives in the Raleigh area, said he'd work to promote inclusion, provide free, high-quality health care and fight climate change.",
    "It includes all of Orange and Durham counties  home to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, and very affluent western Wake County.",
    "As Democrats, we have got to get better about speaking up and using our voices, because those folks ain't quieting down anytime soon,? Aiken says in the video.",
    "Aiken won the Democratic nomination for a largely rural central congressional district in 2014, edging former state Commerce Secretary Keith Crisco.",
    "Many Democrats have called on Robinson to resign for comments he's made about sex education in schools that critics say disparaged LGBTQ people.",
    "Valerie Foushee of Orange County and Wiley Nickel of Wake County; Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam; and virologist Richard Watkins.",
    "But Aiken proved to be a credible candidate in 2014 and could benefit in the primary from efforts to link himself to Price, he said.",
    "The high-tech Research Triangle Park is within the 6th District, and where Price has been serving almost continuously since 1987.",
    "While that district was comfortably Republican, the proposed 6th District that Aiken is running in is overwhelmingly Democratic.",
    "The top two vote-getters would advance to a runoff if the leading candidate does not receive more than 30% of the vote.",
    "But he lost in the general election to then-Republican incumbent Renee Ellmers, receiving 41% of the vote.",
    "Now, I know I look a little different these days, but we've met before,? he says in the video.",
    "Can you believe it's been almost 20 years since I first got to share my voice with you?",
    "The 6th District primary winner would almost assuredly win the general election.",
    "Aiken said it was Price who helped him get interested in politics as a child.",
    "Announced 6th District Democratic primary candidates include state Sens.",
    "We need powerful voices more than ever, so I'm running for Congress.",
    "But any Triangle-area district should favor a Democrat.",
    "Mark Robinson and U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn.",
    "And my voice is even stronger now!",
    "That's a long time.",
    "A LOT has changed!",
    "It's been awhile."
