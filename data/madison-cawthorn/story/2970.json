    "\"If the language of the Elections Clause is taken seriously, there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections,\" he wrote in his dissent.",
    "In Alabama, the high court halted an ordered a lower federal court to redrawing the state's congressional map and struck down attempts by anti-gerrymandering advocates and Democrats who were hoping to add a second Black-majority congressional district in the state.",
    "But in their decisions this redistricting cycle, conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court justices left the door open for these maps to be changed after 2022, and for a debate on how much power state courts should have over the redistricting process.",
    "Four states are still in the process of redrawing their congressional lines, while at least 21 states are currently in or have seen litigation over their passed congressional or state legislative lines, according to the Brennan Center.",
    "In its decision, the Supreme Court said that the Wisconsin Supreme Court is \" free to take additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor's maps rather than choose from among the other submissions.",
    "The Supreme Court said that Evers' \"main explanation for drawing the seventh majority-black district was that there is now a sufficiently large and compact population of black residents to fill it.\"",

    "The Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this month selected Evers' proposed legislative and congressional maps after hearing oral arguments from several groups that had also submitted maps.",

    "In Pennsylvania and North Carolina, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Republican-led attempts to throw out the maps adopted by their respective state supreme courts.",
    "Justice Brian Hagedorn, the court's conservative swing vote, said that Evers' \"proposed senate and assembly maps produce less overall change than other submissions.\"",
    "The unsigned per curiam decision said that reasoning embraced \"just the sort of uncritical majority-minority district maximization that we have expressly rejected.\"",
    "In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Elana Kagan, called the Supreme Court's decision \"not only extraordinary but also unnecessary.\"",
    "In their decisions, the court cited the upcoming primary election dates as reason to not drastically change congressional lines before the 2022 midterm elections.",

    "The Wisconsin Supreme Court had told parties that it would select maps that made the \"least change\" to the current maps.",
    "The Supreme Court has, so far, shied away from ordering redraws of congressional maps that have already been passed.",
    "Both maps kept the political split of Democratic and Republican seats relatively equal and competitive.",
    "The court said there is still \"sufficient time\" to adopt maps before Wisconsin's August 9 primary.",
    "Hagedorn also determined that Evers' proposals had satisfied the state and federal constitutions.",
    "Those lines are expected to hold a GOP advantage in Wisconsin's congressional delegation.",
