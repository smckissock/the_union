    "While learned folk busy themselves with that, we mortals can chew on the new star's name  Earendel, named by Brian Welch, the 27-year-old Johns Hopkins University doctoral candidate who was lead author of the report of its discovery.",
    "And partisan battles raged on, especially in state primary campaigns, with all sorts of charges that purported to be informative but only in the sense that they inform you about the character of the informer.",
    "It's a lovely word, Old English for \"morning star,\" and if it has a ring of familiarity it might be because it comes from the name of a character in \"The Silmarillion\" by J.R.R.",

    "The past week was a catalog of misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, and seven hours and 37 minutes of missing information.",

    "Which is really impressive until you learn that its light traveled 12.9 billion years before smacking into Hubble's mirror.",
    "Which is why when a beam of light arrives from 12.9 billion years ago, you grab hold of the pureness you hope it to be.",
    "Now, everything is relative in the world of astronomy, a branch of science specializing in numbers with lots of zeros.",
    "But the particular numbers associated with this new discovery were, to borrow from the vernacular, mind-blowing.",
    "And about how infinitesimal our existence really is, temporally and spatially, and how humbling that is.",
    "This star, says the team of astronomers who found it, is 50 to 100 times more massive than our own sun.",
    "A seemingly straight-arrow tech platform, LinkedIn, was called out for disinformation on its site.",
