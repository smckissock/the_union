    "I'm privileged to participate with the team from Free Speech for People and my fellow North Carolina counsel, in this critically important effort to enforce that constitutional mandate and disqualify Madison Cawthorn from attempting to be elected to public office in 2022.?\nThe purpose of the constitutional provision relied on by the challengers to Mr. Cawthorn's candidacy is to prevent persons who sought illegally to overthrow a duly elected government from participating in running that government,? said James G. Exum, Jr. The challengers believe the evidence will show Mr. Cawthorn to be one of those persons.?\nCurrently, Cawthorn represents North Carolina's 11th Congressional District, but for the 2022 election, he filed a notice of candidacy for the redrawn 13th Congressional District.",
    "Specifically, the evidence provides reasonable suspicion that he helped to plan efforts to intimidate Congress and the Vice President into rejecting valid electoral votes, including by helping to plan the demonstration at the Ellipse and/or march on the Capitol, for the purpose of obstructing essential constitutional functions and preventing an orderly transition of power to the lawfully elected incoming government, with the advance knowledge that the events he helped plan were substantially likely to lead to the violent assault on the Capitol.",
    "We look forward to asking him about his involvement under oath.?\nUnder North Carolina's candidacy challenge statute, any registered voter in his district may challenge his candidacy based on reasonable suspicion or belief? that he does not meet the constitutional or statutory qualifications for the office.? Once a challenge is filed, the burden of proof shifts to the candidate, who must show by a preponderance of the evidence .",
    "The voters are represented by Free Speech For People, a nonpartisan, non-profit legal advocacy organization with constitutional law expertise, which is serving as lead counsel in the matter; Wallace & Nordan, a North Carolina law firm specializing in election law; and Robert F. Orr, a former Republican Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.",
    "As set forth in our complaint, the publicly available evidence, including Representative Cawthorn's own statements and reports that he or his office coordinated with the January 6 organizers, establish reasonable suspicion that Representative Cawthorn aided the insurrection, thereby disqualifying him from federal office.",
    "to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.? The purpose of the Disqualification Clause, passed in the wake of the Civil War, is not to punish the oathbreaker but rather to protect the country.",
    "Our Revolution members Dr. Jay Walsh and Claude Boisson, two of the eleven challengers bringing this matter before the North Carolina State Board of Elections, explain their decision to join this action:\nDr. Walsh: I am a semi-retired psychiatrist and registered independent residing in Morganton, North Carolina.",
    "The challenge, filed before the North Carolina State Board of Elections, alleges that Cawthorn is constitutionally disqualified from public office under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution based on reasonable suspicion that he helped facilitate the January 6, 2021 insurrection.",
    "While state election authorities cannot impose additional qualifications upon federal candidates, they can (as confirmed by then-Judge, now-Justice Neil Gorsuch) exclude candidates from the ballot who do not meet the qualifications established by the Constitution itself.",

    "including a subpoena of the candidate.? The challengers intend to depose Cawthorn and members of his staffsomething that the U.S. House January 6 Select Committee has not yet done.",
    "His speeches, tweets, and other public statements establish reasonable suspicion that he helped plan the demonstration and/or march with advance knowledge of the violent attack.",
    "In the weeks leading up to January 6, Cawthorn publicly urged his followers to threaten and intimidate Members of Congress into blocking certification of 2020 election results.",
    "No criminal conviction or prior adjudication is required under the Disqualification Clause, although Cawthorn would be able to seek judicial review of an adverse decision.",
