    "Making matters worse, China's subsequent lies about the contagiousness and lethality of COVID-19 increased the tragic loss of life and economic damage to America and Americans.?\nThe funds collected through the tariffs on China would go to pay for Americans' loss of earnings, medical expenses, loss of death, and financial losses of U.S. businesses, among other things.",

Brooks said.",
    "Those tariffs would automatically increase by 10 percent every year until the president can certify that trillions have been collected to pay for all pandemic-related damages to the U.S.\nI am persuaded by the evidence that the Chinese Communist Party created COVID-19 in their Wuhan bioweapons lab,? Brooks said in a statement.",

    "A previous study found that permanent 25 percent tariffs on China-made products imported to the U.S. market would create a million American jobs in five years.",
    "Brooks' plan, called the COVID-19 Restitution Act, would establish immediate 10 percent tariffs on all China-made products imported to the U.S. market.",
    "Most of those new jobs would be in the manufacturing sector where every one job supports an additional 7.4 jobs in supporting industries.",
    "Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rand Paul (R-KY), Americans for Legal Immigration (ALIPAC), and the National Association for Gun Rights, among others.",
    "From 2001 to 2018, U.S. free trade with China has cost Alabama at least 50,700 jobs or about 2.5 percent of the state's employment.",

    "Reps. Scott DesJarlais (R-TN) and Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) are co-sponsoring the bill.",
