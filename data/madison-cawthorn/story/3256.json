    "During his speech introducing Trump at a rally last month in Johnston County, Hines said he was running for office because, I will not sit idly by on the sidelines and watch radical, Marxist leftists destroy our country for the next generation.?\nEchoing a line of attack he has deployed against Daughtry, he continued, I also will not stand for cowardly, RINO Republicans that seek to dismantle the America First movement.?\nA few weeks earlier, in another podcast interview with Matt Beaudreau, a self-improvement guru, Hines passed along some wisdom he had absorbed during his career thus far.",

    "The question for Hines is whether Trump's endorsement and the Club for Growth's advertisements are enough to put him over the top, while Daughtry's campaign is hoping that her local bona fides and success as a lawyer will appeal to the sorts of older party stalwarts who tend to show up to vote in primary elections.",
    "I'm hoping the Republican Party in the future will not be so bogged down by the 80-year-olds sitting in Congress who want to regulate how people live their lives.?\nThose comments, which the campaign says were taken out of context,? have earned Hines a negative ad from a super PAC supporting one of his opponents.",
