    "CNN reports that North Carolina senator Thom Tillis is now backing Cawthorn's primary opponent, an extraordinary broadside against a fellow Republican from his home state.? Other GOP lawmakers, for whom the allegations of Republicans being drug users and orgy enthusiasts apparently went too far, are also said to be considering endorsing one of his primary foes...amid growing concerns that the North Carolina Republican is dragging down the entire party with his problematic behavior.? According to CNN, the most powerful Republicans in North Carolina's state legislature, Phil Berger and Tim Moore, are headlining a fundraiser for State Senator Chuck Edwards, Cawthorn's opponent, on Thursday.",

    "North Carolina senator Richard Burr, who is retiring at the end of his term, told CNN that on any given day, [Cawthorn's] an embarrassment.? Rep.

Even some in the House Freedom Caucus, whose membership includes prominent nutjobs Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, have reportedly floated the idea? of expelling him from the group.",
    "Meanwhile, it should be noted/spray painted on the steps of the Capitol that for as mad as Republicans are at Cawthorn, they reserve most of their anger for their colleagues who have the temerity to speak out against Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election, a scheme that included inciting a violent riot that left five people dead and literal shit on the halls of the Capitol building.",
    "But it's pretty incredible that his fellow Republicans are angrier at him about his most recent comments than all of the other horrible things he's done previously, and that McCarthy, who refused to strip Greene of her committee assignments despite the Georgia lawmaker endorsing Pelosi's executionamong other things!is threatening such action now.",
    "Yet none of that bothered Cawthorn's GOP colleagues quite like his making claims in a recent interview that unnamed lawmakers have invited him to orgies and done cocaine in his presence, which is apparently the one thing, other than dissing Trump, that Republicans absolutely will not tolerate.",
    "That list includes, but is not limited to: cleaning his gun during a virtual hearing about burn pits killing U.S. veterans, claiming Nancy Pelosi is an alcoholic, and calling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy a thug,? to say nothing of his apparent Hitler fetish.",
