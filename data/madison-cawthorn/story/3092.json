    "Passed in the wake of the Civil War to prevent former rebels from serving in Congress, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states: No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress  who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress  to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.?\nThe critical point to understand is that Section 3 added a qualification to hold office, one of the very few in the Constitution.",
    "Here is what the first-term congressman did, based on public reports and allegations in the challenge: In advance of the riot at the Capitol, he met with planners of the demonstrations and tweeted that the future of this Republic hinges on the actions of a solitary few  It's time to fight.? He spoke at the pre-attack rally at the Ellipse, near the White House, where he helped work the crowd into frenzy, saying the crowd had some fight in it? and that the Democrats were trying to silence them.",
    "In the hours after the riot, Mitch McConnell, then the Senate majority leader, described the attack as a failed insurrection?; one of President Trump's own lawyers in the impeachment trial stated that everyone agrees? there was a violent insurrection?; and Mr. Cawthorn himself voted for a resolution that described the attackers as insurrectionists.? He'll be hard pressed to run from that label now.",
    "If the North Carolina courts rule against him, expect Mr. Cawthorn to make a quick dash to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that it has final authority to interpret the federal constitutional term insurrection.? At that point, a conservative majority that includes three justices appointed by Donald Trump might well sympathize with Mr. Cawthorn.",
    "The indictment of Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers, and 10 other Jan. 6 participants on seditious conspiracy charges reinforces the notion that the crimes of Jan. 6 were not simply offenses of property or disorder but were attacks against the government itself, the same core idea as with insurrection.",
    "And in the aftermath of the mob violence, he extolled the rioters as political hostages? and political prisoners,? and suggested that if he knew where they were incarcerated, he would like to bust them out.?\nThe constitutional term insurrection? is less cut-and-dried than, say, whether a candidate is 25 years old.",
    "The 14th Amendment provision in question, while little known and not employed since 1919, is a close fit for his conduct around Jan. 6  as well as that of at least a half-dozen Republican colleagues who the organization spearheading the challenge, Free Speech For People, suggests will be next.",
    "Harry Litman (@harrylitman), a former U.S. attorney and deputy assistant attorney general, teaches constitutional law and national security law at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law and the University of California at San Diego Department of Political Science.",
    "As for whether Mr. Cawthorn engaged? in the insurrection, in an 1869 case, the North Carolina Supreme Court interpreted that term in Section 3 to signify voluntarily aiding the rebellion, by personal service, or by contributions  of anything that was useful or necessary? to it.",
    "Representative Madison Cawthorn has breezily dismissed a candidacy challenge filed by voters in his home state, North Carolina, seeking to bar him from re-election to the House of Representatives based on his role in the events of Jan. 6.",
    "Even before more facts are developed in the case  including a possible deposition of Mr. Cawthorn  the tweet exhorting demonstrators to fight because the future of the Republic hinges on it seems plainly designed to aid the enterprise.",
    "The North Carolina State Board of Elections will create a five-member panel composed of people from counties in the new district in which Mr. Cawthorn intends to run (which is more Republican leaning than his current one).",
    "So, if the voter challenge succeeds in establishing that Mr. Cawthorn engaged in insurrection or rebellion,? he would be as ineligible to serve in Congress as if it were revealed that he is 24 years old.",
    "Under North Carolina law, once challengers advance enough evidence to show reasonable suspicion that a candidate is not qualified, the burden shifts to the would-be candidate to demonstrate the contrary.",
    "In other contexts, courts have defined it as a usually violent uprising by a group or movement acting for the purpose of overthrowing the legitimately constituted government and seizing its powers.",
    "The plaintiffs, a spokesman from the pro-Trump Republican's office said, are comically misinterpreting and twisting the 14th Amendment for political gain.?\nMr. Cawthorn is being too quick to scoff.",
    "But the issue will have to be resolved in time for the state's primary election, currently set for May, so the normal Trump playbook of stalling until the issue becomes moot is not an option.",
    "The key question in the challenge will be whether Mr. Cawthorn's acts of support for the Jan. 6 uprising rise to the level of engaging in an insurrection against the government.",
    "The others are that members of the House must be at least 25, a U.S. citizen for seven years and live in the state the individual represents.",
    "The board's decision will be delayed until after a state court rules on a separate redistricting challenge in North Carolina.",
    "The panel's decision could be appealed to the entire State Board of Elections, and after that to the state's court system.",
    "That accurately describes the collective pro-Trump effort to undermine the certification of the November 2020 election.",
    "It is no different in this respect from the qualification that the president be at least 35 and a natural-born citizen.",
    "The challengers have a strong case, and Mr. Cawthorn would be foolish to take it lightly.",
    "But while it may be rare, the North Carolina voter challenge is no joke.",
    "He is also host of the podcast Talking Feds."
