    "Other evidence the groups submitted included noting how Smith has lived in Cawthorn's home in Hendersonville, North Carolina, for free ever since the freshman congressman took office.",
    "The filings also suggest that Cawthorn is engaging in an improper relationship with Smith which is \"separate and apart from the professional relationship\" of employer and employee.",
    "Speaking to DailyMail.com, David Wheeler, the co-founder of Fire Madison Cawthorn, said they have been attempting to hold the congressman into account for a year.",
