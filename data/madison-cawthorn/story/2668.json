    "The people of mountains are ready for a change,? Edwards continued, arguing that conservative voters in western North Carolina have tired of a lawmaker who he claims has spent his short tenure on Capitol Hill seeking political stardom.?\nWith his combative personality and telegenic good looks, the then-24-year-old Cawthorn became a favorite of grassroots conservatives nationally in 2020, soon after defeating the preferred candidate of the GOP establishment, and former President Donald Trump, in an open primary in North Carolina's 11th District.",
    "If you're state Sen. Chuck Edwards, running against Rep. Madison Cawthorn in North Carolina's 11th Congressional District, you focus on meat-and-potato problems and, more specifically, the mountains.?\nI'm running because the 14-month experiment here in District 11 has concluded, and it's time to send someone to Washington, D.C., to represent the people of the mountains who has a deep history of accomplishment in life and in business and in serving the people of the district,? Edwards told the Washington Examiner in an interview.",
    "I have a history accomplishing things for North Carolinians that are important to conservative-minded people,? said Edwards, 61, who outside of his work in the North Carolina Senate has a range of business interests that include owning a half-dozen McDonald's restaurants.",
    "Cawthorn, who quickly aligned himself with Trump, basked in the attention and sought to leverage his newfound fame to become a Republican power player who could bully party leaders and influence the outcome of primaries across the state and across the country.",
    "And standing in the way in his bid for a second term in what is quickly becoming one of the most closely watched GOP primaries of the spring are two formidable candidates: Michele Woodhouse, a former party official in the district, and Edwards.",
    "His strategy for winning the nomination, or at least holding Cawthorn below 30% of the vote and forcing a runoff, is to focus on the controversies surrounding the congressman that are piling up almost by the day.",
    "\"Our biggest challenge right now is time and introducing voters outside of my [state] Senate district to my bio, my background, and my set of accomplishments,\" Edwards conceded.",
    "But in this case, it symbolizes the heart of the case Edwards is building to convince voters to throw out an incumbent who until recently seemed bulletproof at home.",
    "I've actually achieved or passed legislation to improve election integrity.?\nNo one else in this race can say they've done those things.",
    "But after several run-ins with the law and fresh allegations of insider trading, the congressman now appears legitimately vulnerable.",
    "That line from Edwards, or something similar, has no doubt been uttered a million times before by a million other politicians.",
    "I have a track record of doing those things in Raleigh, and I'm confident I can get those things done in Washington, D.C.?",
    "Do you want a grown-up who has been successful in business and delivered on the legislation for the district?",
    "Or do you want a 26-year-old, troubled kid who talks a lot but doesn't get anything substantive done?",
    "Cawthorn is still favored to win his May 17 primary, Republican insiders in North Carolina said.",
    "Just In...\nWhat do you do if you're trying to oust a grassroots phenom in a Republican primary?",
    "\"Of course, resources is a very important element in introducing a candidate to the voters.\"",
    "It's unclear if Edwards is going to have the resources to put himself in a position to win.",
    "I'm the only person in this race who has balanced government budgets,? he said.",
    "All of the candidates in this race talk about those things,? Edwards added.",
    "That's how Edwards is attempting to frame this contest.",
    "I've passed legislation to outlaw sanctuary cities.",
    "Workhorse or show horse?"
