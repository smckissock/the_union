    "In their original filing seeking Greene's disqualification, attorneys for her challengers repeatedly pointed to the fact that she referred to January 6, 2021 as \"our 1776 moment\" before the Capitol riot, arguing this phrase was used by others \"as a codeword for violence in the run-up to January 6.\"",

    "Bopp Jr. also said the lawsuit was part of a nationwide effort to prevent voters choosing candidates they wanted, with elections instead being decided by \"bureaucrats, judges, lawyers and clever legal arguments.\"",
