    "After she resigned the Alaska governorship in 2009 with one of the most bizarre speeches in the history of American politics (completing a full term would be the quitter's way out,? she said), she moved on to a less than entirely successful career as a media personality, cycling through numerous unsuccessful TV shows and failed enterprises (if you don't remember the Sarah Palin Channel,? which cost only $99.95 a year, don't blame yourself).",
    "In a statement announcing her candidacy, she explained why she's running: As I've watched the far left destroy the country, I knew I had to step up and join the fight.?\nThe political kinship between Palin and Trump is obvious, and they share a similar kind of magnetism, in which the people who loathe them find them just as fascinating to watch as the people who love them.",

    "He took over the party in a way she never could, not least because Republicans wanted a man to champion the patriarchy, and one who would do so with a kind of venom that Palin didn't quite manage.",
    "It's brimming with Palinesque figures, halfwit politicians whose purpose is garnering media appearances rather than anything so dull as governing, and who want nothing more than to Own the Libs.",
    "Is Palin going to stand out in a Republican caucus alongside the likes of Reps. Madison Cawthorn (N.C.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Lauren Boebert (Colo.), and Matt Gaetz (Fla.)?",
    "So while Palin in 2008 grasped the attention of a party dominated by establishment figures like McCain and Mitt Romney, she couldn't seize control of it in the way Trump did.",
    "It has no goals, it can win no practical victories, it can never improve the lives of the people it claims to speak for, and it does nothing but justify its own continuation.",
    "There are people from small towns who aren't narcissistic nincompoops and who have a genuine policy agenda they can make an argument for; she was not among them.",
    "), and as she attempts to go from C-list political celebrity back to public office, she finds a Republican Party that has in many ways been remade in her image.",
