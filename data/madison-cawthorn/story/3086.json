    "Opt in to email updates from Daily Kos Elections\nSponsored by: Daily Kos Elections\nIn their 217-page decision that adjudicated claims in three related cases, that trio of judges concluded that plaintiffs were \"substantially likely\" to satisfy the test used by the Supreme Court to determine when, under Section Two of the VRA, a redistricting plan \"provides 'less opportunity' for racial minorities  'to elect representatives of their choice'\" compared to white voters.",
    "Cooper would later say that he knew two months before Election Day that both he and Sasser would go down, and he was right: Thompson beat him in a 61-39 landslide as Frist was also unseating Sasser by double digits, which made this the last time that a state's entire Senate delegation changed hands on the same night until last year's Democratic sweep in Georgia.",
    "Leading Off\n? AL Redistricting: A panel of three federal judges blocked Alabama's new congressional map from being used in this year's elections in a ruling on Monday evening, holding that Republican lawmakers had likely violated the Voting Rights Act by failing to draw a second district where Black voters can elect their preferred candidates.",
    "He often opposed Nancy Pelosi in speakership elections (though he backed her in 2021 for the first time in years), and he voted with the Trump administration nearly 40% of the time in 2017 and 2018.\nCooper, though, seemed completely safe at home, especially after his brother, John Cooper, was overwhelmingly elected mayor of Nashville in 2019.",
    "Weprin suffered a severe stroke in early 1994 and Silver quickly moved to position himself to succeed him, with the Village Voice writing, \"With all the morbid agility of someone scouring the Times obituaries for a vacant apartment, the state assembly wasted no time stepping over Speaker Saul Weprin's comatose body to elect his successor.\"",
    "As WCIA noted last week, though, it was Pritzker, the man Irvin is hoping to beat, who deployed the Guard to Aurora and other communities in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder; a state National Guard spokesperson also confirmed that, while mayors may make this request of the governor, they don't have the authority to call the Guard in.",
    "Finally, said the court, Black Alabamians have less \"opportunity to elect\" their preferred candidates when considering the \"totality of the circumstances\"an inquiry that led the judges to consider the state's \"well-documented, pervasive, and sordid history of racial discrimination,\" in the words of still another expert for the plaintiffs.",
    "To remedy this violation of the Voting Rights Act, the court ordered lawmakers to draw two districts where Black voters either make up a majority or \"have an opportunity to elect a representative of their choice\"meaning that a sufficient number of white voters are likely to \"cross over\" to support Black voters' preferred candidate.",
    "Starbuck also attracted some attention last month when North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn brought him onto the House floor, a move that likely violated the chamber's rules; an unnamed source told The Hill at the time that the far-right congressman lied to security and claimed that Starbuck was one of his staffers.",
    "Cuellar also put out some new media of his own on Tuesday: a homemade-looking video in which he stands in front of what he says is his childhood home, insists he hasn't done anything wrong in spite of his home and campaign HQ getting raided by the FBI last week, and says he'll continue to run for re-election.",
    "In particular, two of their experts, both of whom the court termed \"highly credible,\" drew multiple illustrative maps to demonstrate that Alabama's Black population is \"sufficiently geographically compact\" to allow the creation of a second \"reasonably configured\" district with a voting-age Black majority.",
    "? NY Redistricting: As expected, a final Tuesday deadline for New York's bipartisan redistricting commission to approve new congressional and legislative maps has come and gone without any agreement being reached, officially handing the task of crafting new districts to the Democratic-run legislature.",
    "Given Alabama's racial polarization, however, such crossover voting is likely to be limited at best, prompting the judges to advise the legislature that \"any remedial plan will need to include two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.\"",
    "While there are countless ways to draw such a seat, the expert plans focused on uniting the state's \"Black Belt,\" a predominantly African American string of poor rural counties that run across the lower tier of the state; under the GOP's now-blocked map, they were split between three districts.",
    "Three more Republicans also told Axios last week that they were considering: former state House Speaker Beth Harwell, who took fourth in the 2018 primary for governor; Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles; and attorney Kurt Winstead, who is a retired brigadier general in the Tennessee National Guard.",
    "On the Democratic side, community activist Odessa Kelly entered the primary against Cooper back in April and sounds like she plans to continue her campaign: Kelly tweeted Tuesday, \"[P]eople-powered movements in this state have been building power for years and no map is going to slow us down.\"",
    "Majority Leader Michael Bragman decided to test the speaker's power in 2000 when he tried to rally members unhappy with the leadership, but Silver quickly responded by stripping Bragman of his title and demoting his allies while threatening to do the same to anyone else who joined in the coup.",
    "The judges specifically took note of the conclusion of a third plaintiff's expert that, in recent races pitting a Black candidate versus a white one, \"Black support for the Black-preferred candidate always exceeded 90% and white support for the Black-preferred candidate never exceeded 12.6%.\"",
    "The Democrat responded to Thompson's high-profile red pickup truck ride across the state by labeling him a \"Gucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey Pouponspreading millionaire Washington special-interest lobbyist,\" but he just couldn't puncture Thompson's folksy image.",
    "Senate\n? CT-Sen, CT-Gov: Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal is far from a top-tier Republican target in dark blue Connecticut, but CT Insider's Dan Haar reports that Republican fundraiser Leora Levy, who served as Donald Trump's ambassador to Chile, is considering taking him on.",
    "Cooper quickly established himself as anything but a loyal vote for the Democratic leadership by opposing the Equal Rights Amendment and supporting the Reagan administration's MX missile project, but he also took some stances that could have harmed him in his rural seat.",
    "Bragman still took his case to the floor where, as The New York Times wrote, he argued the speaker had \"stifled debate on major issues, reduced rank-and-file lawmakers to bit players and given powerful lobbyists too much say in the day-to-day affairs of the chamber.\"",
    "Cooper sought a promotion in 1994 when he campaigned in the special Senate election to succeed Vice President Al Gore (appointed Democratic Sen. Harlan Mathews did not run), but he faced a tough race in a historically Democratic state that was moving to the right.",
    "A few Republicans already started to express interest in running in the August primary for the revamped 5th District, which now includes several dark red areas near Nashville, even before Cooper made his decision public, though one person already has a head start.",
    "? RI-02: An aide to Providence City Council President John Igliozzi has acknowledged that he's interested in entering the Democratic primary for this open seat, while Democratic state Rep. Joseph Solomon has also acknowledged he's thinking about competing here.",
    "With Silver completely safe at home and Democrats firmly in charge of the Assembly (it and the GOP-run Senate dutifully agreed on maps that maintained the status quo in each chamber), he was assured to keep his place in the room as long as his caucus was happy.",
    "Cooper himself spent that cycle as one of the most prominent opponents of President Bill Clinton's healthcare reform plan, and he sponsored an alternative bill he nicknamed \"Clinton Lite\" that was very friendly to the insurance and healthcare industries.",
    "Thompson himself initially ran a chaotic campaign and even talked about dropping out in May, but the actor proved to be a strong contender who, despite his lobbyist background, persuasively argued he had the anti-establishment credentials Cooper lacked.",
    "So it was a surprise when the congressman won his primary the next year by a surprisingly modest 57-40 against Keeda Haynes, a public defender who was running an underfunded campaign against him from the left, in what proved to be his last campaign.",
    "? TN Redistricting: Both chambers of Tennessee's Republican-run legislature have now passed the GOP's new congressional redistricting plan, which chops up the city of Nashvillepreviously kept whole in a single districtbetween three separate seats.",
    "While the high court's far-right majority has sought to eviscerate the Voting Rights Act at every turn, it bears noting that this decision was authored by two judges appointed by Donald Trump and one originally named to the bench by Ronald Reagan.",
    "Central to plaintiffs' argument is the fact that Black Alabamians make up about 27% of the state but are only able to elect the candidate of their choice (generally speaking, a Black Democrat) in one of the state's seven districts, or just 14%.",
    "Silver spent his 21 years as head of the assembly as one of the so-called \"three men in a room,\" an elite group consisting of the governor, speaker, and state Senate majority leader that together essentially decided the state's major policies.",
    "While he lost a 1974 primary for the City Council by less than 100 votes, he won the nomination two years later for a safely Democratic Assembly seat in Lower Manhattan that included turf once represented by Alexander Hamilton and Al Smith.",
    "The court extensively recapped this sad pastwhich isn't even pastfrom the violent terror whites deployed to disenfranchise Blacks during reconstruction to legislative efforts to suppress Black voting power all the way up to the present day.",
    "The Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, Stephen Wolf, Daniel Donner, and Carolyn Fiddler, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, James Lambert, David Beard, and Arjun Jaikumar.",
    "There's no word if Klarides, who would be in for a difficult gubernatorial primary against 2018 nominee Bob Stefanowski, is at all interested in taking on the senator, though Haar writes she \"declined to comment on a possible run for U.S.",
    "By contrast, she charges that her opponent in the March 1 Democratic primary, Rep. Henry Cuellar, \"holds thousand-dollar-a-plate fundraisers, taking from the drug and insurance companies charging high pricesor even denying us care.\"",
    "? PA Redistricting: Pennsylvania's Republican-run state Senate passed a new congressional map on a party-line vote on Monday, following similar action earlier this month by their counterparts in the state House, but Democratic Gov.",
    "? MO Redistricting: The bipartisan commission handling redistricting for Missouri's state House has reached a unanimous compromise on a new map, despite a party-line split last month that prompted it to release two separate plans.",
    "Cooper quickly emerged as a leading candidate in the crowded race even though he hadn't previously represented any of the city, but he faced serious opposition from state Rep. John Arriola and Davidson County Sheriff Gayle Ray.",
    "? TN-05: Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper announced Tuesday that he would retire, a declaration that came one day after Tennessee's Republican legislature passed a new gerrymander designed to turn his 5th Congressional District red.",
    "Cooper's existing seat, which includes all of Nashville, backed Joe Biden 60-37; however, by splitting the city between the 5th, 6th, and 7th Districts, the GOP has created a new 5th that would have favored Donald Trump 54-43.",
    "Because the case was heard by a three-judge panel, federal law dictates that any appeal go directly to the Supreme Court, which is obligated to take up the case; unlike in most situations, it cannot decline to hear an appeal.",
    "Cooper moved to Nashville afterwards and spent the next several years as an investment banker and instructor at Vanderbilt University, but Thompson's 2002 retirement indirectly gave him an opportunity to return to the House.",
    "Silver's guilty verdict was overturned thanks to the precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court decision that made it harder to convict public officials for corruption, but his retrial ended with the same verdict as the first.",
    "Obituaries\n? Former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who ran the lower chamber from 1994 until he stepped down in 2015 months before he was convicted on corruption charges, died Monday at the age of 77.",
    "House\n? CA-09: Politico reports that former Trump aide Steven Cheung is considering running against Democratic Rep. Josh Harder, who is seeking re-election in a Stockton-based seat that would have favored Joe Biden 55-43.",
    "Section Two also requires challengers to show that voting is racially polarized, meaning that Black voters tend to support the same candidate while whites typically vote as bloc to defeat Black voters' preferred choice.",
    "It also didn't help Cooper that national Democrats were more committed to aiding Sen. Jim Sasser, who was in a tough general election battle of his own against physician Bill Frist, than in helping him in the special.",
    "The candidate, who was identified as \"Ruben Ramon Ramirez\" in 2012, said he wasn't trying to confuse voters into thinking he was the incumbent and argued he'd long used \"Hinojosa\" and \"Ramirez\" interchangeably.",
    "The departure of Cooper, who has been one of the most prominent moderate Democrats for some time, ends a decades-long career that included two stints in the House representing two very different constituencies.",
    "? IL-01: Nonprofit head Jonathan Swain, who is a former chairman of the Chicago Zoning Board of Appeals, has filed with the FEC for a potential bid to succeed his fellow Democrat, retiring Rep. Bobby Rush.",
    "A similar commission in charge of redrawing the state Senate's districts, however, failed to produce any maps at all in December and missed a final deadline earlier this week to agree on a single proposal.",
    "Proportionality is only one part of the inquiry, though, and Section Two in fact specifies that there's no right to representation for members of racial minorities in equal proportion to their population.",
    "? GA-07: Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux has earned an endorsement from Sam Nunn, who represented Georgia in the Senate from 1972 to 1997, in her May Democratic primary showdown with fellow incumbent Lucy McBath.",
    "The plan would target Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids by splitting the Kansas City area in order to make her 3rd District redder, taking it from a 54-44 win for Joe Biden to a 51-47 Biden margin instead.",
    "Ray, who had the support of EMILY's List, ran ads arguing that Cooper's 1994 healthcare plan wouldn't have provided essential services to women, while the NRA backed Arriola over both Cooper and Ray.",
    "While Cooper never again gave his party as much trouble during his second stint in Congress as he did during the 1994 fight, he once again resumed his role as a thorn in the side for his leadership.",
    "Mike DeWine 46-38 in the May Republican primary, which would be a huge upset in a race that has been largely overshadowed by Team Red's wide-open and already very expensive Senate nomination fight.",
    "After touting his service in Afghanistan as a civilian intelligence analyst, the candidate declares, \"Pritzker's leftist agenda is literally killing us, turning parts of Illinois into a war zone.\"",
    "Bill Lee has yet to sign the map, the gerrymandering has already had its intended effect, as veteran Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper immediately announced his retirement following the map's approval.",
    "The younger Cooper worked as an attorney before he sought elected office in 1982 campaigning for the sprawling 4th District, which included rural communities to the south and east of Nashville.",
    "Community activist Odessa Kelly launched a campaign to deny him renomination months later, but he ultimately retired rather than try to defend a seat that was now gerrymandered against him.",
    "(The region originally earned its name from its dark, rich topsoil, which inspired white slave owners to build cotton plantations there, in turn leading to its large Black population.)",
    "The congressman faced a tough fight against Republican Fred Thompson, and though an early poll gave Cooper a 37-16 lead, his prospects plunged as the GOP gained strength nationally.",
    "The challenger told his colleagues, \"Member after member is forced to go to the speaker to ask for anything, from paper clips to chairmanships, from parking passes to staff needs.",

    "Sullivan, meanwhile, uses his spot to echo Donald Trump and blame Pritzker for crime in Chicago, which was a perennial issue in city politics long before Pritzker was elected.",

    "? MN-Gov: Former Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek has acknowledged he's interested in seeking the Republican nomination, though he's denied that he's made up his mind yet.",

    "? KS Redistricting: A committee in Kansas' Republican-run House advanced a congressional map previously passed by the state Senate in a party-line vote on Monday.",
    "The congressman backed abortion rights, voted in favor of gun safety measures, and loudly criticized the tobacco industry in a region where it held immense sway.",
