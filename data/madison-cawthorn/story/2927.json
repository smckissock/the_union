    "That notorious dirty trickster Roger Stone has involved himself as a validator of Cawthorn's claims also suggests that this situation may involve some intra-party power plays, and isn't just a matter of one of the dumber party members getting a little out of hand while trying to titillate the right-wing audience.",

    "Lest there be any doubt that these bills are designed to pander to bug-eyed conspiracy theorists, Republicans have been openly claiming that these bills are meant to stop pedophiles from \"grooming\" children in schools.",
    "Republican members of Congress, apparently unaware of the dangers of the Streisand effect, failed to heed the \"ignore it\" advice when known crazy liars say wild stuff about you on conspiracy theory-oriented websites.",

    "Cawthorn, in his full QAnon-style \"can you believe this\" voice, raved about how high profile Republicans have invited him to \"a sexual get together at one of our homes\" and that he's seen them snort cocaine.",
    "Much of the astroturfed \"school board\" strategy the GOP is stirring up is aimed directly at the crowd that loves chattering all day long about their fantasies of Satanic blood-drinking pedophiles.",
    "Of course, as anyone who has read about the parties at Steve Bannon's D.C. townhouse can imagine, a big difference is that what Cawthorn said is far likelier to have a grain of truth to it.",
    "More critically, the research shows that the conspiracy theory is a good recruitment tool for the GOP, as it's attracting people who were previously apolitical or even had liberal opinions.",
    "The podcast is hosted by \"Warrior Poet Society,\" which is exactly what you're imagining: An unintentionally campy website rife with forbidden erotic yearning sublimated into gun worship.",

    "Trump is already using facile accusations of \"RINO\" and \"woke\" to punish Republicans for perceived infractions like expressing skepticism of his election-stealing schemes.",
    "It converts those folks to the idea that Donald Trump  and ergo, the larger GOP  is somehow going to save humanity from the blood-drinking Satanic pedophiles.",
    "The result is an avalanche of anti-trans and anti-gay bills aimed at public schools, with Florida's \"don't say gay\" bill getting the most attention.",
    "Certainly, Cawthorn's accusations sound downright quaint next to all these lurid QAnon fantasies of Satantism and sexual violence towards children.",
    "It's not just the Jackson hearing and the hours of Senate Republicans crawling each other to get clips of pedophilia insinuations onto Fox News.",
    "Their hubris leads them, however, to falsely assume that they can keep a firm hand on how these stories spread and who gets implicated.",
    "And not just online, either, where \"ok groomer\" has become the favored phrase right-wing trolls fling at supporters of LGBTQ rights.",
    "But, as this Cawthorn debacle shows, that community's addiction to titillating tales of political debauchery needs constant feeding.",

    "But, like all bullies, Republicans proved themselves to be incredibly thin-skinned this week.",
    "New polling from PRRI shows that 22% of Americans subscribe to at least some QAnon beliefs.",
    "Numerous talking heads on the network accused the corporation of \"sexualizing children.\"",
    "But it also highlights a larger problem that is facing the GOP in the Donald Trump era.",
    "The next day, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis endorsed Cawthorn's primary opponent.",
