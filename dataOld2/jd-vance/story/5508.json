    "It also banned the QAnon conspiracy movement for similar reasons, saying that even QAnon content which didnt itself call for violence could still be tied to different forms of real world harm.?\nIn theory, the massacre in Buffalo could mark a similar moment of truth for the great replacement theory, which claims that white people are being replaced? by non-white groups, and which Gendron referred to repeatedly in a 180-page manifesto posted online before the spree.",
    "Im trying not to be a pessimist, but if the past is any indication, I dont know how successful theyre going to be, or how much effort a lot of these companies are going to put in it,? Segal said, adding that similar cycles of corporate reform played out after the Christchurch shooting as well as the 2019 El Paso shooting that targeted Latinos and the 2017 white nationalist Unite the Right? rally in Charlottesville, Va.",
    "That will maybe make it more difficult for these platforms to take action.?\nWendy Via, co-founder and president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said that because social media platforms often treat the powerful and well-connected with kids gloves, Carlson  and other ideologically aligned politicians such as J.D.",
    "Ultimately, do those changes that they make in response to tragedy have a lasting impact??\nThat figures as influential as Carlson are pushing the ideology behind this latest tragedy may discourage platform companies from attempting to combat its spread, but it shouldnt, Segal said.",
    "Because theres already a perception among some conservatives that social media companies are biased against right-wing content  a notion that research refutes  cracking down on great replacement theory-related posts could put the platforms in politically dicey waters, Radsch said.",
    "Now, as the predominantly Black neighborhood that suspected killer Payton Gendron targeted is left reeling, whether those platforms allow their users to promulgate the racist great replacement theory? that appears to have motivated him has become a matter of public safety.",
    "On most of the big social platforms, hate speech thats directed at a specific group, as well as related threats of violence, would typically already constitute a terms of service violation, said Courtney Radsch, a fellow at UCLAs Institute for Technology, Law and Policy.",
    "The fact that the great replacement is not just becoming ubiquitous on some fringe extremist space but also in our public discussion,? he said, suggests that theres more of a reason for them to take a position on [moderating it], not less.?",
    "After the 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, that targeted multiple mosques, Facebook took action immediately? to deprive great replacement theory advocates of a platform, including the group Generation Identity, Via said.",
    "Vance and Jim Jordan  do not get moderated the way that anybody else does.?\nGreat replacement content is going to proliferate out of control because the ones that are pushing it? enjoy preferential treatment, Via said.",
    "(Jennifer S. Altman / For The Times)\nThe Buffalo, N.Y., mass shooting that claimed 10 lives Saturday was an event shaped by, and for, internet platforms, including message boards and streaming and social media sites.",
    "But its not clear that thats how things will actually play out, given the political pressure weighing on social media companies and the embrace of similar rhetoric by some of the rights most prominent figures.",
    "Representatives from Twitch, Facebook and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment as to what specific strategies or rules they use to moderate great replacement theory content.",

    "They go from zero to 20. They need to go from zero to 100, not halfway to it, but it takes people dying to get them to move [even] incrementally.",
    "But the problem, Via said, is that such efforts happen at a drip-drip pace and play out unevenly across different social networks.",
    "What the Buffalo shooting could do, she said, is give tech companies some latitude to more aggressively enforce those rules.",
    "It takes these big things to get them to take action,? she said, but even then, they dont go from zero to 100.",
