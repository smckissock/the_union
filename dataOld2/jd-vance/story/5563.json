Mark] Kelly in November.?\nThis is not the first time Masters words were twisted by the media this month, as the Arizona Mirror published an article stating in a headline that the Republican candidate wanted to allow states to ban contraception use.? This was in reference to the Masters campaign website stating that he would only vote for federal judges who understand that Roe and Griswold and Casey were wrongly decided, and that there is no constitutional right to abortion.? The websites referral to Griswold is in regards to the U.S. Supreme Court 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut, which ruled that U.S. couples could use contraceptives without government interference.",
