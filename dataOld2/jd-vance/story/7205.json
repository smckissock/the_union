    "Indeed, Mastriano played an instrumental role in pushing forward Trump's conspiracy theories about the 2020 election  he began his campaign by leading an effort to overturn Pennsylvania's 2020 election results and attended the Stop the Steal rally on Jan. 6, 2021, where he breached a police barricade outside the Capitol building during the insurrection.",
    "Candidly, many establishment Republicans would likely welcome the chance to put Trump behind them, as these members understand that their political prospects in 2022 and 2024 will be in jeopardy if the party continues to focus on Trump's backward-looking priorities and conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, rather than on an agenda for the future.",
    "Vance's upset win in the Ohio Republican primary for U.S. Senate earlier this month  due in large part to Trump's endorsement  the outcomes of Tuesday's primary contests indicate that Donald Trump will remain a dominant figure in Republican politics through at least 2024, and could very well become the GOP presidential nominee.",
    "But perhaps the most closely watched primary on Tuesday was the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, where Trump's support for celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz markedly boosted Oz's chances against David McCormick, a former George W. Bush staffer and hedge fund CEO.",
    "A forward-looking, moderate Republican agenda that offers solutions where Democrats have failed to provide them  while avoiding pandering to the party's extreme fringes and relitigating past grievances  is essential for the party's prospects in 2022, 2024 and beyond.",
    "Indeed, Trump's ability to propel Oz  a TV doctor with questionable conservative credentials, who was polling well-behind McCormick weeks ago  to a position where he is within reach of winning a statewide Republican primary is evidence of Trump's enduring influence.",
    "To be sure, Trump did endure a loss on Tuesday night, as his efforts to support the re-election of U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who has been involved in numerous public scandals and is highly controversial even within his own party, did not result in a win.",
    "Even if Oz does end up losing by a razor-thin margin, given the closeness of the race and Trump's demonstrable impact, we can reasonably expect that McCormick will vie for Trump's backing in the general election in order to turn out the Republican base.",
    "In the North Carolina Republican primary for U.S. Senate, all candidates jockeyed for the former president's support at the outset of the campaign  understandably so, as Trump's backing of Congressman Ted Budd propelled Budd to a landslide victory.",
    "Voters, and particularly swing-voters, are focused on addressing the challenges of today  inflation, crime, energy costs and now, a catastrophic shortage of baby formula  not fighting about alleged voter fraud in the last election.",
    "In the gubernatorial primary, the Trump-backed far-right candidate Doug Mastriano was able to drub his opponents and win 44% of the vote in a 3-way race, even in the face of staunch opposition from the Republican establishment.",
    "While Trump only officially endorsed Mastriano, who is currently a state senator, a few days before the primary election, the organizing principle of Mastriano's campaign was essentially showing fealty to the former president.",
    "Ultimately, the results of Tuesday's primaries  even if McCormick is able to squeak out a victory over Oz in Pennsylvania  are telling of Trump's primacy within the party, much to the Republican rank and file's chagrin.",
    "The results of three Republican primary races held last week  for North Carolina U.S. Senate, Pennsylvania governor and Pennsylvania U.S. Senate  make clear that the Republican Party is still Donald Trump's party.",
    "In each race, the Trump-backed candidates, who were by no means a shoe-in for the nomination at the outset of the campaign, either won or are presently poised to win, beating out establishment-backed candidates.",
    "But if Tuesday's election results are any indication, Republicans won't be making this strategic pivot anytime soon, as the party cannot seem to escape the pervasive political powerhouse that is Donald Trump.",
    "Even though Oz may be edged out by McCormick in the end, the very fact that Oz is in this position is a testament to Donald Trump's power over the GOP, even in a swing state like Pennsylvania.",
    "As a result, state Sen. Chuck Edwards, the winner of the race, will now likely have to genuflect to Trump ahead of the general election campaign in order to turn out the base.",
    "Prior to Trump's endorsement of Oz, McCormick held a 6 point lead over Oz, 27% to 21% in a crowded Republican field, according to an Emerson poll at the time.",
    "Simply put, relitigating the 2020 election is the worst thing the Republicans can or should do if they are trying to build a strong base going forward.",
    "Trump endorsed two fringe candidates for governor and U.S. Senate  and now, at least one, and potentially both, will win their respective elections.",
    "That being said, Cawthorn clearly benefited from Trump's endorsement, having only lost his primary by 2 points.",
    "While the race is still too close to call, as I write this, Oz maintains a slight lead of 1,200 votes.",
    "The two statewide Republican primaries in Pennsylvania are also proof of Trump's remarkable sway.",
    "Budd won with 58.6% of the vote, compared to 24.6% for the runner-up candidate.",
    "A daily roundup of the day's top opinion and editorial pieces.",
    "Douglas Schoen is a Democratic political consultant.",
