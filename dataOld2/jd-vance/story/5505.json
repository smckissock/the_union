    "The paranoid style,? according to Krugman, has been taking over the Republican Party,? including Republican elites?  who used to push back against conspiracy theories but now cheerfully embrace them whenever it seems politically expedient.?\nKrugman explains, The rise of supply-side economics coincided with the rise of movement conservatism  an interlocking network of elected officials, media organizations, think tanks and lobbying firms.",
    "reigned supreme, President Ronald Reagans economic policy was described as both trickle-down economics? and voodoo economics.? Reagan and his allies believed that when millionaires and billionaires are given major tax cuts and become even more prosperous, they inevitably share their economics gains with the middle class and the poor  a school of economic thought that Krugman rejected when he was younger and still rejects in 2022.",
    "As far as I know, however, diatribes about the evils of high marginal tax rates havent inspired any acts of domestic terrorism.?\nLaw enforcement officials believe that the May 14 shooter in Buffalo was inspired by far-right white nationalist doctrine and the racist conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement.",
    "They may have signed up to promote low taxes and a weaker safety net, but most of the party immediately went MAGA when the winds shifted.?\nThe columnist cites Vance and one-time Paul Ryan protg? Stefanik as examples of former Trump critics in the GOP who flip flopped and went MAGA? because it was expedient.",
    "As has been widely reported, the suspect accused of fatally shooting 10 people in Buffalo is a devotee of Replacement theory, which claims that sinister elites  especially Jews, of course  are deliberately bringing in immigrants to displace and disempower White Americans,? Krugman explains.",
    "So were the men charged with massacres at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018 and an El Paso Walmart in 2019.?\nKrugman continues, Replacement theory used to be a fringe doctrine, but these days, in at best thinly disguised form, it is attracting significant mainstream support within the GOP.",
    "In his first post-vacation column, published on May 16, Krugman has two observations about the American right: (1) voodoo economics? is still a failure, and (2) at least the Reagan Republicans who promoted voodoo economics? during the 1980s didnt encourage violence.",
    "As The Times has documented, Tucker Carlsons Fox News show has amplified the doctrine more than 400 times.?\nThe Great Replacement theory, Krugman notes, has also been promoted by well-known Republicans ranging from Rep. Elise Stefanik to Hillbilly Elegy? author J.D.",
    "When Paul Krugman was on vacation in late April and the first half of May, he actually acted like he was on vacation; the liberal economist and New York Times columnist didnt do much tweeting, and there was a two-week gap between columns.",
    "The Republicans who control Mississippi, a poor state with desperately underfunded educational programs thats closing hospitals, recently moved to boost the states economy by cutting taxes.",
    "Krugman writes, It was shocking, at the time, when a crank economic doctrine  the claim that tax cuts pay for themselves  became, in effect, the official Republican party line.",
    "But Krugman had a lot to talk about after he returned from vacation, including the mass shooting at a Buffalo, New York supermarket on Saturday, May 14.",
    "What we now know is that the embrace of crank economics presaged the general moral collapse of the Republican establishment,? Krugman observes.",
    "Many were careerists: people happy to serve as apparatchiks, following whatever the party line happened to be at the moment.",
    "This collapse opened the door for paranoia and conspiracy theorists of all kinds  and the consequences have been deadly.",
    "The deadly attack was carried out in a heavily Black area of Buffalo, and most of the people shot were African-American.",
    "There is, I would argue, a direct line from the Laffer curve, to January 6, (2021) to Buffalo.?",
    "Back in the days when Madonna, Prince, Duran Duran and Run-D.M.C.",
    "And voodoo economics continues to do real damage to this day.",
    "Vance, the GOP nominee in Ohios 2022 U.S. Senate race.",
    "And this mainstream acceptance helps it spread.",
    "Who was attracted to this movement?"
