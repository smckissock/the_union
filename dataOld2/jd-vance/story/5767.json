Gibbons told NBC 4 In Columbus in August, when asked in an interview about his crusade against wokeism.?\nI think they were just subject to the lack of technology and their place in the world, because physical labor was so important to making a living.?\nLater in the interview, Gibbons criticized his only female opponent, Timken, as someone who had barely worked,? suggesting she merely married into money.",
    "Youre going have to talk to Bernie as to why he thinks he made an offer.?\nAs part of his efforts to focus attention on the teams name change  which rubbed many local fans the wrong way  Moreno also told the television station he had an idea to issue a digital currency called Tribecoin? to allow people in Northeast Ohio to own part of the team.?\nTwitter isnt a website\nMoreno went through a phase last summer when he kept going on Twitter to troll Rep. Tim Ryan, the now-Democratic nominee for Senate.",
    "In an ad, Timken talked about her male opponents inadequacies,? something that was widely understood to be a veiled reference to the size of their genitalia, invoking memories of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) insulting Trumps small hands? in 2016.\nWe all know guys who overcompensate for their inadequacies, and that description fits the guys in the Senate race to a T,? Timken said with a slight smirk, standing next to photos on easels of Gibbons, Vance and Mandel.",
    "Standing in a cornfield, warning of the Gestapo\nWhile out driving between campaign stops in western Ohio in September, Mandel became so incensed about President Joe Bidens mandate that large employers require vaccines or COVID-19 testing, he pulled over in the dark and filmed a video in a cornfield about how Biden was trampling freedoms.",
    "You watch what happens.?\nGibbons: P----!?\nMandel: You watch what happens.?\nBoth men subsequently denied calling the other a p----.?

    "As examples of childless cat ladies, Vance pointed to Vice President Kamala Harris (who has stepchildren); progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the youngest woman in Congress; and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who announced a month later he and his husband had adopted infant twins.",
    "The inadequacies of Timkens male opponents\nFormer state party chair Jane Timken leaned into the fact she was the only woman in the race, frequently starting her answers during debates and interviews with As a mother ? and adopting the campaign slogan of mom on a mission.?\nIn February, she went further.",
    "Timken spent months accusing Gibbons of sexism, first calling on him to apologize for perpetuating an offensive stereotype? and suggesting he may be living in the 1950s.?\nMonths later, at a debate in March, Gibbons clarified that women were probably oppressed? when they didnt have a right to vote.",
    "Were effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that theyve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too,? Vance told Tucker Carlson at the time.",
    "The election was unrivaled in the number of times the candidates debased themselves for attention, said something absurdly provocative or committed an act of epic buffoonery, perpetuating a spiral of attacks against each other that generated a flood of local and national headlines.",
    "Out of touch politicians deliver predictably bad results!?\nMoreno followed up by insisting Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as tweets  Users access Twitter *through* its website interface,? he explained.",
