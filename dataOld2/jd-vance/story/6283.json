    "But they share a the basic worldview: that individualist liberal ideology, increasingly bureaucratic governments, and big tech are all combining into a world that is at once tyrannical, chaotic, and devoid of the systems of value and morality that give human life richness and meaningas Blake Masters recently put it, a dystopian hell-world.?\nKirn didnt want to put a label on this movement, describing it as a fractious family of dissenters? when I called him at his home in Montanaa somewhat new, loose coalition of people whose major concern is that we not end up in a top-down controlled state.? He told me he didnt consider himself right wing and found some of the antidemocratic ideas he heard expressed in this sphere to be personally chilling.? But he described it as a zone of experimentation and free expression of a kind that was now closed off in Americas liberal mainstream.",
    "I get the feeling, and I could be wrong,? she said, that the right actually at this point is like almost in this live-and-let-live place where the left used to be at.? What she meant specifically: The idea that you cant raise your kids in a traditional, somewhat religious household without having them educated at school that their parents are Nazis.? This apparent laissez-faire obscures somewhat the intense focus that some people in this world have on trans issuesor what they might say is the medias intense focus on trans issues, one of a suite of mimetic viruses,? as Kaschuta, the podcaster, put it, that spread a highly individualistic liberal culture that is destructive to traditional ways of life.",
    "He has consistently argued that conservatives waste their time and political energy on fights over issues like gay marriage or critical race theory, because liberal ideology holds sway in the important institutions of prestige media and academiaan intertwined nexus he calls the Cathedral.? He developed a theory to explain the fact that America has lost its so-called state capacity, his explanation for why it so often seems that it is not actually capable of governing anymore: The power of the executive branch has slowly devolved to an oligarchy of the educated who care more about competing for status within the system than they do about Americas national interest.",
    "Mandela? was more innocent than Breivik might have a mother youd like to fuck.?\nHes tempered himself in middle agehe now says he has a rule never to say anything unnecessarily controversial, or go out of my way to be provocative for no reason.? Many liberals who hear him talk would probably question how strictly he follows this rule, but even in his Moldbug days, most of his controversial writings were couched in thickets of irony and metaphor, a mode of speech that younger podcasters and Twitter personalities on the highly online right have adopteda way to avoid getting kicked off tech platforms or having their words quoted by liberal journalists.",
    " Inside the Virus-Hunting Nonprofit at the Center of the Lab-Leak Controversy\n Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Probably Wont Be Splitting a Milkshake Anytime Soon\n CNN Leaves the Drama Behind With Focus on War in Ukraine\n Trumps Truth Social Is an Even Bigger Humiliation Than Previous Business Failures\n The Clock Is Ticking on the January 6 Investigation\n The Washington Post Checks In, Finds Trump Is Still a Lying Sociopath\n A Ukrainian Woman Explains the War to Europes Skeptics\n From the Archive: How Playboy Imran Khan Became the Prime Minister of Pakistan\n Not a subscriber?",
    "In 2014, The Baffler published a lengthy look at his influence, titled Mouthbreathing Machiavellis Dream of a Silicon Reich.? The piece warned that Yarvins ideas were spreading among prominent figures like Thiel and Balaji Srinivasan, formerly the CTO of Coinbase, and that it was possible for an intellectual fringe to seize key positions of authority and power? and eventually bring large numbers of people around,? just as the Koch brothers once had with their pro-business libertarianism, a position that Thiel was quickly moving away from.",
    "Other luminaries afoot for the conference included Dignity author Chris Arnade, who seemed slightly unsure about the whole NatCon thing, and Sohrab Ahmari, the former opinion editor of the New York Post, now a cofounder and editor at the new magazine Compact, whose vision is, according to its mission statement, shaped by our desire for a strong social-democratic state that defends communitylocal and national, familial and religiousagainst a libertine left and a libertarian right.? It is a very of-the-moment project.",
    "rep working with Kendall Roy; the show itself set right-wing Twitter?a sphere heavily populated by 20-somethings who work in tech or politics and seem to disproportionately live in D.C. and Miamialight with delight when an episode in the latest season included a litany of key New Right phrases such as integralist? and Medicare for all, abortions for none.?\nThe Red Scare hosts are only the best-known representatives of a fashionable dissident-y subculture, centered in but not exclusive to downtown Manhattan.",
    "In March, the journalist Jeff Sharlet (a Vanity Fair contributing editor who covers the American right) tweeted that the intellectual New Right is a white supremacist project designed to cultivate non-white support,? and he linked it to resurgent nationalist and authoritarian politics around the world: Its part of a global fascist movement not limited to the anti-blackness of the U.S. & Europe.? Yet many on the New Right seem increasingly unfazed by accusations that theyre white nationalists or racists.",
    "As early as 2012, he proposed the acronym RAGERetire All Government Employeesas a shorthand for a first step in the overthrow of the American regime.? What we needed, Yarvin thought, was a national CEO, [or] whats called a dictator.? Yarvin now shies away from the word dictator and seems to be trying to promote a friendlier face of authoritarianism as the solution to our political warfare: If youre going to have a monarchy, it has to be a monarchy of everyone,? he said.",
    "Until like a year and a half ago I didnt believe good and evil existed,? she told me, later adding: But Im not in a state of grace, I shouldnt be talking.? I asked if she would take money from Thiel and she cheerily said, Of course!? She also described her cohort as a bunch of libertines,? and on her podcast you can get a window into a world of people who enjoy a mind-bendingly ironic thrill by tut-tutting each other for missing church or having premarital sex.",
    "Some of Yarvins writing from then is so radically right wing that it almost has to be read to be believed, like the time he critiqued the attacks by the Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivikwho killed 77 people, including dozens of children at a youth campnot on the grounds that terrorism is wrong but because the killings wouldnt do anything effective to overthrow what Yarvin called Norways communist? government.",
    "Were just the last normal people, hanging out at the end of the world.?\nI had met Milius outside the Hilton when I asked for a cigarette, and she began to chaperone me around, telling people who eyed my press pass that I was there to profile her as an up-and-coming female director who, she said, had attracted more Amazon streams than any woman ever with her first documentary, a counternarrative about Russiagate.",
    "The ones deep into the online scene, she said, want to be like Leni RiefenstahlEdie Sedgwick.?\nLike Levy, Milius is in the funny position of being at the intersection of many of these crosscurrents, having worked in mainstream politics but appearing on so-called dissident podcasts and being on the periphery of a cultural scene where right-wing politics have taken on a sheen approximating cool.",
    "Laurenson told me shed had a gradual awakening that accelerated during the upheavals of the early pandemic and the protests of the summer of 2020. I started really getting drawn to NRx ideas,? she said, using a common online abbreviation for the neo-reactionary fringe, because I was tracking the riots,? by which she meant the violence that erupted amid some of the Black Lives Matter protests.",
    "I think that what Trump should do, if I was giving him one piece of advice: Fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.?\nAnd when the courts stop you,? he went on, stand before the country, and say? he quoted Andrew Jackson, giving a challenge to the entire constitutional orderthe chief justice has made his ruling.",
    "He and Thiel worked, generally without success, to install figures like Srinivasan, whom they proposed to head the FDA, and who himself often talked about the paper belt,? in an echo of Yarvins Cathedral concept, and made common cause with figures like Steve Bannon, who wanted to pick apart the administrative state, an idea that at least had a hint of Yarvins RAGE proposal.",
    "I think its really bleak, I think the default is continued stagnation, and maybe you get the crisis in 5 years or maybe its 30 years from now.?\nHe told me that he didnt like to use terms like the Cathedral and used the regime? less often than Vance, although I later noticed that he used this latter phrase frequently with interviewers on the dissident right.",
    "But within the Cathedral, the best way for me to get big assignments and win attention is to identify and attack what seem like threats against the established order, which includes nationalists, antigovernment types, or people who refuse to obey the opinions of the Cathedrals experts on issues like vaccine mandates, in as alarming a way as I possibly can.",
    "I spotted Yarvin, a slight, bespectacled man with long dark hair, drinking a glass of wine with a crowd that included Josh Hammer, the national conservatismminded young opinion editor of Newsweek, and Michael Anton, a Machiavelli scholar and former spokesman for Trumps National Security Counciland a prominent public intellectualizer of the Trump movement.",
    "Masters in particular seems willing to goad commentators, believing that the ensuing arguments will redound to his political advantage: Good luck [hitting] me with that,? Masters told the podcaster Alex Kaschuta recently, arguing that accusations of racism had become a political bludgeon used to keep conservative ideas outside the political mainstream.",
    "Most people seemed more caught up in fighting what they perceived as the cant and groupthink among other members of the political media class, or the hypocrisy of rich white liberals who put up Black Lives Matter signs in front of multimillion-dollar homes, than they were with the raw experience that has given shape to Americas current racial politics.",
    "At a coffee shop near the house hed bought when he moved back home to Tucson from the Bay Area, Masters and I went through the tenets of his nationalist platform: on-shoring industrial production, slashing legal immigration, regulating big tech companies, and eventually restructuring the economy so that one salary would be enough to raise a family on.",
    "They just need to eat.? He doesnt usually deal with mainstream magazines and wrote that hed been ambushed? at the last NatCon, in 2019, by a reporter for Harperswhere I also writewho made him out to be a bit of a loon and predicted that the NatCons populist program would soon be stripped of its parts? by the corporate-minded Republican establishment.",
    "I skipped most of the talkswhich ranged from sessions about confronting the threat of China to the liberal influence on pop culture to Worker Power.? Hawley gave a keynote on the assault on the masculine virtues,? and Cruz offered up a traditional stump speech, evoking Reagan and saying he thought conservatives would soon prevail at the ballot box.",
    "I just want to have a family someday.?\nLevy, who was a leftist recently enough that she cried when it became clear that Bernie Sanders wouldnt be the Democratic presidential nominee, is friendly with Yarvin and has had him on the podcast she cohosts, Wet BrainYeah, the Cathedral and blah blah,? she said when we got to talking about political media.",
    "If what he was doing worked, he said, it will mean that my son grows up in a world where his masculinityhis support of his family and his community, his love of his communityis more important than whether it works for fucking McKinsey.?\nAt that, we called it, and the crowd of young men who wanted to talk to him immediately descended on the couches.",
    "But most of the media attention that the conference attracts focuses on a cohort of rosy young blazer-wearing activists and writersa crop of people representing the American rights radical young intellectuals,? as a headline in The New Republic would soon put it, or conservatisms terrifying future,? as David Brooks called them in The Atlantic.",
    "This group encompasses everyone from rich crypto bros and tech executives to back-to-the-landers to disaffected members of the American intellectual class, like Up in the Air author Walter Kirn, whose fulminations against groupthink and techno-authoritarianism have made him an unlikely champion to the dissident right and heterodox fringe.",
    "This is a kind of burgeoning sect of thought,? he went on, and its causing people who are in positions of larger influence and relative power to actually have to start looking into it.?\nVance sits somewhere in between these two tendenciesat 37, hes a venture capitalist who is young enough to be exposed to the dissident online currents.",
    "I do care about the fact that in my community right now the leading cause of death among 18- to 45-year-olds is Mexican fentanyl.? His criticisms of big tech as enemies of Western civilization? often get lost in the run of Republican outrage over Trump being kicked off Twitter and Facebook, though they go much deeper than this.",
    "But maybe Im just saying that because I like you.?\nDespair,? he signed off, serves the regime.?\nPart of why people have trouble describing this New Right is because its a bunch of people who believe that the system that organizes our society and government, which most of us think of as normal, is actually bizarre and insane.",
    " This is what the people at The Washington Post think were doing. Well, this is exactly what the people at The Washington Post think were doing.?\nA portly guy running for Congress in Georgia made his way to the front of the room to give a speech heavy on MAGA buzzwords and florid expressions of fealty to Donald Trump.",
    "It can be confusing to turn on something like the influential underground podcast Good Ol Boyz and hear a figure like Anton talk to two autodidact Southern gamers about the makeup of the regime, if only because most people reading this probably dont think of America as the kind of place that has a regime at all.",
    "This kind of groupthink was not just a phenomenon of the liberal media, and this fact has hampered the campaigns of both Masters and Vance, who are often seen as Trump-aligned culture warriors, and who have had a lot of trouble working their more complicated policy ideas into our fervid political conversation.",
    "Its better described as a tangled set of frameworks for critiquing the systems of power and propaganda that most people reading this probably think of as the way the world is.? And one point shapes all of it: It is a project to overthrow the thrust of progress, at least such as liberals understand the word.",
    "At one end are the NatCons, post-liberals, and traditionalist figures like Benedict Option author Rod Dreher, who envision a conservatism reinvigorated by an embrace of localist values, religious identity, and an active role for the state in promoting everything from marriage to environmental conservation.",
    "The podcasters, bro-ish anonymous Twitter posters, online philosophers, artists, and amorphous scenesters in this world are variously known as dissidents,? neo-reactionaries,? post-leftists,? or the heterodox? fringethough theyre all often grouped for convenience under the heading of Americas New Right.",
    "But last September, a month before we spoke, he posted a dating call, inviting women who were reasonably pretty and pretty smart,? as he put it, and have read my work and like it,? and who thought that the purpose of dating is to get married and have kids,? to email him so they could set up a Zoom date.",
    "I think the cultural world you operate in is incredibly biased,? he saidagainst his movement and the leaders of it, like me in particular.? He encouraged me to resist this tendency, which he thought was the product of a media machine leading us toward a soulless dystopia that none of us want to live in.",
    "That impulse,? he said, is fundamentally in service of something that is far worse than anything, in your wildest nightmares, than what you see here.?\nHe gave me an imploring look, as though to suggest that he was more on the side of the kind of people who read Vanity Fair than most of you realize.",
    "Im going to talk about college.?\nWhat he meant was that he was about to give a genuinely thunderous speech, titled The Universities Are the Enemy.? People immediately pointed out that it was a variation on something that Richard Nixon said to Henry Kissinger on White House tapes back in 1972.",
    "I understand why youre saying that. ?\nLaurenson had been a well-known blogger and activist in the BDSM scene back when Yarvin was the central early figure in a world of neo-reactionary? writers, publishing his poetry and political theory on the Blogger site under the name Mencius Moldbug.",
    "Vance recently told an interviewer, I gotta be honest with you, I dont really care what happens to Ukraine,? a flick at the fact that he thinks the American-led global order is as much about enriching defense contractors and think-tank types as it is about defending Americas interests.",
    "Levy is an It girl in a downtown Manhattan sceneThe New Yorker has published her fiction; she is named in a New York Times story that tries to describe that scenewhere right-wing politics have become an aesthetic pose that mingles strangely with an earnest search for moral grounding.",
    "They have a wildly diverse set of political backgrounds, with influences ranging from 17th-century Jacobite royalists to Marxist cultural critics to so-called reactionary feminists to the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, whom they sometimes refer to with semi-ironic affection as Uncle Ted.",
    "I remember thinking at one point how strange it was that in our mid-30s Vance and I were significantly older than almost everyone there, all of whom thought they were organizing a struggle to change the course of human history, and all of whom were now going to get sloppy drunk.",
    "Youll hear these people talk about our globalized consumerist society as clown world.? Youll often hear the worldview expressed by our media and intellectual class described as the matrix? or the Ministry of Truth,? as Thiel described it in his opening keynote speech to NatCon.",
    "But the people these pieces describe, who made up most of the partygoers around me, were only the most buttoned-up seam of a much larger and stranger political ferment, burbling up mainly within Americas young and well-educated elite, part of an intra-media class info-war.",
    "And if we play it wrong, its the Dark Ages.? Masters has publicly said he thinks everybody should read? the Unabombers anti-tech manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future,? which may sound strange for a young tech executive running to serve in the United States Senate.",
    "She grew up in Los Angeles, and it turned out that wed both gone to the same tiny liberal arts college in Manhattan, so, like pretty much all the people there, she was used to living in social spaces where conservative views were considered strange if not downright evil.",
    "And I thought, Okay, thats a cool guy.? This friend has now made a bunch of money in crypto, works on a project Yarvin helped launch to build a decentralized internet, and lives hours out into the desert in Utah, where hell occasionally call in to New Rightish podcasts.",
    "Hes long been a big donor to Republican political candidates, but in recent years Thiel has grown increasingly involved in the politics of this younger and weirder worldbecoming something like a nefarious godfather or a genial rich uncle, depending on your perspective.",
    "But to ignore him is to underestimate how Yarvins ideas, or at least ideas in conversation with his, have become foundational to a whole political and cultural scene that goes much deeper than anything youd learn from the panels and speeches at an event like NatCon.",
    "We fund some weird stuff with the Thiel Foundation.?\nWe drove together to a campaign event, talking about everything from how technology is reshaping our brains to environmental policy, both of us circling from different political directions to an apocalyptic place.",
    "And its like, Well, the left is insane, and this kid shouldnt have been on trial, and theyre punishing him for being a white guy who defended himself with an AR-15. ? Conservative media seems to thrive on culture-war touch points as much as all the rest of it.",
    "This cycle becomes self-reinforcing and has been sent into hyperdrive by Twitter and Facebook, because the stuff that compels people to click on articles or share clips of a professor tends to affirm their worldview, or frighten them, or both at the same time.",
    "But she was horrified? by how the mainstream media covered the riots. It was just such a violation of all of my values.?\nShed had a strange realization after she and Yarvin started dating, discovering that some of her friends had been reading him for years.",
    "She thought something had radically changed since 2015, after she went to film school at USC and started working in Hollywood, before she suddenly dropped everything to work for Trumps campaign in Nevada, eventually landing a job in his State Department.",
    "Because it really is separate from the man himself, it has nothing to do with that.?\nShe argued that the New Right, or whatever you wanted to call it, was, paradoxically, much less authoritarian than the ideology that now presented itself as mainstream.",
    "I wanted to see how all this might translate into an actual election campaign, and Id been watching a lot of Fox News, including Yarvins streaming interview with Carlson in which he gave a swirling depiction of how the Cathedral produced its groupthink.",
    "Its a position that has become quietly edgy and cool in new tech outposts like Miami and Austin, and in downtown Manhattan, where New Rightish politics are in, and signifiers like a demure cross necklace have become markers of a transgressive chic.",
    "Vance showed up, wearing a suit and bright red tie, looking relaxed for a person who was about to give a speech to hundreds of people who viewed him as possibly a last great hope in saving the American nation from global corporatist subjugation.",
    "Among some of my circle, the phrase extra-constitutional has come up quite a bit.?\nId asked Vance to tell me, on the record, what hed like liberal Americans who thought that what he was proposing was a fascist takeover of America to understand.",
    "But Ive read that stuff, and I see what it means.?\nI asked him about the term Thielbucks, and how true it was that the Thiel Foundation was funding a network of New Right podcasters and cool-kid cultural figures as a sort of cultural vanguard.",
    "Good luck criticizing me for saying critical race theory is anti-white.? But for all the chatter of looming dystopia, no one I spoke to raised one of the most dystopian aspects of American life: our vast apparatus of prisons and policing.",
    "This has led an Ivy League intellectual and management classa quasi-aristocracy he calls the regime?to adopt a set of economic and cultural interests that directly oppose those of people in places like Middletown, Ohio, where he grew up.",
    "Dont fuck me here,? a dark-haired woman named Amanda Milius said to meas she somewhat imperiously dealt with a guy at the door who was skeptical about letting a reporter into the partyand say were all in here sacrificing kids to Moloch.",
    "I surreptitiously made a few searches of the name hed given me and was surprised when I couldnt find a single plausible hitthough that could have been because he was a hyper-secret crypto type; there were some of those floating around.",
    "It was Halloween in Orlando, and we had piled into a car to make a short trip from the Hilton to an after-party down the road, to wind up the first night of the latest edition of a gathering called the National Conservatism Conference.",
    "It has been very striking to me,? she said, how cool this world is becoming.?\nYarvin had given people a way to articulate a notion that somehow felt subversive to say out loud in Americathat history was headed in the wrong direction.",
    "Because Vance and this New Right cohort, who are mostly so, so highly educated and well-read that their big problem often seems to be that theyre just too nerdy to be an effective force in mass politics, are not anti-intellectual.",
    "NatCon, as this conference is known, has grown into a big-tent gathering for a whole range of people who want to push the American right in a more economically populist, culturally conservative, assertively nationalist direction.",
    "Vance is a former employee of Thiels Mithril Capital, and Masters, until recently the COO of Thiels so-called family office,? also ran the Thiel Foundation, which has become increasingly intertwined with this New Right ecosystem.",
    "These threeThiel, Vance, Mastersare all friends with Curtis Yarvin, a 48-year-old ex-programmer and blogger who has done more than anyone to articulate the world historical critique and popularize the key terms of the New Right.",
    "Yarvin is friendly and solicitous in person, despite the fact that he tends to think and talk so fast that he can start unspooling, reworking baroque metaphors to explain ideas to listeners who have heard them many times before.",
    "The Red Scare hosts both started out as diffident socialists, back when it was still possible to think that socialism represented an edgy political stance, in the little interlocking spheres of Americas media and political set.",
    "One of them, Nekrasova, actually became known in media circles for a clip that went megaviral in 2018, when she cut dead a reporter for Alex Joness Infowars trying to ambush Bernie Sanders supporters at a festival in Austin.",
    "In this world, almost every word is layered in so much irony that you can never be sure what to take seriously or not, perhaps a semiconscious defense mechanism for people convinced that almost everyone is out to get them.",
    "The crowd of a few dozen was mostly sweater-wearing retirees, immersed in a media culture in which the people who repeated the most incendiary and Trumpist talking points tended to gain attention and political support.",
    "Women wear clothes from Brandy Melville, which you can hear described ironically as fashionwear for girls with fascist leanings,? and which named one of its lines after John Galt, the hero of Ayn Rands Atlas Shrugged.",
    "Milius brought up Red Scare, a podcast that has become the premier example of this attractionshed actually cast one of the hosts, Dasha Nekrasova, in the film she made as her senior thesis in directing school at USC.",
    "Journalists and academics and thinkers of any kind now live in a desperate race for attentionand in Yarvins view, this is all really a never-ending bid for influence, serving the interests of our oligarchical regime.",
    "I agreed, with regret, because the conversation revealed someone who I think will be hugely influential in our politics in the coming years, even if he loses his Senate primary, as both of us thought was possible.",
    "She said she was too black-pilled?a very online term used to describe people who think that our world is so messed up that nothing can save it nowto think much about what it would look like for her side to win.",
    "There are signs that this may be happening, though not all the so-called cool kids involved in this vibe shift would want to be colored as the vanguard in a world historical rebellion against the global order.",
    "You could see Dave Rubin, and Jack Murphy, who hosts a popular New Rightish YouTube channel and is trying to build a fraternal group of men who believe in positive masculinity? that he calls the Liminal Order.",
    "Thiel has also funded things like the edgelordy and post-leftinflected New Peoples Cinema film festival, which ended its weeklong run of parties and screenings in Manhattan just a few days before NatCon began.",
    "If were going to push back against it, were going to have to get pretty wild, and pretty far out there, and go in directions that a lot of conservatives right now are uncomfortable with.?\nIndeed,? Murphy said.",
    "The last thing I want is some kind of definitive ideological war which leaves out the heterodox, complicated, and almost naively open spirit of American politics.?\nAnd the ferment is starting to get noticed.",
    "And the way conservatives can actually win in America, he has argued, is for a Caesar-like figure to take power back from this devolved oligarchy and replace it with a monarchical regime run like a start-up.",
    "Vance believes that the regime has sold an illusive story that consumer gadgets and social media are constantly making our lives better, even as wages stagnate and technology feeds an epidemic of depression.",
    "Someone like me who has made a career of writing about militias and extremist groups might go about my work thinking that all I do is try to tell important stories and honestly describe political upheaval.",

    "People use the derisive term bugman? to describe liberal men who lack tangible life skills like fixing trucks or growing foodguys who could end up spending their lives behind the bug-eyed screen of a V.R.",
    "For at least many of the young people, the actual business of conference going seemed to be beside the point, a gesture at how we used to conduct politics back before life in America spun out of control.",
    "The room was pitifully quiet, lit in strip-club red, and the sparse crowd was almost entirely male, with a cash bar off in the corner that seemed unable to produce drinks fast enough to buoy the mood.",
    "Last year the journalist Max Chafkin published a biography of Thiel, titled The Contrarian, in which he described Yarvin as the house political philosopher? for a network often called the Thielverse.",
    "And many of them hold views that would seem to make Thiel, a tech oligarch currently worth around $8 billion who recently resigned from the Metane Facebookboard of directors, their natural enemy.",
    "He argued that Nelson Mandela, once head of the military wing of the African National Congress, had endorsed terror tactics and political murder against opponents, and said anyone who claimed St.",

    "Political reporters, at least the ones who have bothered to write about Yarvin, have often dismissed him as a kook with a readership made up mostly of lonely internet weirdos, fascists, or both.",
    "You wont hear people use the Cathedral term a lot in public, although right-wing Twitter lit up with delight when Yarvin sketched the concept on Tucker Carlsons Fox Nation show last September.",
    "People whove opened their eyes to this system of control have taken the red pill, a term Yarvin started using back in 2007, long before it got watered down to generally mean supporting Trump.",
    "This worldview, these worldviews, run counter to the American narrative of the last centurythat economic growth and technological innovation are inevitably leading us toward a better future.",

    "As Moldbug, Yarvin wrote about race-based IQ differences, and in an early post, titled Why I Am Not a White Nationalist,? he defended reading and linking to white nationalist writing.",
