    "In a more normal year, without high inflation, including skyrocketing fuel prices and a Democratic Party struggling to define itself, Ryan might stand a chance.",
    "The candidate who should perhaps have felt most betrayed by Trump was Timken, who won Portmans endorsement and for a time was the favorite to win Trumps, too.",
    "And Matt Dolan, another affluent businessman and state senator who, while declining to seek Trumps endorsement, made it clear that he supported Trumpism.",
