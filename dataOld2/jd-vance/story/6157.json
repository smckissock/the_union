And he praised Vance when the Ohio candidate appeared on his program last week, telling the candidate that if he was elected, Washington Republicans were going to become completely unhinged and hysterical, which is always a measure of your effectiveness.?\nHawley, who rose to prominence in 2020 for opposing certification of the presidential election results, has repeatedly denied interest in running for president in 2024.",
    "The Missouri Republican lavished praise on Masters in a statement to be released Monday, saying he understands the threats our country faces  from the Chinese Communist Party to the corrupt Big Tech monopolies to the political elite determined to take apart our way of life,? and adding: We need new leaders who will fight for this country.?\nMasters is running in a competitive primary that also features state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, wealthy solar energy executive Jim Lamon, and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Mick McGuire.",
    "Thiel has contributed $10 million to a super PAC backing Masters, his former de facto chief of staff, as well as $13.5 million to another group bolstering Vance, a venture capitalist and the author of the book Hillbilly Elegy.?

    "The two have remained in touch since: They have made regular appearances at the National Conservative Conference, an annual populist-oriented gathering of high-profile conservatives.",
    "Regardless of whether Hawley is preparing to run for president, many Republicans are convinced the Missouri Republican is positioning himself to play a bigger role in GOP politics.",
