    "The Kentuckian had already spoken with President Joe Biden by phone ahead of the trip, telling him that he wanted to blunt former President Donald Trump's influence by conveying to allies in Eastern Europe that Republicans still believe NATO is important.\nMy argument to [Biden] was, I want to reinforce with the Europeans after some loose talk during the Trump years about whether NATO is important, that at least at the moment, the most important Republican we currently have in Congress has a different point of view, McConnell said in an interview in his office Thursday just off the Senate floor, a few hours after the chamber had sent the aid package to Biden's desk.",
    "And I would plead with you to focus on the people who are voting here [in the Senate] and what is actually happening, not sometimes-loose campaign talk out in primaries across America.\nStill, as that group grows louder at the encouragement of the former president, other Republicans insist they've been pushing Biden to do more to help Ukraine from the start  including in the run-up to the invasion, when lawmakers from both parties feared that the administration wasn't doing enough to arm the Ukrainians before the onslaught began.",

    "In the end, 11 of the 50 Republican senators voted against the sprawling military and humanitarian assistance bill, with some complaining about the price tag and others wary of funneling taxpayer money overseas when there are problems at home.",
    "But hopefully we'll have some more folks join me after November.\nMcConnell, meanwhile, dismissed the idea that Hawley's view is on the rise within the party, arguing that campaign rhetoric doesn't always portend actual votes on legislation.",
    "That's not changed.\nWhat McConnell described as a landslide 86-11 vote on the Ukraine aid bill somewhat masks the partisan tensions on the issue that persist behind the scenes  and once again spilled out into the open this week.",
