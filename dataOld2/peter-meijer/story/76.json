    "The New Yorker supported last year's infrastructure compromise; he helped negotiate a bipartisan deal to create an independent 9/11 commission; he backed a criminal contempt referral against Steve Bannon for failing to comply with a congressional subpoena; and he voted to impeach Donald Trump a year ago this week.",
    "In theory, Republican Rep. John Katko has a compelling reason to run for re-election: The New York congressman is the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, and if the GOP takes back the House majority, he'd be in line to lead the influential panel.",
    "As for the rest of the contingent  Washington's Jaime Herrera Beutler, Wyoming's Liz Cheney, Michigan's Peter Meijer, Washington's Dan Newhouse, South Carolina's Tom Rice, and California's David Valadao  each appear to be running for re-election this year.",
    "Katko is the third member of the group to head for the exits, and the list may yet grow: Michigan's Fred Upton said late last week that he's undecided about running again in the fall.",
    "A month later, when Illinois' Adam Kinzinger said he, too, would not seek re-election, the former president celebrated again, saying, \"2 down, 8 to go!\"",
    "In September, for example, Ohio's Anthony Gonzales announced his retirement, adding at the time that the former president is \"a cancer for the country.\"",
    "He set out to end their careers  not because they'd done anything wrong, but because they'd voted to hold Trump accountable for his wrongdoing.",
    "That said, each are also facing credible primary challengers who are eager to participate in Trump's crusade against the apostates.",
    "It reached the point two months ago that some House Republicans pushed party leaders to punish Katko for his partisan heresies.",
    "When Trump was impeached for a second time, 10 House Republicans voted in the majority.",
    "It was against this backdrop that the House Republican decided to call it quits.",
    "NBC News reported:\nThe former president's specific phrasing was of interest.",
    "The campaign against the Impeachment 10 has had some effect.",
    "Trump boasted in a written statement, \"1 down, 9 to go!\"",
    "But in practice, there's a ceiling on Katko's prospects."
