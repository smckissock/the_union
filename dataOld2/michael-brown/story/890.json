    "Says Wurmbrand:\nI have seen Christians in communist prisons with fifty pounds of chains on their feet, tortured with red-hot iron pokers, in whose throats spoonfuls of salt had been forced, being kept afterward without water, starving, whipped, suffering from cold  and praying with fervor for the communists.",
    "After you read his absolutely horrendous plans, pay special attention to the last sentence, in which Hitler reveals why he's so sure he can get away with committing genocide while pulling off what he calls the \"redistribution of the world\":\nMy decision to attack Poland was arrived at last spring.",
