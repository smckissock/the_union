    "So, Im going to continue to advocate for kids, but Im going to continue to go out and win the Senate seat, and maybe I can go out and do even more, and they may not be happy with that as well.",
    "This administration is not doing whats great for the state of Georgia, whats great for this country.",
    "I think theyre trying to help out my opponent, which is OK because Im going to beat him anyway.",
    "Its sort of like, whats good for me is not good for thee, and I think all that theyre doing.",
    "Walker said he did not believe the move would prevent him from winning.",
    "But it is OK  the bad policies that theyre doing right now.",
    "The people are sort of waking up now and know it.",
    "Right now, Im in a tough race, he said.",
    "And first of all, Im not paid on this.",

    "I really havent, he replied.",
    "I was not paid at all.",
    "Thats whats so funny.",
    "So, Im OK with it."
