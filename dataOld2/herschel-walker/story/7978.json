    "| Jeff Roberson/AP Photo, file\nBy Natalie Allison and Burgess Everett\n 03/21/2022 07:32 PM EDT\nUpdated: 03/21/2022 07:54 PM EDT\nNew allegations against Eric Greitens are uniting Republicans of all stripes around the fear that he will cost the party dearly this fall if hes the GOP nominee in Missouri, a must-win race in the partys fight for control of the Senate.",
    "Several Republican senators said on Monday that Greitens should exit the race, and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said the new accusations are pretty disturbing, calling on Trump to take a big pause before endorsing in the race  an eyebrow raising departure from Scotts normal neutrality.",
    "I will continue to love and care for my beautiful sons with all of my being, and that includes fighting for the truth and against completely fabricated, baseless allegations, Greitens said, accusing political operatives and the liberal media of lying about the accusations.",
    "In an affidavit related to the couples child custody arrangement, Sheena Greitens, who currently resides with the children in Austin, wrote that her ex-husband made her fear for her and her two young sons safety, the Associated Press first reported.",
    "The document, filed as part of Sheena Greitens request to move the custody case to a court in Texas, included allegations that Greitens struck her and their children, including leaving one son with a swollen face, bleeding gums, and loose tooth.",
    "Its a development that could shake up the crowded GOP Senate primary, where Greitens has remained in the lead despite top establishment Republicans working against him  and where former President Donald Trump has so far refrained from endorsing.",
    "Spokespeople for the state attorney generals office and the Boone County Prosecuting Attorneys office, where the affidavit was filed, did not immediately respond to requests for comment about any potential investigations into the allegations.",
    "While the new abuse allegations provide ammunition for opposing campaigns  and potentially new anti-Greitens outside spending groups  to attack the former governor with television ads, Greitens is not expected to exit the race anytime soon.",
    "The allegations that Greitens abused his family, which he denies, also draw similarities to Sean Parnell, the Trump-endorsed Senate candidate who dropped out of the Pennsylvania GOP primary after losing custody of his children this fall.",
    "He later appeared on Steve Bannons War Room show alleging that his ex-wife had conspired with RINO Republicans to smear him, claiming that a news story would come out as early as Tuesday to connect the dots directly to Mitch McConnell.",
    "I dont think  and never have thought  that this guy is playing with a full deck of cards, said Gregg Keller, a Missouri-based Republican strategist who is working on a super PAC supporting Attorney General Eric Schmitt in the race.",
    "Rep. Billy Long, another candidate in the race who earlier in the day said it wasnt his place to tell Greitens what to do, later changed his mind after reading the affidavit, saying there is no way he can stay in this race.",
    "In a statement on Monday, Greitens said he would seek full custody of his children, though his ex-wifes affidavit explained the boys school and social life is currently based in Austin, Texas, where she is employed.",
    "Hartzler said its time for Eric to get out of the Senate race and to get professional help, while Schmitt called the allegations against Greitens disgusting and sickening, saying I know a predator when I see one.",
    "His remarks suggested more concern about Greitens than he had during Parnells child custody fight in November, when Scott insisted on remaining neutral as Parnells wife raised similar allegations under oath.",
    "As attorney general, Hawley investigated the then-governor in 2018 over Greitens use of a charity donor list to solicit campaign funds, turning the findings over to a St. Louis prosecutor.",
    "Hawley previously endorsed Parnell and, like most Senate Republicans, is backing Herschel Walker in Georgias Senate race, where Walker is also facing allegations of past domestic abuse.",
    "Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouris junior senator who last month endorsed Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the race to succeed Blunt, said it was time for Eric Greitens to leave this race.",
    "The behavior described in this affidavit is cause for Eric Greitens to be in prison, not on the ballot for U.S. Senate, Schmitt said in a statement provided to POLITICO.",
    "Senate Minority Whip John Thune said that a Greitens nomination could amount to the most difficult path for Republicans to win what should be a safe Republican seat.",
    "On Monday, Hawley acknowledged he has a little history with Greitens and his controversies, adding he feels like he is somewhat familiar with the former governor.",
    "The couple divorced after Greitens resigned as Missouri governor mid-term in 2018 amid allegations that he sexually assaulted and blackmailed his hairstylist.",
    "Greitens became the first Senate candidate last year to publicly take on the Senate minority leader, vowing to work to oust him from leadership if elected.",
    "Even Democrat Lucas Kunce  whose likely only chance at victory in the general election would be on a ballot against Greitens  said Greitens should bow out.",
    "For months, political operatives in Missouri and Washington, D.C., warned that there would likely be more damning accusations to come out against Greitens.",
    "The other shoe dropped Monday, after the disgraced former Missouri governors ex-wife alleged in court documents that he abused her and their children.",
    "Greitens was subsequently charged with computer tampering, though the charge was dropped as part of a deal with prosecutors to resign from office.",
    "Alarm in Washington is palpable as Republicans fret Greitens will blow the race to succeed retiring Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).",
    "Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Greitens doesnt seem like the kind of person who ought to be running for the U.S. Senate.",
    "Weve got to understand what the facts are, Scott said Monday, stopping short of calling on Greitens to drop out.",
    "Up until now, Eric Greitens has remained in the lead despite top establishment Republicans working against him.",
    "There are good candidates running, so hopefully primary voters will nominate someone who can win, Cornyn said.",
    "I had qualms about him running with that first incident, Ernst said, referring to an earlier alleged scandal.",
    "And back in Washington, D.C., multiple top Republicans voiced concerns about Greitens remaining in the race.",
    "All major Republican candidates in the Missouri Senate race on Monday called on Greitens to drop out.",
    "Sheena Greitens on Monday did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    "I think hes a psychopath and/or a sociopath, and Im not joking when I say that.",
    "I mean, the old allegations were quite substantial on their own, Thune said.",
    "A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    "So unfortunately it looks like a pattern to me, Hawley said.",
    "You talk about a child with a tooth loose thats bleeding?",
    "Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who has also endorsed Hartzler.",
    "It is a message thats resonating across the Senate GOP.",
    "I think the voters will make a good decision.",
    "It doesnt sound good, lets put it that way.",
    "He should end his campaign immediately.",
    "So this is not getting better for him.",
    "McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to comment.",
    "She seems pretty credible to me.",
    "I wish he would drop out, said.",
    "I dont think he gets out.",
    "Thats beyond the pale.",
    "Come on."
