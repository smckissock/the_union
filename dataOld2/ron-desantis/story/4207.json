    "Now, Eisen and contributing authors have turned the report into a more comprehensive analysis: Overcoming Trumpery: How to Restore Ethics, the Rule of Law, and Democracy.?\nI recently interviewed Eisen about the new book, which provides an exhaustive to-do list of institutional guardrails, including ethics reform, bolstered congressional oversight and depoliticization of the Justice Department.",
    "In an invaluable Brookings Institution paper last year, Norm Eisen, counsel to various people and groups litigating on behalf of democracy (and to the Trump impeachment managers), helped compile a list of the fixes? needed to repair the Trump eras systemic damage.",
    "The logical culmination of four years of Trumpery was his attempted coup to stay in power, and instead of backing away from that big lie?-driven criminal conspiracy, many in the GOP have embraced Trumpery, and many more tolerate it.",
    "Thats different from anything weve seen in U.S. history  even with the most corrupt presidents  because Trumpery rejects the core principles that make us a democratic republic and instead moves us towards autocracy.",
    "For example, the Senate is considering Electoral Count Act-plus? reform: changing federal law to definitively reject the bizarre legal theories that Trump advanced to try to effectuate his coup in Congress.",
    "The spread of disinformation and how to fight that with truth is something we work on a lot at the States United Democracy Center, which I co-chair with former GOP governor Christine Todd Whitman.",
    "We also know that autocracy cannot succeed without complicity, and thats what voters are choosing every time they vote for any GOP official who does not affirmatively reject Trumpery.",
    "When you see things like his creation of a new election police force, and you think about the attempted coup that we avoided after the 2020 election, you cant help but be chilled.",
    "The plus? consists of other possible federal responses to the big lie?-driven assaults on elections and election officials that are still going on from coast to coast.",
    "As I note in Overcoming Trumpery,? Im fundamentally optimistic that we will succeed if we do the hard work of preserving democracy together, just as we did in 2020.",
    "Eisen: I do think social media is a big part of the problem  and we are in the process of figuring out how to make it a part of the solution as well.",
    "And almost every other democracy, rule-of-law and ethics reform in Overcoming Trumpery? can also be adapted and adopted at the state and local level.",
    "Yes, we could have been inoculated against Trumpery by the comprehensive democratic reforms that passed the House and should have passed the Senate.",
    "But as we explain in the volume, important steps to counter Trumpery are still possible at the federal level and at the state and local levels.",
    "Eisen: When voters had a chance to react to Trumps style of governance, they definitively rejected it in 2018 and again in 2020.",
    "Eisen: Overcoming Trumpery? not only documents the evolution of Trumpery (even I was shocked when I saw it all in one place!).",
    "Norm Eisen: The book is the first to analyze Trumps lying and corrupt style in office as a philosophy of governing: Trumpery.",
    "Rubin: Democrats cannot get any of your reforms passed without filibuster reform, which they dont have the votes to pass.",
    "But the good news is Trumpery was defeated once and there are many solutions to defeat it again, which we also lay out.",
    "And I was, of course, disappointed that we fell two votes shy of the filibuster reform that the book calls for.",
    "But Republicans learned from that, and, like a virus, Trumpery is evolving to present a more appealing face.",
    "Rubin: Whats your take on the role of social media in the erosion of democracy, and what do we do about it?",
    "This transcript has been edited lightly for style, length and clarity.",
    "Thats what makes DeSantis so dangerous  hes practicing Trumpery 2.0.",
    "We outline what that federal package might look like in the book.",
    "or Congressman Jim Jordan [R-Ohio] are taking it to new depths.",
    "It also offers solutions, many of which are still available.",
    "It has seven features, the seven deadly sins of Trumpery.",
    "They know what Republicans are and keep voting for them.",
    "Rubin: How much of this is the fault of voters?",
    "Ron DeSantis [Fla.], Sen. Josh Hawley [R-Mo.]",
    "Indeed, adherents like Gov.",
    "So, there is hope!",
    "So, theres a lot!",
    "What do they do?"
