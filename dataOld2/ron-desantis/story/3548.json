    "Last Tuesday, Hawley proposed the Copyright Clause Restoration Act,? which his press release characterized as strip[ping] woke corporations like Disney of special copyright protection.?\nThe bill would roll back the duration of copyright protection to 56 years  the protective period that Congress enacted in 1909.",
    "Hawleys limit of 56 years would put the United States in violation of the Berne Convention, the major international copyright treaty that supports enforcement of U.S. copyright interests abroad and which requires signatories to enact copyright duration of not less than the authors life plus 50 years.",
    "Reasonable people can debate whether Congresss decision to expand copyright duration was a good idea (and especially to add another 20 years in 1998)  we have our doubts  but there is no question that it played a critical role in gaining U.S. entry into the Berne Convention.",

    "Recall that the entertainment giant, which operates Disney World in Orlando, criticized DeSantiss Dont Say Gay? act that restricts discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.",
    "He probably didnt anticipate that it also would prompt bond agencies to consider lowering Floridas bond rating, a move that makes future borrowing more expensive for cities and towns.",
    "As global trade in creative arts and technology expanded in the mid-to-late 20th century, the United States took on a leadership role in the global intellectual property arena.",
    "To steal some of DeSantiss thunder, Hawley appears ready not only to undo property and free speech rights, but also to bust a foundation of Americas international trade.",
    "Hawleys Copyright Clause Restoration Act? is the kind of publicity stunt that undermines both core Constitutional values and economic stability.",
    "Importantly, Hawleys bill would compress those protections retroactively for the largest entertainment companies, such as the Disney company.",
    "Property rights  and especially intellectual property rights  lie at the core of the U.S. economy and future economic prosperity.",
    "The Hill has removed its comment section, as there are many other forums for readers to participate in the conversation.",
    "The government doing so in retaliation against one company also violates the First Amendments guarantee of free speech.",

    "Hawley is undoubtedly aware of the ramifications of his bill on property rights and international trade.",
    "Property rights promote progress by rewarding creators and inventors and attracting capital investment.",
    "His proposed legislation is a new low in his race to the bottom of Republican political demagoguery.",
    "Trade sanctions and financial penalties are easy to imagine were this bill to be adopted.",
    "In the case of individuals, copyright protection lasts 70 years after the authors death.",
    "Hawleys one-upmanship risks greater harm to American business and global standing.",
    "And that is the whole point, as his press release singling out Disney made clear.",
    "Hawleys bill is aimed directly at Disneys copyright of its original Mickey Mouse.",
    "Currently, in the case of corporations owning copyrights, they last 95 years.",
