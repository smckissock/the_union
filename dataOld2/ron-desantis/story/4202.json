    "The Save the Manatee Club praised the funding as a needed step in the right direction for a wildlife disaster that state and federal agencies refer to as an unusual mortality event.?\nDue to the unprecedented severity of the ongoing Unusual Mortality Event  in which more than 1,600 manatees have died statewide over the last 16 months  these and additional extraordinary measures are called for in order to protect manatees and their critical habitat,? said Patrick Rose, the groups executive director, in a statement.",
    "The funding will direct nearly $25 million to expand and upgrade the network of acute-care centers, such as one run by SeaWorld Orlando, restore manatee access to springs, restore seagrass and other habitat conditions where they concentrate and expand rescue and rehabilitation capacity.",
    "We must insist that the state of Florida and the Environmental Protection Agency join forces to ensure that improved water quality standards are set and met if we are going to restore these aquatic ecosystems for the long-term future,? Rose said.",
    "Last year, the state counted the highest annual number of deaths on record at 1,101.\nThis historic funding will support important restoration efforts across the state to benefit our manatees and Floridas natural environment,? DeSantis said.",
    "Ron DeSantis announced Monday in Jacksonville he will sign off on more than $30 million in manatee care, rehabilitation and other support allocated recently by the legislature.",
    "Fish and Wildlife Service set up their emergency feeding program at a Florida Power & Light Co. power plant south of Titusville where manatees gather during winter cold snaps.",
    "Another $5.3 million will bolster manatee response abilities, including hiring 12 more employees for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.",
    "The $25 million also will underwrite experimental responses such as the program to feed lettuce to manatees in Brevard County that ended recently.",
    "Florida manatee deaths are at more than 500 in just the first four months of 2022, a toll nearly equal to the fifth-deadliest year on record.",
    "The Indian River in Brevard County has been particularly hard hit by seagrass losses and manatee deaths.",
    "Their primary food source along the Atlantic coast, seagrass, has been decimated by water pollution.",
    "Timing for the recovery of that ecosystem and declines in manatee deaths are uncertain at best.",
    "Manatees are in their second year of an emergency brought on by starvation.",
    "About $160,000 will support increased aerial surveys of manatees.",
    "With that high rate of mortalities as a backdrop, Gov.",
    "The state wildlife commission and U.S.",
