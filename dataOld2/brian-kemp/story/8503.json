    "New York Times columnist David Brooks and Washington Post associate editor Jonathan Capehart join Judy Woodruff to discuss the week in politics, including the potential for meaningful changes to federal gun regulations after the unspeakable tragedy at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and former President Trump's influence on primary races in Georgia and elsewhere.",
    "How many more babies are going to have to be killed, slaughtered in classrooms before Congress does something, before moderate Republicans come out and say, this is not what we're for, before NRA members, who we keep hearing, vast majority of them are very nuanced  they understand what's going on, and yet their leadership is doing something completely different.",
    "And that can't not have an effect on us all, just the emotional blows, the moral blows, and then the haunting fear that these events are not isolated incidents, but part of a rising tide of menace across society, not only the mass shootings, racist, crazy, against children, but just a growing level of sense of people are under threat.",
    "And he said to me, he's  he always has to be hopeful, but he's skeptical, and that maybe the only thing they can do is just bring bills to the floor and have people vote and have them be on record, and I'm adding this, standing against the safety of children, grocery store shoppers, parishioners, movie theater goers.",
    "I also do think it's a sign in Georgia, when you get the governor, lieutenant governor, and the secretary of state, all Republicans, all standing up to Trump together, with a lot of the other Republicans in the state of Georgia, it shows that if you combine together to stand up to Trump, you can beat him.",
    "If they are tired of seeing what's happening, then they can do something by voting with their feet and voting, going to the ballot box, and putting people in office who will do something to protect us, because I agree with you.",
    "Today, just moments ago, former President Trump, speaking at the NRA convention in Texas, is talking about, we need to focus on mental health, that nothing  no new gun law could have prevented what happened in Uvalde.",
    "It's heartening that Senator Joe Manchin, who was a part of that way back  way back when 10 years ago, the Manchin-Toomey bill  background checks didn't go anywhere  but now says: I think about my grandchildren.",
    "And when it comes to Mastriano, the gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania, if he wins, the big lie is going to be front and center come 2024, because he, as governor, appoints the secretary of state.",
    "And so, great, Brad Raffensperger beat out the Trump-endorsed candidate, but I don't think there's a whole lot of daylight between Trump and Raffensperger on anything else that goes beyond the big lie.",
    "And, as I have said before, I'm hard-pressed to tell you what any of these Republicans running for office, what they're for, beyond their position on the big lie, whether they're for it or against it.",
    "David Brooks:\nYes, I mean, their argument is that, A, it's a right guaranteed in the Constitution, B, they have an ethos of we take care of ourselves, and that we're going to provide our own safety.",
    "And if you look at the history, even from all the way through all these shootings, you see a spike in support for gun regulations, which then drops over time, but doesn't drop all the way back.",
    "Somebody made the point  I think, was my colleague Nick Kristof  that if you  if I lose my phone, and you pick it up, it's basically useless to you, because you don't have my code.",
    "I'm tired of politicians who don't move to do anything to even pass something that won't stop every mass shooting, but at least might prevent one or two or  we don't know.",
    "I guess, aside from the sadness of it, the frustration that Jonathan just expressed, I wonder what it's like for all of us to experience the news these days.",
    "And this is what normally happens in American history, that you get a third-party candidate or some new force, and then one of the parties co-opts it.",
    "I'm tired of politicians who go on and on and on about being pro-life and  for the unborn, but have seemingly no care for them once they are born.",
    "To discuss what this means for the November midterm elections and for the country as a whole, we turn to the analysis of Brooks and Capehart.",
    "David Brooks:\nWell, some of the news stories are unreadable for me, the  especially the interviews with the surviving kids from that school.",
    "If you see somebody in your orbit who is suicidal or something, you can go to a law enforcement and make it impossible for them to get guns.",
    "And as the mass shooting unfolded on Tuesday, voters were casting their ballots in primary elections in Georgia and several other states.",
    "In many ways, he was on  not on the ballot, but his choices were on the ballot, Jonathan, in some more of these primary races this week.",
    "David Brooks:\nI mean, Trump was Trump, because, in 2016, the Republican elite was over here, and the Republican voters were over here.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nAny meaningful changes to federal gun regulations appear unlikely, even after the unspeakable tragedy in Uvalde, Texas.",
    "I mean, his  David  yes, David Perdue got stomped by more than 50 points by Brian Kemp, someone who Trump was desperate to knock out.",
    "And so I worry about the whole moral atmosphere of this country, of which these mass shootings are only the most cancerous effects.",
    "Jonathan, the news we're hearing today about the slow police response is adding to the heartache of this awful event in Texas.",
    "Several gun safety measures are overwhelmingly popular with the American people, and yet Congress can't do anything about it.",
    "I would love it for somebody at the NRA convention happening right now as we're speaking\nJudy Woodruff:\nWe have to have hope.",
    "Judy Woodruff:\nAnd you do have  but you do have, David  I mean, large swathes of this country believe that guns are right.",
    "It's almost 10 years since we saw 20 children slaughtered at Newtown, something we had never seen before in this country.",
    "And then I think there is the possibility of changing the way we talk about this in order to get people who are winnable.",
    "David Brooks:\nAnd  but it  we have to somehow stop this from being a culture war issue, because then it's just hopeless.",
    "To me, it's how far, is the person who wasn't endorsed by Trump, policy-wise, how far is that person away from Trump?",
    "And a lot of people who support gun rights say it's just a bunch of coastal elites telling us how to live our lives.",
    "And we have a major  then we would have a major electoral state that could mess up a peaceful transfer of power.",
    "That is New York Times columnist David Brooks, and Jonathan Capehart, associate editor for The Washington Post.",
    "And I think it also shows that January 6  this was really about January 6, more than all the other primaries.",
    "To me, the larger  the bigger issue is not which Trump-endorsed candidate wins in which one loses how many.",
    "And so there's a whole series of things that can be done that are just normal, because we do them for cars.",
    "And, finally, it's become a culture war issue, where the gun has now become a mythic emblem of rural life.",
    "What is it going to take to get folks in Washington, to get folks in statehouses to protect our children?",
    "And, at a certain point, it's just going to be I'm going to feel under siege just as an American period.",
    "Not even a background checks bill could get through, overwhelmingly popular with the American people.",
    "And here we are 10 years later looking at yet another mass shooting in a school, 19 children killed.",
    "I interviewed Senator Chris Murphy on my MSNBC show this Sunday after Buffalo just two Sundays ago.",
    "Peggy Noonan, columnist for The Wall Street Journal said, people are proud of their bitterness now.",
    "I wish I was in a position to cast a vote that would make it possible to do something about this.",
    "Why not do the same thing for anybody wanting to buy an assault rifle, an AR-15, a weapon of war?",
    "I'm tired of watching grieving families pour their hearts out about losing their young children.",
    "Vance, who Trump swooped in at the last minute and put him over, or Mastriano in Pennsylvania.",
    "They're willing to put those restrictions on young women who are seeking reproductive care.",
    "And there are all sorts of things you could do that are kind of like what we do with cars.",
    "And so I think that makes Trump actually weaker, because now there Trumpists everywhere.",
    "School board meetings, churches, co-op board meetings, just a rising tide of menace.",
    "What about a 48-hour waiting period or, for someone 18 years old, parental consent?",
    "Now, there's still some out there running who very much have the Trump imprimatur.",
    "But what does this  does this say that maybe there's a weakening of his influence?",
    "And Trump somehow noticed this and said, I will be over here, thank you very much.",
    "Welcome to the program after another very tough week in this country that we love.",

    "One, every time one of these events does happen, it does change minds.",
    "It's just not something Republicans want to go to the mat for anymore.",
    "We look to Washington, we look to our leaders, and what do we see?",
    "Looking at  you talked about, what are we going to do about it?",
    "The gun rights are a way to prevent threat from the government.",
    "And so he doesn't have the one unique lane that he had in 2016.",
    "And, to me, you  Trumpism with Trump or without Trump is here.",
    "And it could be a sign that that  the big lie is not a winner.",
    "C, they have an ethos that the government's out to threaten.",

    "Think about your grandchildren.",
    "I think there may be some hope.",
    "It depends on the jurisdiction.",
