    "Things are bleak, but we put our hope in Georgia's gubernatorial candidate Kandiss \"Jesus Guns Babies\" Taylor, who like a fierce cross (thank you Jesus) between Ayn Rand, Elmer Gantry and Bill Hader's Stefon, has vowed to push out elitists and solar farms, stand up to the Luciferian Cabal, bring the Satanic Regime to its knees and end \"the perversions of the furry culture,\" especially after one killed all those people in Buffalo.",
    "She says \"we have a fraudulent pedophile in the White House\" so we need \"a full forensic audit\" of the 2020 election; we must \"take dominion over what God's given us\" to \"evict the Devil and global elitists,\" including Soros; she's \"not a big womens empowerment person,\" but \"I belong to Jesus - I'm bought and paid for with His blood.\"",
    "A Georgia native and \"educator,\" she writes that when she earned a PhD in counseling she was inspired (sic) by commencement speaker Ben Carson's notion of \"citizen servants,\" and \"felt led by the Lord to run for office because I wont bend my knee to tyranny.\"",
    "Taylor echoed him on Facebook, noting that, even before the massacre, she'd written an \"executive order\" for a dress code that would ban \"furry\" attire, but \"received blowback for tackling the perversions of the furry culture.\"",
    "In 2018, their candidate campaigned in a \"deportation bus\" - \"Fill this bus with illegals\" - before going to jail for insurance fraud; this year's candidates are all fighting to out-trash the \"woke mob.\"",
    "As noted on the radio program of wingnut Stew Peters, \"The Feds knew about the (Buffalo) shooter, who was a mentally-disturbed 'furry,' and they let it happen... A sick and demented furry did it.\"",
    "A longtime, award-winning journalist, she moved to the Maine woods in the early 70s, where she spent a dozen years building a house, hauling water and writing before moving to Portland.",
    "Declaring herself \"the ONLY candidate bold enough to stand up to the Luciferian Cabal,\" she vowed, \"I will bring the Satanic Regime to its knees - and DEMOLISH the Georgia Guidestones.\"",
    "Even cooler than how \"we will not be kneeling ourselves to a globalist Luciferian regime that has overtaken our nation,\" Taylor vows, \"The furry days are over when I'm governor.\"",
    "He noted that the shooter had posted a cartoon dog on his livestream and gratefully added, \"When Kandiss Taylor is elected governor, GA will be furry-free.\"",
    "In a feverish video, Taylor goes there: Vaccines, the unborn, lockdowns, humiliation rituals, the Global Luciferian Regime: \"They told us it was coming.",
    "Brian Kemp; behind him is Trump-endorsed David Perdue; Taylor's in third place, and endorsed by Roger Stone and the Pillow Guy, so what could go wrong?",
    "Having come of political age during the Vietnam War, she has long been involved in women's, labor, anti-war, social justice and refugee rights issues.",
    "On police: \"I want to see communities take themselves back...In inner cities, stop the crime and breaking in windows and killing the elderly.\"",
    "Said Guidestones are a large, weird, Stonehenge-like monolith erected in 1980 by some eccentric who evidently thought the world was ending.",
    "Also, one suggests the \"global pandemic treaty will be amended this month, and it will be used by the WHO to prevent the elections.\"",
    "On our biggest problems: Gas prices, the 2020 election, masks and mandates, solar farms: \"Who's making the money?",
    "QAnon cranks decided it's a Satanic monument to human sacrifice revealing the evil plans of the New World Order.",
    "So did the breathless announcement earlier this month of an \"Executive Order 10\" that would \"rock the nation.\"",
    "Polls show her with up to 5% of the vote, but her fans call those numbers \"an outrage,\" \"totally illegal!\"",
    "On guns: \"That's how we're free...Show me the research where crimes are committed with armed people.\"",
    "Father God, please make these crooked paths STRAIGHT for Your Glory in the Mighty Name of Jesus!",
    "And on her first day as Governor, \"I will move to DEMOLISH the Demonic plans of our enemy.",
    "and a plot by the ghost of Hugo Chavez: \"These evil people will stop at nothing!\"",
    "Shame on the blowbackers: \"Twisting the minds of Generation Z MUST END!\"",
    "Does she want CRT, social-emotional learning, sex education in schools?",
    "It's inscribed with tenets: Maintain humanity in balance with nature.",
    "And the land is going to be feral (sic) because of the chemicals.\"",
    "It's a battle far greater than what we see in (unintelligible).\"",
    "Prize truth, beauty, love, seeking harmony with the infinite.",
    "Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.",
