    "More importantly, though, is that a press release for the documentary notes that the documentary relies \"on the 990 forms non-profit groups must file with the Internal Revenue Service,\" and \"traces the river of cash flowing from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to a pair of 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations, the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) and the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR).",

    "The press release also features statements from key figures about just how big this project was when it comes to Zuckerberg's influence in the 2020 election:\nWell follow the money and uncover the startling facts behind Election 2020,? says Citizens United President David N. Bossie, who hosts and narrates Rigged.",
    "We want to make sure that people feel comfortable coming to the poll, but thats not what they ended up doing.?\nInstead, the funds were used to increase mail-in voting and drop boxes, to hire and train poll workers, to expand voter registration efforts, and to encourage people to vote early and by mail.",
    "However, records indicate that this statistic is enormously, and perhaps purposely, misleading, because of the approximately 160 grants of $400,000 or more - totaling some $270 million - an incredible 92 percent of those funds went to jurisdictions carried by Joe Biden in 2020.",
    "\"Rigged\" will address the cash flow from CTCL and CEIR in those states, where Biden's combined margin of victory was at about 42,000 votes, and which were key in handing Biden an electoral victory and the election.",

    "Also on Thursday, Citizens United President David Bossie went on Fox News' \"Hannity\" to promote a new documentary, \"Rigged: The Zuckerberg-Funded Plot to Defeat Donald Trump.\"",
    "Bossie will host and narrate the film, which will premiere at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, on April 5, which is when it will also be available for download.",
    "In short, with the huge majority of the money supporting jurisdictions won by Joe Biden, the effort amounted to an enormous get-out-the-vote campaign in key Democrat areas.",
    "On a locality-by-locality basis, government was not a neutral player,? says Ken Cuccinelli, National Chairman of the Election Transparency Initiative.",
    "I think we can look straight in the eye of Mark Zuckerberg and all these left-wing groups that infiltrated the offices with half a billion dollars.",
    "Joel Benenson, the chief strategist for Hillary Clintons 2016 campaign, has also been employed by the Chan Zuckerberg Institute as an advisor.",
    "This is all about the great intention of, hey, were gonna make it more secure,? Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry says in Rigged.",
    "While tweets from those in the mainstream media, such as CNN's Jim Acosta, delight in mocking the film, Bossie has responded in kind.",
