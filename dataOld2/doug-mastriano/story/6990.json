    "In a 2019 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network in Jerusalem, Pompeo was asked whether Trump was raised for such a time as this, just like Queen Esther, to help save the Jewish people from the Iranian menace??\nEsther is, according to Jo Carruthers, a professor at Lancaster University in Great Britain, a character type that can be applied at will.? This malleability dates back to antiquity, when the original Hebrew book, also known as the Masoretic Text and probably written in the 4th century B.C., was later amended to include religious elements obviously absent from the original version.",
    "In writing about what she called the pious makeover? of the Greek text, Amy Merrill Willis, a religion professor at the University of Lynchburg, said the revisions undermined the narrative power of the Hebrew version by reducing or eliminating the moral complexities faced by the characters.? The contemporary politicization of the Book of Esther, like its historical antecedents, does the same.",
    "Because Purim is a carnival, satirical and joyous, a time for dressing up and drinking heavily, a topsy-turvy combination of Halloween, Mardi Gras and the classic Jewish holiday definition of they tried to kill us, we won, lets eat.?\nThe biblical character of Esther plays a starring role in the eponymous book that is chanted that evening and again the next day.",
    "The Bible makes it clear that Esther was placed in her influential position for such a time as this  Gods purpose was accomplished through Esther in the dangerous and uncertain time in which she lived,? Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America, a socially conservative evangelical Christian womens political group, said in an email.",
    "The emphasis is on her being a good girl, pious, working within the system.?\nThat model still remains for activists like Nance at CWA, who said she often thinks of Esther when I sit across that table from a man or woman with great power, whether the president, a senator or a wealthy business leader.",
    "In that moment, I think that no matter what happens, I must make an appeal for the lives of the least of these.?\nNance and her organization disavowed the violence committed at the Capitol on Jan. 6 (though she did equate what happened there with the racial justice protests in Kenosha, Wis.).",
    "The Esther moment? was invoked by a protester at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to describe the religious fervor propelling her and others in a fight of good versus evil.? Others seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election have also claimed the mantle of that moment.",
    "There is, Carruthers said in an email, a huge difference between Jewish and Christian interpretation (and evident in evangelical circles) between a book where God is absent for Jews largely, and where God is not only present but interventionist for Catholics and evangelical Christians.",
    "As Jews gather on Wednesday evening to celebrate the holiday of Purim  and with covid-19 restrictions lifting in many areas, in-person gatherings may actually be possible  a carnival atmosphere will return to many synagogues that have been quiet and somber for the last two years.",
    "The fact that its the only book of the Bible with no divine reference has made it an important book in post-Holocaust Jewish theology.?\nBut this complexity is precisely whats lost when the Esther story is simplistically superimposed on contemporary politics.",
    "This story is often stripped of its innate complexities to focus on Esther herself, as someone who is explicitly chosen to carry out Gods will (even though the name of God does not appear anywhere in the Hebrew text).",
    "Esther has evolved to become a secret stand-in for the divine purpose, used by leaders to justify their political decisions and to imply that God is on their side, even if the rest of us cant see it.",
    "Both Esther and Mordechai engage in questionable behavior to achieve their goals, and the books violent coda  when the Jews kill 75,000 Persians, supposedly in self-defense  remains controversial.",
    "In Jewish tradition, she is also a complicated figure, both obedient and bold, who grows from clueless to cunning when forced to hide her identity as an endangered minority in the royal court.",
    "But over the centuries, the Esther story has come to represent a different sort of tale for many Christians  as other Jewish texts and rituals have been repurposed by evangelicals.",
    "Only Mordechai, her adoptive father, knows who she truly is and persuades her to act against the vizier Haman, who plots to kill all the Jews and ends up in the gallows instead.",
    "Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox Christians codified the additions; ironically, Protestants initially did not and Jews, of course, have always stuck to the original text.",
    "In May, he told the New Yorker that if we get the call, were not going to stand away from our Esther moment.? (He did not respond to questions from The Washington Post.)",
    "Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo is just one acolyte who portrayed former president Donald Trump as a modern-day embodiment of Esther during Trumps administration.",
    "She is the orphaned Disney princess, an attractive young woman who, after winning a beauty contest to become queen of Persia, courageously acts to save her people.",
    "One is Doug Mastriano, a Pennsylvania state senator running for governor, who has been subpoenaed by the congressional committee looking into the Capitol attacks.",
    "Esther becomes a pious Jewess who disdains her marriage to the king (a non-Jew), eats only kosher food and does not drink wine used for libations to pagan gods.",
    "Some modern feminists argue the true heroine is not Esther, but her predecessor, Vashti, who refused to obey the king and probably lost her life because of it.",
    "Its become almost like a meme, to do this heroic, righteous thing,? observed Timothy Beal, professor of religion at Case Western Reserve University.",
    "Like Esther, we believe God uses willing and courageous women like us to accomplish His purposes on earth.?\nBut some take the notion further.",
    "It is explicitly more theological in nature,? Jon D. Levenson, professor of Jewish studies at Harvard University, explained in an interview.",
    "In the new edition, known variously as the Greek or Septuagint Text and written a couple of centuries later, Gods presence is now explicit.",
    "But over time, Esther was embraced in Protestant writings, says Carruthers, who published The Politics of Purim? in 2020.",
    "The term Esther moment? has come to represent a moment when an unlikely woman is chosen by God to speak truth to power.",
    "No surprise, then, that in this polarizing climate, the politicization of Esther continues to even radical extremes.",
    "Christian evangelical women have long looked up to Esther as a symbol of appropriately behaved womens empowerment.",
    "Others have taken this biblical model of speaking truth to power as justification for overturning an election.",
    "In that context, Esther was the model of the deferential, beautiful, faithful woman,? he recalled.",
    "By allowing anyone and everyone to claim her crown, it dilutes the storys mystery and true power.",
    "Nonetheless, in the end, Purim is celebrated as a happy tale of communal survival.",
    "In this version, Esther is portrayed as more conventionally religious.",
    "Beal grew up in evangelical culture, though he is not part of it now.",
    "He has likened his political agenda to the Book of Esther.",
    "So was the Scottish nationalist figure Flora MacDonald.",
    "Queen Elizabeth I of England was likened to Esther.",
    "And more: Mordechai dreams and prays.",
    "Non-Jews are circumcised.",
    "Its a messy story."
