    "John Fetterman, the landslide Senate Democratic primary winner, refer to the GOP contest as a malicious, chaotic primary campaign to be the most extreme.?\nWhoever emerges? as Fettermans opponent, Biden added, will be too dangerous, too craven, and too extreme to represent Pennsylvania in the United States Senate.?\nBidens statement was a welcome sign that he and Democrats may be embracing the idea that the most important issue on Novembers ballot  in Pennsylvania, but also nationally  will be the extremism that has seized the Republican Party.",
    "He is an ardent 2020 election denier  insurrectionist,? my Post colleague Greg Sargent argues, is not too strong a word  who attended Trumps rally that preceded the Jan. 6 riot, organized buses to take Pennsylvanians to it and wanted the state legislature to overturn the popular vote for electors committed to Joe Biden.",
    "As the Wall Street Journals conservative columnist Gerard Baker wrote this week, if hes a genuine populist, Im the patriarch of Constantinople.?\nThe fact the race was so close reflected the strength of rival candidate Kathy Barnette, a conservative media personality who campaigned extensively with Mastriano.",
    "He spoke at a QAnon event last month, at which conspiracy theorists presented him with a ceremonial weapon they called the sword of David.?\nYes, democracy itself will be on the ballot this fall when Mastriano faces state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the Democratic nominee.",
    "And it underscores the virulence of the Trumpist contagion that a candidate such as Mastriano can win going away on the basis of a direct assault on democracy  even as a feckless GOP establishment proves itself powerless to stop a candidacy it knows is lethal.",
    "In the states marquee contest for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination, only a tiny fraction of the vote separates the Trump pick, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick.",
    "As important, non-Trump candidates of the McCormick stripe are forced to demean themselves by claiming to honor a man who plainly despises them and to pretend allegiance to his worldview.",
    "Trump-backed Rep. Ted Budd won the Senate nomination in North Carolina by more than a 2-to-1 margin over a former governor, but didnt Rep. Madison Cawthorn, another Trump favorite, lose?",
    "The most important and frightening outcome is the decision of Pennsylvanias Republicans  by a big margin  to make extremist state Sen. Doug Mastriano their partys nominee for governor.",
    "Republican voters in Nebraska last week and in Idaho on Tuesday declined to entrust their partys gubernatorial nominations to Trump favorites, but both were extremely weak candidates.",
    "The bottom line is that Trump was strong enough to drag the unlikely Oz candidacy close to the finish line  despite the split vote on the far right  and to clear the way for Budd.",
    "Barnette, an authentic radical right voice, won a quarter of the vote, roughly seven points behind the two leaders, and likely took more votes from Oz than from McCormick.",
    "Those looking for positive signs pointing to a bit of Republican independence will be eager to point out that Trumps endorsement does not guarantee victory.",
    "As my Post colleague Dana Milbank reported this week, a new study has found that 1 in 5 Republican state legislators are affiliated with far-right groups.",
    "Well, sure, but Cawthorn was burdened with so many scandals you could barely keep track of them  and he was defeated by less than two percentage points.",
    "Mastriano said he would reset? the states voters rolls so everyone would have to re-register.?\nThat this may be illegal does not deter Mastriano.",
    "What matters most about Tuesdays Republican primaries is not the scoresheet of how well candidates endorsed by former president Donald Trump did.",
    "McCormick, who served in the George W. Bush administration, tried desperately to recast himself in the Trumpian mold, but it sure looked fake.",
    "Ideologies that were once marginal and beyond the pale are now so important in the GOP that establishmentarians (hedge fund managers even!)",
    "He is so radical that Trump did not endorse him until three days before the primary, when polls showed he was likely to win.",
    "The latest returns showed Mastriano with 44 percent, to 20 percent for former congressman Lou Barletta, his nearest rival.",
    "It is delicious, by the way, that the GOP primary may be decided by those mail-in ballots that Trump so despises.",
    "In a state where the governor appoints the secretary of state who oversees elections.",
    "Here we go again,? Trump posted on his social media platform on Wednesday.",
