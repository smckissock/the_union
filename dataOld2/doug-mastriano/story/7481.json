    "If they decide, instead, these candidates, I'm going to focus on the 2020 election being rigged, I'm going to focus on Donald Trump and showing my loyalty to Donald Trump, polling shows that that is a terrible decision, because independent voters overwhelmingly  just 24 percent of them say, yes, we want a candidate for  a Republican candidate for Congress who's going to focus on the 2020 election.",
    "You have someone like Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania, who is  part of his stock and trade and what made him a promising candidate for the Republicans is and what got him Trump's endorsement is his really strong commitment to the big lie, the fact that he went on January 6 to Washington, D.C., and marched toward the Capitol, though he says he didn't go in or he didn't break the law.",

    "So you have candidates who are going to make it past the primary, who are going to be the party's nominee who may or may not have Trump's backing, but absolutely support the idea of only taking the votes that you want or of only accepting the result that is the result that you like.",
    "To Tam's point, if you have already gone and seen a movie, and you're convinced that that movie is right, there's nothing that is going to be shown in a hearing, which Republicans are going to say was completely political and completely biased to work.",
    "And even the candidates who are not openly saying that that they have the support of Donald Trump and that they should over  that the election results should be overturned say, well, there are questions, that there are doubts about the election.",

    "Now, it's much more complicated when you get into a presidential contest with Donald Trump vs. an incumbent governor that Donald Trump's trying to unseat.",
    "William Brangham:\nI mean, that's Pence's strategy, Amy  but  Tamara, but the  we always get a bit of grief for talking about the former president a lot.",

    "We're talking about signatures, all the things we heard about during the 2020 election.",
