    "But now, less than two years after taking part in efforts to prevent the certifications of both those wins, Mastriano appears poised to become the Republican gubernatorial candidate, one of several right-wing radicals in key Pennsylvania primary races who could, if successful, be in position to do in 2024 what they wanted to dobut couldntin 2020.\nIts almost unthinkable,? Trump critic and former GOP Congressman Charlie Dent told the Washington Post, that this is where we are.?\nIndeed, the Republican field of candidates seeking to be Pennsylvania governor or to represent the state in the United States Senate is a veritable clown show of conspiracy theorists and political extremists.",
    "Dr. Oz secured the former presidents coveted endorsement in that race, but the other two have plenty of MAGA clout themselves: McCormick, a hedge-fund manager whod previously denounced the January 6 attack, has since added two former Trump staffersHope Hicks and Stephen Millerto his campaign team; Barnette, meanwhile, was not only present for that rally-turned insurrectionshe was pictured marching to the Capitol with a member of the far-right extremist Proud Boys, NBC News confirmed on Monday.",
    "How do you find points of agreement,? the board wrote, referring to Republicans refusal to accept the 2020 election results, when you cant reach common ground on facts so basic that they could be used in field sobriety test??\nAmid the rise of Mastrianoand a late surge by Barnettetheres been some familiar handwringing among Republicans, some of whom have expressed worry that these more brazenly extremist candidates would struggle in a general election this fall.",
    "The forthcoming Supreme Court decision on Dobbs v. Jackson raises the stakes further: If the conservative majority, which Trump helped solidify, indeed overturns Roe v. Wade, the person sitting in the governors mansion could impose dramatic restrictions on abortion in the state; as the Philadelphia Inquirer pointed out last week, Mastriano has promised to ban the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, while some of his competitors would go ever farther.",
    "He has revealed the Deceit, Corruption, and outright Theft of the 2020 Presidential Election,? Trump said in a statement, and will do something about it.?\nIf that endorsement reads like a threat, thats because it is: Should one of these extremists rise to a position of power, they would be in position to enact anti-voting legislation and potentially to exert control over the election process in 2024, when Trump is expected to run again.",
    "Three weeks after the 2020 election was called for Joe Biden, Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano introduced a resolution to throw out the results of the popular vote and to have the Republican-controlled state chambers appoint their own electorsones that would presumably hand the state to Donald Trump, who was cheated? out of reelection through a corrupt? election process, he said.",
    "Mastriano, who has campaigned with Barnette and appeared near the Capitol steps as the Stop the Steal? protest descended into violence, was rewarded for his efforts to subvert democracy with a Trump endorsement on Saturday.",
    "In the gubernatorial primary, the Trump-endorsed Mastriano leads a roster of Republicans who have each backed Trumps fraud claims and would, if elected, move to roll back voting rights.",
    "Mastriano has even said he would try to require voters to re-register? in order to root out supposed fraud, despite it being clear there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election.",
    "In the race for retiring Republican Pat Toomeys Senate seat, Mehmet Oz, Kathy Barnette, and David McCormick are elbowing to prove themselves the true America First? candidate.",
    "He was at the insurrection, and hes poised to be my opponent in this governors race,? Democratic candidate Josh Shapiro said after Trump endorsed Mastriano.",
    "Obviously, were going to need the support of the leaders of the House and Senate.?\nHe didnt get that support: Biden won Pennsylvaniaand the presidency.",
    "A lot of people have moved on? from Trumps 2020 election loss, former Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman Robert Gleason told the Post.",
    "Were going to seat the electors,? Mastriano said in a November 2020 appearance on the podcast of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon.",
    "It is a sad state of affairs,? the Inquirer wrote in an editorial, declining to endorse any GOP candidate in the two primary races.",
    "But in the funhouse mirror of the contemporary GOP, it could wind up being an advantage.",
    "What is clear, though, is that it will be detrimental to the country if elected.",
    "Such a revelation, on the eve of a primary election, would seem disqualifying.",
    "They need to get over that or it will be detrimental to the party.? Will it?",
    "Were going to start all over again,? he said in an April debate.",
    "Thats the modern day Republican party.?",
    "Were going to take our power back.",
    "That much remains to be seen."
