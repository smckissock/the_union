    "He has made it clear he believes the 2020 election was rigged, and he would have put his own electors in place if he were governor.?\nThis is not just about the big lie,? Shapiro said, noting that this formulation undersells the degree to which Mastriano poses a danger to democracy.?\nSome might dismiss that as a partisan argument.",
    "During Trumps 2020 effort to steal the election, Mastriano explicitly endorsed the idea that the state legislature has sole authority? to reappoint new electors, given mounting evidence? that Joe Bidens win was compromised.?\nIt wasnt actually compromised,? of course.",
    "This is deeply worrisome: It means Mastriano could soon have the power to help execute a version of the scheme he endorsed  certifying electors in direct defiance of the states popular-vote outcome, based on bogus claims that this outcome was compromised.",
    "What must be conveyed clearly and unflinchingly is this: If Mastriano wins the general election, there is almost certainly no chance that a Democratic presidential candidates victory in Pennsylvania in 2024 will be certified by the states governor.",
    "Mastriano declares widespread fraud, whats to stop his handpicked secretary of state from certifying the GOP candidate as winner, after which he could sign certification of that candidates electors?",
    "This functionally means that Mastriano adheres to the notion that the mere claim of fraud is enough to justify the certification of presidential electors in defiance of the popular-vote outcome.",
    "But thats exactly the problem: A clear rendering of the situation, based on Mastrianos own declared positions, seems so outlandish that its easy to dismiss as mere partisan posturing.",
    "At the time, he also essentially declared his support for the notion that the popular vote can be treated as non-binding when it comes to the certification of presidential electors.",
    "As a state senator, Mastriano played a lead role in Donald Trumps effort to overturn his 2020 presidential loss, and the states next governor could be pivotal to a 2024 coup rerun.",
    "How should the media cover a candidate who is running for a position of control over our election machinery  and has also displayed an open eagerness to steal elections?",
    "He even pushed the Justice Department to accept this, at the moment when Trump wanted the department to announce fraud to create a pretext to overturn his loss.",
    "Similarly, CNN editor Alex Koppelman attracted attention this week by suggesting that the media may be falling short of this mission in a general sense.",
    "Some accounts note that as governor, Mastriano would appoint the next secretary of state, who would exert great control over the election process.",
    "The state legislature exercised its constitutional role in determining the manner? of appointing electors by passing a law creating this process.",
    "In Pennsylvania, the secretary of state certifies the election results, and the governor signs the certification of the winners electors.",
    "But theres something more nefarious about Mastriano than those basic facts convey when it comes to the true threat to democracy he poses.",
    "We need journalists to project forward in their imaginations to how these disasters for democracy would actually unfold,? Rosen told me.",
    "In this context, Rosen continued, journalists should ask themselves whether their renderings of the present capture those possibilities.",
    "That is what is at stake,? Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who is running for governor as a Democrat, told me.",
    "He pointedly asked colleagues if theyre conveying what they know? about the possibility of a stolen 2024 election.",
    "Much of the coverage of Mastrianos surge  see here, here and here  doesnt quite capture this underlying reality.",
    "Mastriano is now running for a position that exerts real control over the process of certifying electors.",
    "Republicans fear he could secure the nomination, because he might be a weak general-election candidate.",
    "This question arises now that Doug Mastriano is surging in the GOP primary for Pennsylvania governor.",
    "But for now, it should be asked: Is the media clearly conveying to voters the choice they face?",
    "As governor, he would be in a good position to help operationalize this very principle.",
    "Mastriano is running for governor on the very idea that Trumps loss was compromised.",
    "If the Democratic contender wins the popular vote in Pennsylvania in 2024, and Gov.",
    "Yes, those pieces tell us Mastriano played a key role in Trumps 2020 theft effort.",
    "This basic situation is reflected in some media coverage of Mastrianos surge.",
    "He asked: Are voters being given a clear picture of the choice ahead??",
    "Mastriano didnt just try to help Trump overturn the election.",
    "But forecasters note that in a bad enough year, he could win.",
    "Of course, Mastriano might lose the general election.",
    "But Mastriano continued to insist it was.",
    "Consider Mastrianos own words.",
    "Or he might lose the primary.",
    "But its also insufficient.",
    "All of that is important."
