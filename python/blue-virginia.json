Such incredible diversity comes with unmatched assets and <strong>we can<\/strong> <strong>face its challenges optimistically<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>My own grandfather brought his family to Fairfax County because he believed in what its schools could offer his children. The loving teachers at (then) Jeb Stuart High School transformed his son from a child who spoke no word of English living in a two-bedroom home of his parents and seven siblings to one of Georgetown&rsquo;s top-ten most successful graduates. His love for this community and what its schools did for him led him to choose to make Fairfax County home for us. His story and my mother&rsquo;s experiences teaching disadvantaged youth as a professor in the local community college made me always believe in our potential to do more here. It made me imagine the unharnessed potential that lies in every child.<\/p>\n<p><b>I remember when my own parents, before enrolling us at Mantua ES, moved us from one area to another in this very same county because of the difference in what would been offered to us under another zip code<\/b>. Most of my friends were not as lucky. Even in my new school, I remember seeing many of them struggle in classes that their parents could not afford additional support for. <strong>It concerned me that the possibility for a student to succeed relied on more than their effort and intellect <\/strong>because I know that it was my journey through <strong>Mantua ES, Frost MS, and Robinson SS<\/strong> that made it possible for me to make it to Yale and become a professional.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I carry these human stories with me.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ten years ago, these human stories inspired a friend and me to start a completely youth-led, youth-run non-profit organization that has been<b> providing free tutoring and mentorship to lower-income youth in twenty centers across the county for the past ten years<\/b> (<a href=\"http://www.giveyouth.org/\">www.giveyouth.org<\/a>). I became interested in improving access on a policy level and served as the <strong>President of the Superintendent&rsquo;s Advisory Council <\/strong>where we developed School Board policy recommendations on 21st century learning. I continued to learn about and partake in the School Board policy process when serving on <strong>three School Board advisory committees<\/strong>, one of which chose our superintendent. In addition to having served as a <b>peer mental health counselor<\/b>, <b>FCPS substitute teacher<\/b>, and working<strong> for the FCPS Superintendent&rsquo;s Office<\/strong>, I carried forward the <b>values that Girl Scouting instilled in me<\/b> forward to dedicate my Gold Award project to an <strong>anti-bullying campaign that amended our own FCPS policies<\/strong>. I have have an appetite for understanding these challenges thoroughly and for doing what we can for that child whose parents work too many jobs to be an advocate because the alternative would be no dinner on the table.<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, I am someone who has worked in several levels of government and policy-making and who has been a part of generating real solutions tested on the ground. As you remember, my team ran an <strong>exceptional campaign<\/strong> in the short special election of June 2017. Since then, we have been developing <strong>relationships with the<\/strong> <strong>VA Department of Education, the UVA Curry School of Education, and the Yale Institute of Social and Policy Studies,<\/strong> specifically to focus on FCPS and to generate informed policy proposals through these partnerships over the coming months. We are thrilled about what we will learn and use to inform effective policy. I serve as <strong>Chairman Bulova&rsquo;s commissioner and as School Board member Dalia Palchik&rsquo;s appointee<\/strong> and <strong>co-chair to the new School Board human resources advisory committee<\/strong> on teacher retention.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As a second-generation FCPS graduate who has spent the past ten years serving families<\/strong> <b>and building relationships countywide<\/b>, I am proud to be running in a cohort of advocates across Fairfax who have been tirelessly working together and supporting each other on education issues long before the race even started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I am especially pleased to announce this decision after conversations with numerous education leaders, party district chairs, and senior elected officials from whom I have wide support <\/strong>that I will be announcing more specifically in the days to come. Below is one such example.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Abrar Omeish is an extraordinary example of what the future can be for all of us. This is a young woman who is <strong>not only highly intelligent and well-educated, but has the courage of her convictions<\/strong>. I know because she worked for me and <strong>stood out as a person with all the characteristics of leadership that you could possibly hope to find<\/strong> in a person of her age.

His love for this community and what its schools did for him led him to choose to make Fairfax County home for us. His story and my mother\u2019s experiences teaching disadvantaged youth as a professor in the local community college made me always believe in our potential to do more here. It made me imagine the unharnessed potential that lies in every child.\nI remember when my own parents, before enrolling us at Mantua ES, moved us from one area to another in this very same county because of the difference in what would been offered to us under another zip code. Most of my friends were not as lucky. Even in my new school, I remember seeing many of them struggle in classes that their parents could not afford additional support for. It concerned me that the possibility for a student to succeed relied on more than their effort and intellect because I know that it was my journey through Mantua ES, Frost MS, and Robinson SS that made it possible for me to make it to Yale and become a professional.\nI carry these human stories with me.\nTen years ago, these human stories inspired a friend and me to start a completely youth-led, youth-run non-profit organization that has been providing free tutoring and mentorship to lower-income youth in twenty centers across the county for the past ten years (www.giveyouth.org). I became interested in improving access on a policy level and served as the President of the Superintendent\u2019s Advisory Council where we developed School Board policy recommendations on 21st century learning. I continued to learn about and partake in the School Board policy process when serving on three School Board advisory committees, one of which chose our superintendent. In addition to having served as a peer mental health counselor, FCPS substitute teacher, and working for the FCPS Superintendent\u2019s Office, I carried forward the values that Girl Scouting instilled in me forward to dedicate my Gold Award project to an anti-bullying campaign that amended our own FCPS policies. I have have an appetite for understanding these challenges thoroughly and for doing what we can for that child whose parents work too many jobs to be an advocate because the alternative would be no dinner on the table.\nLooking ahead, I am someone who has worked in several levels of government and policy-making and who has been a part of generating real solutions tested on the ground. As you remember, my team ran an exceptional campaign in the short special election of June 2017. Since then, we have been developing relationships with the VA Department of Education, the UVA Curry School of Education, and the Yale Institute of Social and Policy Studies, specifically to focus on FCPS and to generate informed policy proposals through these partnerships over the coming months. We are thrilled about what we will learn and use to inform effective policy. I serve as Chairman Bulova\u2019s commissioner and as School Board member Dalia Palchik\u2019s appointee and co-chair to the new School Board human resources advisory committee on teacher retention.\nAs a second-generation FCPS graduate who has spent the past ten years serving families and building relationships countywide, I am proud to be running in a cohort of advocates across Fairfax who have been tirelessly working together and supporting each other on education issues long before the race even started.\nI am especially pleased to announce this decision after conversations with numerous education leaders, party district chairs, and senior elected officials from whom I have wide support that I will be announcing more specifically in the days to come. Below is one such example.\n\u201cAbrar Omeish is an extraordinary example of what the future can be for all of us. This is a young woman who is not only highly intelligent and well-educated, but has the courage of her convictions. I know because she worked for me and stood out as a person with all the characteristics of leadership that you could possibly hope to find in a person of her age. I strongly endorse her for the School Board because she both has the perspective of the students but the maturity of the parents and administrators.\u201d \u2013 Congressman Moran\nHaving served as a beneficiary, partner, advocate, and advisor to both the administrative and political sides of FCPS, I bring the perspectives of our many stakeholders to the School Board. Coupled with my personal experience as well as my robust policy and leadership background in the last ten years, I would be a strong voice for equitable education and young people in Fairfax County as I naturally transition to the School Board.\nI am also proud to be a friend who shares your values. From my time as co-president of VA High School Young Dems to my work at the DNC securing our 2017 victories and at the doors in the recent election, I have been there.\nI want to continue building on this work and on the efforts already put forth. I cannot do this alone. I ask for your support.\nDonate: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/abrarforschoolboard\nVolunteer: https://goo.gl/forms/kDobTKvSK9vtiQ2n1\nLike/Share/Follow our page: https://www.facebook.com/AbrarforSchoolBoard\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/abraromeish\nWebsite: www.abraromeish.com","resolvedPageUrl":"http://bluevirginia.us/2019/01/53241","authors":[{"name":"Blue Virginia","link":"http://bluevirginia.us/author/Blue-Virginia"}],"docId":144189020645,"fromSeedUrl":"https://bluevirginia.us/","seedUrlHash32":3208478875,"parentUrlDocId":245640698347,"gburl":"http://bluevirginia.us/?p=53241-diffbotxyz3613419594","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1547090174,"timestamp":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 03:16:14 GMT"}

Unfortunately, &ldquo;biological sex&rdquo; has become a dog-whistle (used by the Trump administration) as a stand-in for &ldquo;real sex,&rdquo; in order to erase transgender people. Also not preferred for the same reason are &ldquo;anatomical sex,&rdquo; &ldquo;physiological sex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;natal sex.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It is worth noting that one objection (posited by those opposed to acceptance of LGBTQ people) to the information on PrEP is that it is not currently suggested for minors. While that is true, the medicines themselves are approved for children age 12 and up; and besides, we teach much in school that children will use in their adult lives. We teach 7th graders about marriage without expecting them to rush out and get married. The reality is that inevitably, some of our students, at some point in their lives, will be at very high risk. Knowing about PrEP could be essential to their health.<\/p>\n<p>Another stated objection to PrEP is that it will increase the incidence of risky behavior. This is demonstrated as not true. In fact, research indicates that people taking PrEP do not acquire other sexually transmitted infections at greater rates, but that the rate of transmission of HIV is reduced by 90%. <a data-ft=\"{\" data-lynx-mode=\"asynclazy\" href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736%252815%252900056-2%2Fabstract&h=ATN29YjULdwBMzgECjDBH-8ekUuZuIgATDiOAXpMkqtvzkPhKdV2fioxNKWCjM4ooKqb3jqEjjh4uN93Wr_cimCTEcG_4mUEf9tFugFZJcgVDCjoC0AT5eJ5FOUCbUSgu6AIGPBjZSs9jACPwrw\">http://www.thelancet.com/&hellip;/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2900&hellip;/abstract<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The board is voting on these topics on Thursday June 14.<br>\n We expect many people in opposition at that meeting.

The meeting is at Luther Jackson Middle School in Merrifield (3020 Gallows Rd.) at 7 p.m., but it is recommended that you arrive about 30 or 40 minutes early, to get rainbow flags and pink signs from us in the lobby, and to be sure to get a seat in the auditorium. No signs larger than 8 &frac12; X 11 are allowed. We ask that people not engage in debate in the lobby with opponents. It serves little purpose, and only increases tensions. Also, avoid interviews with media you do not recognize as mainstream. It is very easy for an outlet to edit your words to fit a particular narrative that you may not intend.<\/p>\n<p>On other notes, FCPS Pride will have booths at Reston Pride on June 2 and Capital Pride on June 10.

But, in listening to his comments about the Family Life Education Curriculum Advisory Committee last night, I am troubled.<\/p>\n<p>First, Mr. Wilson asks the question: &ldquo;Do we as an organization still believe in Biology?&rdquo; I hear that question as &ldquo;Do we think transgender people are real?&rdquo; The answer is, yes, we believe in biological and medical science, and they tell us that Gender Identity is real and that transgender people are who they say they are. The data are in, and the mainstream professional and scientific organizations are universal in their concurrence on this. All the rest is the same anti-scientific smoke and mirrors, backed up by obfuscatory pseudo-science promoted by organizations with demonstrated animus towards LGBTQ people. I am alarmed to hear that Mr. Wilson, so honorable a man, has been co-opted by that narrative.<\/p>\n<p>Even worse, he spoke of an online report purported to describe the parliamentary process. He was in fact quoting an article called &ldquo;Sex Ed and Stalinism at the Local School Board&rdquo; by C-FAM president Austin Ruse, that describes the school board as &ldquo;leftist&rdquo; and snidely says that the student representatives were &ldquo;no doubt chosen because they are members of LGBT student groups.&rdquo; This by adults? Are these the parent voices Mr. Wilson wants represented, that use inflammatory language and make innuendo about children? Mr. Wilson goes on to say that the committee meetings were video-taped by the audience and are now posted on-line. He is endorsing intimidation tactics by well-funded national groups intended to alarm committee members, and reporting on the posting of videos on blogs so hateful that, if they were done by a school employ, would get anyone fired.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Wilson, you are flirting with some very disreputable actors unrestrained by decency. Back off, before your own reputation is damaged.<\/p>","text":"So pathetic; see the video, below, for Fairfax County Public School (FCPS) Board\u2019s two Republican members\u2019 (the faaaar-right Elizabeth Schultz and the not-quite-as-far-right-but-still-godawful Thomas Wilson) comments last night on Fairfax County Public Schools\u2019 \u201cFamily Life Education\u201d (FLE) program and on the Family Life Education Curriculum Advisory Committee (FLECAC).

A note to your school board member for \u201ccitizen quotes\u201d can\u2019t hurt (also remember to include Ryan McElveen, Ilryong Moon and Karen Keys-Gamarra, who represent everyone). https://www.fcps.edu/inde\u2026/school-board/school-board-members\nBut, if you can\u2019t do it this weekend, any time before June 8 is good.\nThe two topics we are focusing on are\n1) using \u201cSex assigned at birth\u201d rather than \u201cbiological sex\u201d in discussing human sexuality, as being more inclusive of transgender students and family members; and\n2) informing high school students about PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), which is a medicine recommended by the Centers for Disease Control to reduce the rate of HIV infection by 90% in very high risk populations.\nThese are already in the recommended objectives, so we are asking the school board to adopt them as written.\nSend letters to flecomments@fcps.edu before June 8 close of business.\nYou may write one letter, or separate letters on the two subjects.\nYou may certainly add personal perspectives, or more information, in one or two letters.\nThe idea behind \u201csex assigned at birth\u201d is that it is the language currently used by all major American medical and allied health professional organizations, and in most recent court decisions, in describing that aspect of human sexuality. Unfortunately, \u201cbiological sex\u201d has become a dog-whistle (used by the Trump administration) as a stand-in for \u201creal sex,\u201d in order to erase transgender people. Also not preferred for the same reason are \u201canatomical sex,\u201d \u201cphysiological sex,\u201d and \u201cnatal sex.\u201d\nIt is worth noting that one objection (posited by those opposed to acceptance of LGBTQ people) to the information on PrEP is that it is not currently suggested for minors. While that is true, the medicines themselves are approved for children age 12 and up; and besides, we teach much in school that children will use in their adult lives. We teach 7th graders about marriage without expecting them to rush out and get married. The reality is that inevitably, some of our students, at some point in their lives, will be at very high risk. Knowing about PrEP could be essential to their health.\nAnother stated objection to PrEP is that it will increase the incidence of risky behavior. This is demonstrated as not true. In fact, research indicates that people taking PrEP do not acquire other sexually transmitted infections at greater rates, but that the rate of transmission of HIV is reduced by 90%. http://www.thelancet.com/\u2026/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2900\u2026/abstract\nThe board is voting on these topics on Thursday June 14.\nWe expect many people in opposition at that meeting. Please come and wear purple in support. The meeting is at Luther Jackson Middle School in Merrifield (3020 Gallows Rd.) at 7 p.m., but it is recommended that you arrive about 30 or 40 minutes early, to get rainbow flags and pink signs from us in the lobby, and to be sure to get a seat in the auditorium. No signs larger than 8 ½ X 11 are allowed. We ask that people not engage in debate in the lobby with opponents. It serves little purpose, and only increases tensions. Also, avoid interviews with media you do not recognize as mainstream. It is very easy for an outlet to edit your words to fit a particular narrative that you may not intend.\nOn other notes, FCPS Pride will have booths at Reston Pride on June 2 and Capital Pride on June 10. Stop by and visit. Look for more information soon on our Community Picnic in Vienna on July 15.\nUPDATE: More from Robert Norris Rigby\nI like and admire Tom Wilson, Sully representative to the Fairfax County School Board, even though we disagree on some crucial issues. But, in listening to his comments about the Family Life Education Curriculum Advisory Committee last night, I am troubled.\nFirst, Mr. Wilson asks the question: \u201cDo we as an organization still believe in Biology?\u201d I hear that question as \u201cDo we think transgender people are real?\u201d The answer is, yes, we believe in biological and medical science, and they tell us that Gender Identity is real and that transgender people are who they say they are. The data are in, and the mainstream professional and scientific organizations are universal in their concurrence on this. All the rest is the same anti-scientific smoke and mirrors, backed up by obfuscatory pseudo-science promoted by organizations with demonstrated animus towards LGBTQ people. I am alarmed to hear that Mr. Wilson, so honorable a man, has been co-opted by that narrative.\nEven worse, he spoke of an online report purported to describe the parliamentary process. He was in fact quoting an article called \u201cSex Ed and Stalinism at the Local School Board\u201d by C-FAM president Austin Ruse, that describes the school board as \u201cleftist\u201d and snidely says that the student representatives were \u201cno doubt chosen because they are members of LGBT student groups.\u201d This by adults? Are these the parent voices Mr. Wilson wants represented, that use inflammatory language and make innuendo about children? Mr. Wilson goes on to say that the committee meetings were video-taped by the audience and are now posted on-line. He is endorsing intimidation tactics by well-funded national groups intended to alarm committee members, and reporting on the posting of videos on blogs so hateful that, if they were done by a school employ, would get anyone fired.\nMr. Wilson, you are flirting with some very disreputable actors unrestrained by decency. Back off, before your own reputation is damaged.","resolvedPageUrl":"https://bluevirginia.us/2018/05/video-gop-fairfax-county-school-board-members-keep-losing-badly-on-family-life-education-but-wont-give-it-up","authors":[{"name":"lowkell","link":"https://bluevirginia.us/author/lowkell"}],"docId":155920620013,"fromSeedUrl":"https://bluevirginia.us/","seedUrlHash32":3208478875,"parentUrlDocId":49802615271,"gburl":"https://bluevirginia.us/?p=43115-diffbotxyz3111435724","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1547088937,"timestamp":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 02:55:37 GMT"}

I like Ryan McElveen a lot and will strongly consider supporting him for this position. How about you? Any favorites yet? One thing\u2019s for sure, Democrats need to win the chairmanship, whether against Pat Herrity or whatever other right wingnut the Fairfax Republicans nominate\u2026\nP.S. Abrar Omeish tells me she\u2019s now definitely running for the at-large Fairfax County School Board position\u2026\nRyan McElveen Launches Campaign for\nFairfax County Chairman\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nJanuary 5, 2019 Ryan McElveen Launches Campaign for Fairfax County Chairman\nPlatform Calls for Education, Innovation and Opportunity for AllMCLEAN, Va. \u2013 Fairfax County School Board Member At-Large Ryan McElveen launched his campaign for Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors with a video statement released on social media today.\u201cWhile Fairfax County is a wonderful place to live for many, it isn\u2019t working for everyone,\u201d McElveen said in the video. \u201cPast decisions have increased the stark divide between the haves and have-nots, effectively creating two Fairfaxes.\u201d\nMcElveen believes it is time for new, progressive leadership on the Board of Supervisors. To create a community that better serves all residents, as Board Chairman, McElveen will promote:\nuniversal pre-Kindergarten, so that every child in Fairfax County can be prepared to join a global workforce;\nan innovative and sustainable infrastructure, so that every community member has access to the internet; new transportation alternatives; and state-of-the-art schools, libraries and green space;\nopportunity for all members of the workforce, so that every Fairfax resident can achieve the American Dream and share in the wealth brought by new tech companies; and\nfiscal discipline, so that taxes are kept low while making these critical investments.\nMcElveen has represented all 1.15 million Fairfax County residents as an at-large member of the Fairfax County School Board since 2012. During his seven years on the School Board, he has worked with parents, students, and educators to keep the school system the best in the nation, while also restoring competitive compensation for teachers and implementing important reforms in the areas of student mental health supports, student discipline, later high school start times and full-day Mondays, and school safety and security. He has also promoted community accountability through the hiring of both a system ombudsman and auditor general.\nAdditionally, he has led the School Board in championing increased legislative advocacy so that Fairfax County receives its fair shake from Richmond, improved public engagement, curriculum internationalization, LGBTQ protections, gun violence prevention, and healthier food options.\nMcElveen also serves as associate director of The Brookings Institution\u2019s John L. Thornton China Center, where he is senior administrator, coordinates with the Brookings-Tsinghua Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and conducts research on Chinese politics and society and U.S. foreign policy.\nBorn in Tysons Corner, McElveen graduated from George C. Marshall High School. He holds a B.A. in Anthropology and East Asian Studies from the University of Virginia and a Master\u2019s of International Affairs in human rights from Columbia University.

And yeah, despite 2018 being a horrible year in the country, it was pretty good politically speaking for Virginia Democrats. Let\u2019s keep that going in 2019 and beyond!\nTim Kaine crushed neo-Confederate Corey Stewart 57%-41%, although frankly, it\u2019s VERY disturbing that 41% of Virginia voters would opt for a white nationalist, climate science denier, xenophobe, and self-described \u201cvicious\u201d campaigner over the level-headed, brilliant, experienced, knowledgeable, compassionate, sensible Tim Kaine. So\u2026good news that Kaine won by 16 points, but bad news that there are actually people willing to vote for someone as heinous as neo-Confederate Corey.\nDemocrats picked up three U.S. House seats (VA-02, VA-07, VA-10) and will take a 7-4 advantage in House delegation starting January 3, 2019.

In VA-01, for instance, Vangie Williams defeated two men (Edwin Santana and John Suddarth) for the Democratic nomination there. In VA-02, Elaine Luria defeated another woman, Karen Mallard, after several men failed to qualify for the ballot or dropped out. In VA-05, Leslie Cockburn crushed three male candidates (Andrew Snearthern, RD Huffstetler, Ben Cullop). In VA-06, Jennifer Lewis defeated two men (Peter Volosin, Sergio Coppola) and one other woman (Charlotte Moore) for the nomination there. In VA-07, Abigail Spanberger defeated Dan Ward 73%-27%. And in VA-10, Jennifer Wexton easily defeated five other primary candidates, including two men (Paul Pelletier, who finished second-to-last with just 3.8% of the vote, and Dan Helmer, who finished fourth with 12.6% of the vote). Sensing a pattern here?\nStrong opposition to the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley Pipeline \u2013 A significant movement against Dominion\u2019s Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Mountain Valley Pipeline grew during 2018. That included tree sits (\u201cRed\u201d and \u201cMinor\u201d Terry, etc.) and other protests of various kinds; statements and press conferences by Democratic elected officials, committees and candidates; court decisions (mostly against the pipelines); major controversy over Air Board replacements/who\u2019s allowed to vote on Dominion\u2019s proposed fracked-gas compressor station in Union Hill, etc., etc. Watch for a lot more of this in 2019.\nMedicaid expansion finally, at long last, passed the Virginia General Assembly and was signed into law by Gov. Ralph Northam. For anyone who ridiculously claims that elections don\u2019t matter, tell that to the hundreds of thousands of Virginians who will benefit from this.

Gerry Connolly\u2019s Chief of Staff, James Walkinshaw, announced for the seat. As of the moment, Walkinshaw is the only candidate \u2013 and the heavy favorite \u2013 for this seat.\nAlso on the Fairfax County Board, Providence District Supervisor Linda Smyth (D, kinda/sorta) announced she\u2019ll be retiring after her current term ends next year. I\u2019m hearing that multiple Democrats will be running to replace Smyth, including School Board member Dalia Palchik, Erika Yalowitz, Edythe Kelleher, Phillip Niedzielski-Eichner and possibly others.\nHaving served for over a decade, Fairfax County Board Chair Sharon Bulova (D) announced that she will retire after her current term ends next year. Lee District Supervisor Jeff McKay (D) announced he is running for that job, as does Tim Chapman (D). At least two candidates so far (Larysa Kautz and Rodney Lusk) have announced for McKay\u2019s seat.\nAmazon HQ2 announced it\u2019s coming to Virginia. And don\u2019t forget Micron\u2019s $3 billion expansion in Manassas! On the down side, Norfolk Southern is leaving Norfolk\u2026\nWith the victory of Matt de Ferranti over John Vihstadt (R/I), Arlington County Board will return to unanimous, 5-0 Democratic majority. For his part, Vihstadt is going out the same way he came in.\nDemocrat Babur Lateef was elected Prince William County School Board Chair over Republican Alyson Satterwhite. Yesterday, the State Board of Elections imposed a fine against former Prince William County Democratic Committee Chair Harry Wiggins regarding a \u201cpolitical action committee called Republicans for Stanley Bender.\u201d\nGeneral Assembly Republicans killed pretty much every single commonsense gun violence prevention measure. Why? Because they\u2019re crazy, of course (see here, for instance) and also because they are a wholly-owned subsidiary of the gun lobby.\nThe largest class \u2013 and by FAR most diverse \u2013 of freshmen House of Delegates Democrats was sworn in. That includes, among other things, the first transgender member of the Virginia General Assembly (Danica Roem), the first two Latina members (Elizabeth Guzman and Hala Ayala), etc. Great stuff \u2013 let\u2019s keep it going in 2019!\nThe \u201cracial packing\u201d lawsuit (\u201cBethune-Hill\u201d) moved along, with new maps submitted by the \u201cSpecial Master\u201d and Virginia House Republicans desperately trying to prevent non-racially-packed districts from being drawn, because, you know, they are not big fans of democracy.\nAG Mark Herring announced his intention to run for Governor in 2021. The question now is who else runs for Governor on the Democratic side \u2013 Justin Fairfax? Levar Stoney? others?\nVirginia FINALLY approved \u201chistoric\u201d funding for Metro, but thanks to Republicans like Del. Tim Hugo, the Metro funding wasn\u2019t as good as it should have been, while other transportation funding was messed up. In 2019, let\u2019s make sure we show Hugo the exit door (from the House of Delegates AND from messing around with Metro).\nThe year ended with the federal government shutting down, something that of course impacts Virginia, home of hundreds of thousands of federal employees.\nThe \u201cDominion Bill\u201d boondoggle passed the General Assembly, highlighting basically everything that\u2019s wrong with the \u201cVirginia Way.\u201d We need reform, badly, in terms of ethics, campaign finance, etc. etc.\nGeneral Assembly Republicans (mostly men) killed ERA ratification, for no good reason of course (and a LOT of crazy/bad \u201creasons\u201d). Fortunately, this fight isn\u2019t over \u2013 it\u2019s coming back big time in 2019, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s got a good shot of passing this time, given the tremendous popular support for this long-overdue amendment.","authors":[{"name":"lowkell","link":"https://bluevirginia.us/author/lowkell"}],"docId":72851888577,"fromSeedUrl":"https://bluevirginia.us/","seedUrlHash32":3208478875,"parentUrlDocId":239847807443,"gburl":"https://bluevirginia.us/2018/12/top-28-virginia-political-stories-of-2018-diffbotxyz201464368","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1547086950,"timestamp":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 02:22:30 GMT"}

Basically, right wingers like Schultz and Wilson are having difficulty with the concept that gender is not a strict binary, that sexuality and gender identity are not 1950s &ldquo;Father Knows Best&rdquo;style, black-and-white, simplistic things. Wilson, for instance, riffs about his mother asking him, <strong>&ldquo;after raising seven kids, could she still be a man?&rdquo;<\/strong> Wilson wants to know if &ldquo;we believe that,&rdquo; also <strong>&ldquo;could I be a mother at this point in my life at 52?&rdquo;<\/strong> Uhhh&hellip;something you want to share with us, Tom?<\/p>\n<p>As Fairfax County Public Schools teacher and FCPS Pride President <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robertrigbyjr\">Robert Norris Rigby wrote on Facebook<\/a> late last night (bolding added by me for emphasis):<\/p>\n<p>I caught the tail end of the Fairfax School Board meeting on video tonight, just in time to see Tom Wilson speak at length about the FLECAC (Family Life Education Curriculum Advisory Committee) process. All I could gather is that the FLE presentation was not given at the school board tonight; I don&rsquo;t know why.

Basically, right wingers like Schultz and Wilson are having difficulty with the concept that gender is not a strict binary, that sexuality and gender identity are not 1950s \u201cFather Knows Best\u201dstyle, black-and-white, simplistic things. Wilson, for instance, riffs about his mother asking him, \u201cafter raising seven kids, could she still be a man?\u201d Wilson wants to know if \u201cwe believe that,\u201d also \u201ccould I be a mother at this point in my life at 52?\u201d Uhhh\u2026something you want to share with us, Tom?\nAs Fairfax County Public Schools teacher and FCPS Pride President Robert Norris Rigby wrote on Facebook late last night (bolding added by me for emphasis):\nI caught the tail end of the Fairfax School Board meeting on video tonight, just in time to see Tom Wilson speak at length about the FLECAC (Family Life Education Curriculum Advisory Committee) process.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he was a bad governor, but I don't really understand how he believes he is relevant enough in the current political climate to make an impact.","type":"post"},{"date":"Sun, 06 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT","humanLanguage":"en","author":"lowkell","authorUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/lowkell/","diffbotUri":"post|3|1194810767","html":"<p>I'd say he's delusional, shallow and has a massive ego.

Second, unless Senate Republicans are willing to vote to convict, which is HIGHLY/EXTREMELY unlikely, impeachment isn\u2019t going to oust Trump from office. Third, I\u2019m not a big fan of the use of extreme profanity by our elected officials. Fourth, having said that, of course Trump has said as bad or worse over the years, and Republicans didn\u2019t seem to care, so spare us the faux \u201coutrage\u201d)\nLawmaker\u2019s Vow to Impeach Trump, With an Obscenity, Upends Democrats\u2019 Strategy (\u201cRepublicans pounced at the Michigan congresswoman\u2019s remarks to paint the majority as a power-hungry bloc intent on destroying the Trump presidency.\u201d)\nIt\u2019s About Time Democrats Said Something Without Worrying About What the Maniac President* Might Say (\u201cRashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say what they mean. Nancy Pelosi can handle that.\u201d)\nDems livid after Tlaib vows to \u2018impeach the motherf\u2014er\u2019 (\u201cParty leaders fear such explosive talk only gives ammunition to the GOP.\u201d I agree, this was really undisciplined and really not smart.)\nWSJ editorial shreds Trump\u2019s Afghanistan claims (\u201cA Wall Street Journal editorial published Friday ripped into President Donald Trump for comments he made about the Soviet Union\u2019s decadelong war in Afghanistan, blasting his \u2018reprehensible\u2019 recollection of the conflict and his \u2018slander\u2019 of U.S. allies.\u201d)\nHere\u2019s why Trump\u2019s praise of the Soviet Union for invading Afghanistan is dangerous (\u201cThe president discounts the massive toll the decade-long Soviet occupation took on the Afghan people.\u201d)\nDHS presents a PowerPoint on the \u2018crisis\u2019 on the border full of false, fear-mongering claims (\u201cThe only existing immigration crisis was created by the government.\u201d Correct.)\nSupreme Court will hear two challenges to partisan gerrymandering(\u201cThis will end badly.\u201d)\nElizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton and the sexist hypocrisy of the the \u2018likability\u2019 media narrative. Here we go again. (\u201cIn other words, Warren\u2019s expressed desire to potentially become America\u2019s most powerful politician has changed the calculus. After all, Hillary Clinton was a popular secretary of state; Warren is a popular senator. Research bears this out.\u201d)\nTalking About Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Likability is a Way to Tell Women to Sit Down and Shut Up (\u201cWomen are expected to be effortless, so the fact that Warren and Clinton\u2014who have little else in common\u2014are so evidently hard-working is considered damning instead of an asset.\u201d)\nBeto O\u2019Rourke Says He\u2019s \u201cSupportive of the Concept\u201d of a Green New Deal (\u201cThe former congressman is the latest potential 2020 contender to flirt with the sweeping climate policy.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt we need *something* like a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d the only questions are the details and political realities.)\nSean Hannity warns that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will stop rich people from buying boats and \u201ctaking expensive vacations\u201d (Untrue of course. What Ocasio-Cortez was talking about was something like the tax code we had for much of the 20th century in this country, where the super-rich theoretically paid a very high marginal tax rate above certain very high \u2013 millions \u2013 income levels.)\nClinton buddy McAuliffe: 50% chance I\u2019ll challenge Trump in 2020 (\u201cHe also discussed his claim that Democratic presidential candidates should avoid \u2018dishonest populism,\u2019 asserting he was not referring to Warren, when pressed by Melber, who noted she was currently the only candidate in the race.\u201d)\nTerry McAuliffe Is Right (If the conservative National Review says you\u2019re \u201cright,\u201d you\u2019re almost certainly wrong.)\nTrump denies that Jim Webb is under consideration for Defense secretary (Trump, in his usual style: \u201cThe story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I\u2019m sure he is a fine man, but I don\u2019t know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!\u201d)\nDem rep asks for asks for pay to be withheld during shutdown (\u201cFreshman Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) sent a letter Thursday to the House chief administrative officer asking for her pay to be withheld as a partial government shutdown drags on into a third week.\u201d)\nVirginia NAACP Files Powerful Comments on Dominion\u2019s Proposed Union Hill Compressor Station (\u201cThis \u2018appears to be a deliberate effort by the applicant, Dominion Energy, to erase the historic African American community of Union Hill from the record'\u201d)\nVa. House Republicans buck Northam with plan to maximize Trump tax savings (Do Republicans EVER want to invest in education, the environment and other important priorities? Of course not \u2013 they just want to give people, particularly those who don\u2019t need the money, tax cuts \u2013 Republicans\u2019 answer to everything including the common cold.)\nVirginia Republicans say taxpayers would save $440 million under their plan (We have pressing needs for that $440 million, including schools, environmental protection, and transit)\nSchapiro: Ahead of legislative session, both parties squeezed by the base (Behind the RTD\u2019s firewall, but just based on the title \u2013 \u201cboth parties,\u201d ugh \u2013 I have a feeling I\u2019m not going to like this one.)\nUSPS IG clears conservative group of wrongdoing in Spanberger file release (\u201cAt least 6 other former employees had their files improperly released after FOIA requests, IG found\u201d)\nThe FBI must wake from its deep slumber on the death of Bijan Ghaisar (Absolutely, this was totally outrage.)\nBob Marshall column: Don\u2019t waste time trying to resurrect the Equal Rights Amendment (Can someone please explain why newspapers feel the need to constantly give space to an extremist, bigot and all-around nutjob like \u201cSideshow Bob\u201d Marshall? I\u2019m losing track of how many variants of this assinine op-ed we\u2019ve been subjected to in recent weeks.)\n\u201cDisrespectful\u201d: Hampton Roads anglers are hoping Virginia puts a stop to roping fish (\u201cCulling, called roping in saltwater circles, can bloat the striper\u2019s stomach to make it heavier, but also tear apart its jaw and potentially drown it.\u201d Barbaric.)","authors":[{"name":"lowkell","link":"http://bluevirginia.us/author/lowkell"}],"docId":89145629147,"fromSeedUrl":"https://bluevirginia.us/","seedUrlHash32":3208478875,"parentUrlDocId":205534157272,"gburl":"http://bluevirginia.us/2019/01/saturday-news-trump-threatens-years-long-shutdown-for-border-wall-a-freshman-a-viral-video-and-a-profanity-revive-trump-impeachment-talk-tmac-says-50-50-shot-hell-run-for-president-trum-diffbotxyz527753909","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1547083629,"timestamp":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 01:27:09 GMT"}

Yesterday was a completely bonkers day in America; check out Jimmy Kimmel as he sums it up\nAmerican Bar Association Urges F.B.I. Inquiry Into Kavanaugh (\u201cThe American Bar Association called Thursday evening for postponing a vote on Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court until sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford and others are investigated by the F.B.I.\u201d)\nWhy Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Hearings Convinced Me That He\u2019s Guilty (\u201cA ranting Kavanaugh launched angry, evidence-free charges against Senate Democrats\u2026The method Republicans have used to defend Kavanaugh has consisted of suppressing most of the evidence that could be brought to bear in the hearing, and then complaining about the lack of evidence\u201d)\nChristine Blasey Ford\u2019s Sacrifice (\u201cHer testimony was heroic. Will it be pointless?\u201d)\nChristine Blasey Ford\u2019s Riveting, Persuasive Testimony (\u201cShe was afraid. She was strong. She was human.\u201d She was human in the best sense. Kavanaugh was human in the worst sense.)\nWhy Brett Kavanaugh Wasn\u2019t Believable (\u201cAnd why Christine Blasey Ford was.\u201d Blasey Ford was amazing \u2013 courageous, honest, \u201creal,\u201d and with no political motive to do this. Kavanaugh was out of control, nasty, abusive, insulting, disrespectful, entitled, not forthcoming and with a definite motive to do this.)\nThe Senate can\u2019t vote on Kavanaugh now (\u201cIf there is a rush to a confirmation vote, then senators must vote no on the Supreme Court nominee.\u201d)\nJust how low can Republican senators go? (\u201cIn its search for credibility, the Senate Judiciary Committee has lost a fair amount of its own.\u201d)\nThe Ford-Kavanaugh Hearings Will Be Remembered as a Grotesque Display of Patriarchal Resentment (Absolutely disgusting.)\nThe GOP hired a pro to question Ford. It did not go well. (\u201cRachel Mitchell did nothing to cast doubt on Ford\u2019s account of being sexual assaulted.\u201d)\nFord\u2019s testimony was devastating. Kavanaugh\u2019s was volcanic. (We\u2019re going to see how \u201ctribal\u201d Republicans are. Also how little they care about women.)\n\u201cIf They Can, They Will\u201d: The Ford-Kavanaugh Hearing and the Angry Politics of Now (\u201cThere are two Americas, growing more enraged by the minute, and they are not listening to each other.\u201d Yep, but they\u2019re not equivalent at all.)\nSenate Republicans Are More Emboldened Than Ever to Confirm Kavanaugh (\u201cThe mood in GOP circles was glum during Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony. But by Thursday\u2019s end, lawmakers were confident enough to quickly schedule a vote.\u201d Disgusting.)\nSomeone finally listened to Bill Cosby\u2019s victims. Now he\u2019s in jail. (\u201cSurvivors deserve our attention.\u201d)\nKavanaugh hearing puts America\u2019s state of disunion in stark relief (\u201cIn an era of bile and tribalisation, Christine Blasey Ford displayed the calm temperament of a judge while the supreme court nominee lashed out\u201d)\nWith his fiery testimony, Kavanaugh appears more Trump-like than ever (\u201cSupreme court nominee seemed to to be channeling the president when he came out swinging at an extraordinary hearing\u201d)\n\u2018Exactly Why I Nominated Him\u2019: Trump Gives Kavanaugh Positive Review After Hearing (Demented. Trump and Trumpism are bringing the United States of America down.)\nLatest In Washington\u2019s New Normal: High Court Nominees Stop Playing Nice (Kavanaugh was snarling, nasty, basically bonkers.)\nBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s best defense: Loud shouting and conspiracy theories (\u201cChristine Blasey Ford\u2019s dignity and honesty were a stark contrast to Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s bluster and accusation\u201d One thing\u2019s for sure is that Kavanaugh does NOT have the temperament to be a judge, let alone on the Supreme Court!)\nThis Was the Hour of White Male Rage (\u201cBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s hearing devolved into an exhibition of furious contempt for those who would keep him from what he\u2019s entitled.\u201d Hey bro, do you drink beers, hang out and talk about girls? Seriously, that\u2019s Brett Kavanaugh.)\nThe Republicans Abandoned Their Obligations to the Constitution and to the American People (\u201cThey sat silent as tombstones as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified about what she alleges Brett Kavanaugh did to her.\u201d)\nWhy did Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly refuse to call for an FBI investigation? (\u201cIs this what an innocent person would do?\u201d)\nGraham launches into angry, unhinged rant during Kavanaugh hearing (\u201cRepublican men are very angry.\u201d)\nGOP senators wanted a prosecutor to question Dr. Ford. They got a \u2018cruel\u2019 hearing. (\u201cThe format set up by Republicans made for an awkward and stilted inquisition.\u201d)\nDid Brett Kavanaugh collude with Ed Whelan on a conspiracy theory? Senators didn\u2019t ask. (\u201cIf the judge helped a reckless campaign to discredit his accuser, that would probably disqualify him from the Supreme Court. No one asked the question.\u201d)\nSEC sues Elon Musk for fraud and seeks to bar him from leading a company (\u201cMusk suggested in August that he was preparing to take Tesla private and claimed he had \u2018funding secured\u2019\u201d)\nTrump delays Rosenstein meeting, leaving future of Mueller boss uncertain (\u201cThe two will now meet next week in the wake of reports that Rosenstein discussed wiretapping the president.\u201d)\nVa.

Barbara Comstock (R-Va.).\u201d)\nTim Kaine is good for business)(\u201cFrom a business perspective, [Corey Stewart\u2019s] kinds of associations are not positives when Virginia is being evaluated by economic development prospects as a potential site for business expansion\u2026Tim Kaine has a long record of successful leadership. He has the right demeanor. A vote for Kaine is good for business and good for Virginia.\u201d)\nJim Webb: U.S. energy boom improves national security (It\u2019s really pathetic to see what Jim Webb has become.

Unfortunately, the way the United States Judiciary Committee has mishandled the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh bears a striking resemblance to how that same body mishandled claims against Clarence Thomas 27 years ago. Perhaps the two most striking differences were that this time the Majority decided to hire a female prosecutor to ask its questions and ultimately allowed the re-opening of an FBI investigation, the outcome of which was already a foregone conclusion. Apparently, the only thing the Senate learned from its mistakes in 1991 was to improve the optics of its actions, not the actions themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Failing to learn from its past mistakes, the Senate&mdash;with the slimmest majority of Senators&mdash;has decided for the second time in three decades to confirm a Justice accused of serial sexual misconduct to the Supreme Court.<\/p>\n<p>The question that has been rattling around in my head as this national travesty has unfolded is: What does this excruciating display teach our children, and how should we talk to them about it?<\/p>\n<p>I was five years old at the time of the Clarence Thomas hearings, and frankly, that was probably a good thing, because it did not make an impression on me. I grew up respecting women as equals, and it never once occurred to me that abusing someone could be considered acceptable to anyone, much less to our most senior elected representatives. But plenty of young people, both then and now, have observed how society reacts to those who bring forward sexual misconduct allegations against powerful figures. The public response only reinforces the indelible impression that the burden of proof of sexual misconduct still lies disproportionately with the accuser, and that sexual misconduct does not disqualify men from holding positions that demand our greatest public trust.<\/p>\n<p>As we interact with our children in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation, we must engage in frank conversations about the importance of respecting others. We must reaffirm that we value their perspectives and lived experiences, just as they should value those of others. We must ensure they know that we are there if they need someone in whom to confide, just as they should be there for others. And most important, we must continue encouraging them to do what the Senate failed to do&mdash;learn from past mistakes&mdash;so that the next generation does not have to face these same exhausting, emotional battles over and over again to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>The confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is profoundly disheartening. As I have agonized over the outcome, I&rsquo;m left with an enduring sense of hope&mdash;from seeing the reactions of young women and men everywhere&mdash;that the bravery and heroism displayed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (and Anita Hill before her) have not been in vain. By choosing to share her experience out of her own self-described civic duty, Dr. Ford has become an empowering figure and a role model for many Americans.

See below for comments by Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, Fairfax County School Board member Ryan McElveen, Virginia House Democratic Leader Del. David Toscano, Tom Perriello, Leslie Cockburn and others. The key lesson? Do NOT withdraw into anger and cynicism, but get MORE involved \u2013 as Del. Carroll Foy writes, \u201cTo everyone who feels anger, hopelessness and despair \u2013 to everyone who is fed up and fears for our future \u2013 we need you. Run for office. Volunteer on a campaign. Get involved.\u201d And, of course, VOTE!\nI ran for office because I know our country is better than this.\nTo everyone who feels anger, hopelessness and despair \u2013 to everyone who is fed up and fears for our future \u2013 we need you. Run for office. Volunteer on a campaign. Get involved. https://t.co/J1YBXbLsnR\n\u2014 Jennifer Carroll Foy (@JCarrollFoy) October 5, 2018\nFairfax County Public School Board member Ryan McElveen:\nIn America, we preach that mistakes are forgivable as long as we learn from them. Unfortunately, the way the United States Judiciary Committee has mishandled the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh bears a striking resemblance to how that same body mishandled claims against Clarence Thomas 27 years ago. Perhaps the two most striking differences were that this time the Majority decided to hire a female prosecutor to ask its questions and ultimately allowed the re-opening of an FBI investigation, the outcome of which was already a foregone conclusion. Apparently, the only thing the Senate learned from its mistakes in 1991 was to improve the optics of its actions, not the actions themselves.\nFailing to learn from its past mistakes, the Senate\u2014with the slimmest majority of Senators\u2014has decided for the second time in three decades to confirm a Justice accused of serial sexual misconduct to the Supreme Court.\nThe question that has been rattling around in my head as this national travesty has unfolded is: What does this excruciating display teach our children, and how should we talk to them about it?\nI was five years old at the time of the Clarence Thomas hearings, and frankly, that was probably a good thing, because it did not make an impression on me. I grew up respecting women as equals, and it never once occurred to me that abusing someone could be considered acceptable to anyone, much less to our most senior elected representatives. But plenty of young people, both then and now, have observed how society reacts to those who bring forward sexual misconduct allegations against powerful figures. The public response only reinforces the indelible impression that the burden of proof of sexual misconduct still lies disproportionately with the accuser, and that sexual misconduct does not disqualify men from holding positions that demand our greatest public trust.\nAs we interact with our children in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation, we must engage in frank conversations about the importance of respecting others. We must reaffirm that we value their perspectives and lived experiences, just as they should value those of others. We must ensure they know that we are there if they need someone in whom to confide, just as they should be there for others. And most important, we must continue encouraging them to do what the Senate failed to do\u2014learn from past mistakes\u2014so that the next generation does not have to face these same exhausting, emotional battles over and over again to no avail.\nThe confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is profoundly disheartening. As I have agonized over the outcome, I\u2019m left with an enduring sense of hope\u2014from seeing the reactions of young women and men everywhere\u2014that the bravery and heroism displayed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (and Anita Hill before her) have not been in vain. By choosing to share her experience out of her own self-described civic duty, Dr. Ford has become an empowering figure and a role model for many Americans. She is the living personification of doing what is right even if it means sacrificing everything. I believed her when she testified, and I still believe her today.\nDr. Ford\u2019s civic sacrifice for the country should inspire us to do all we can to elect leaders like the minority of Senators who have stood up on behalf of sexual misconduct survivors everywhere and prioritized the interests of people and country over party. The integrity of our public institutions needs protecting now more than ever, and in Democracies, that must start and end with us\u2014the voters.\nProtest of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation to Supreme Court at free speech mall with Indivisible Charlottesville and @tomperriello pic.twitter.com/IVXgYpuT7V\n\u2014 C-VILLE Weekly (@cvillenews_desk) October 5, 2018\n5th District Dem candidate @LeslieCockburn on scene at Downtown Mall where Kavanaugh protest is going on. pic.twitter.com/Jwa5InXiNp\n\u2014 C-VILLE Weekly (@cvillenews_desk) October 5, 2018\nNice to see @tomperriello @deltoscano and @LeslieCockburn come out to the #StopKavanaugh rally in downtown #Charlottesville Also fun to get shouty and march with a couple hundred equally angry folks. #NovemberIsComing pic.twitter.com/5EZove5M6E\n\u2014 CogitoErgoBibo (@CogitoErgoBibo) October 5, 2018\nAt the \u201cI Believe Her\u201d rally against confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, this evening on the Downtown Mall.

I not only have to live with these painful memories for the rest of my life, I\u2019ll have to live with the scars on my back as an every day reminder of what happens when we don\u2019t create proactive policies that protect and empower students\u2026I know there are students like me right now who are too afraid to come forward. It\u2019s the duty of this board, the duty of every single person in this room, to ensure that we create a more just future, one where survivors and victims of domestic violence don\u2019t have to live in silence.\nBoard Member Proposed Follow-On Motions:\nI move that the Board direct the superintendent to report to the board the details of required SRO training, including the required topics and frequency of the training.

The place was packed with over 300 fired-up Dems, including what felt like about 100 elected officials, candidates or possible candidates for various offices. If this is a sign of the (high) energy level among Virginia Dems right now, and I have little reason to doubt that it IS (based on everything I&rsquo;ve been seeing and hearing), 2019 could be a VERY good year for Virginia Dems.

The same is true in politics. In 2016, we had a choice after that election about how we would respond. In so many ways we felt that the lights had gone out in America. We felt a darkness had come over this country. A president, administration, people around him who took us to the lowest common denominators in our public life, who lied to us on a daily basis, who tear people down, who don&rsquo;t respect people based on who they are or who they love or where they come from, but instead exclude rather than include. And so that&rsquo;s what we were faced with here in the Commonwealth of Virginia as we stood in 2017 for the choice about whether or not we were going to be kind, whether or not we would be empathetic, or if we would stand up with one voice and say that w are taking this nation on a different, more positive course. And because of everything that you did, every door that you knocked, the faith that you had that we could be better country in spite of what had just happened. We did something that inspired this country. You elected a great governor, Dr. Ralph Northam, a great Attorney General, Mark Herring, and&hellip;15 new members of the House of Delegates&hellip;the most diverse caucus we have ever had&hellip;we celebrate the leadership of a dear friend Eileen Filler-Corn, who&rsquo;s going to lead our soon-to-be majority in the General Assembly in the House. And what an answer to what we saw to do something that historic at this moment, to put someone who has that kind of leadership. who will make that kind of difference. And so I hope that you all feel very proud about what you&rsquo;ve done, because I traveled all around America over the last year and a half, and I will tell you almost to a person as I&rsquo;ve campaigned with people and visited their states and seen what they are trying to do, they would come up to me and they would say &lsquo;thank you Virginia for giving us hope.'&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rJoDSz15RqI\"><\/iframe><\/figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_umqhEXMoQ\"><\/iframe><\/figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_S5eLhBq1U\"><\/iframe><\/figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J37cjieCPDg\"><\/iframe><\/figure>","text":"Every year, the Fairfax County Democratic Committee holds its \u201cRoad to Richmond\u201d even, a few days before the start of the new Virginia General Assembly session.

The city, county and/or state you save might very well be your own!\nWith that, see below for some photos and video (I\u2019ll add more later as I see them) from the event.\n(the following photo courtesy of Charisse Espy Glassman)\nGreat riff, by the way, by LG Justin Fairfax:\nThey say that life is 10% what happens to you at 90% how do you respond. The same is true in politics. In 2016, we had a choice after that election about how we would respond. In so many ways we felt that the lights had gone out in America. We felt a darkness had come over this country. A president, administration, people around him who took us to the lowest common denominators in our public life, who lied to us on a daily basis, who tear people down, who don\u2019t respect people based on who they are or who they love or where they come from, but instead exclude rather than include. And so that\u2019s what we were faced with here in the Commonwealth of Virginia as we stood in 2017 for the choice about whether or not we were going to be kind, whether or not we would be empathetic, or if we would stand up with one voice and say that w are taking this nation on a different, more positive course. And because of everything that you did, every door that you knocked, the faith that you had that we could be better country in spite of what had just happened. We did something that inspired this country. You elected a great governor, Dr. Ralph Northam, a great Attorney General, Mark Herring, and\u202615 new members of the House of Delegates\u2026the most diverse caucus we have ever had\u2026we celebrate the leadership of a dear friend Eileen Filler-Corn, who\u2019s going to lead our soon-to-be majority in the General Assembly in the House. And what an answer to what we saw to do something that historic at this moment, to put someone who has that kind of leadership. who will make that kind of difference. And so I hope that you all feel very proud about what you\u2019ve done, because I traveled all around America over the last year and a half, and I will tell you almost to a person as I\u2019ve campaigned with people and visited their states and seen what they are trying to do, they would come up to me and they would say \u2018thank you Virginia for giving us hope.'\u201d","authors":[{"name":"lowkell","link":"http://bluevirginia.us/author/lowkell"}],"docId":99238992328,"fromSeedUrl":"https://bluevirginia.us/","seedUrlHash32":3208478875,"parentUrlDocId":68139227599,"gburl":"http://bluevirginia.us/2019/01/packed-house-300-of-fire-up-dems-for-road-to-richmond-event-in-fairfax-diffbotxyz2006419678","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1547079991,"timestamp":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:26:31 GMT"}

This year&rsquo;s event was from 11 am to 1 pm today in Vienna, just outside of Tysons (not &ldquo;Tysons Corner&rdquo; anymore, I guess). The place was packed with over 300 fired-up Dems, including what felt like about 100 elected officials, candidates or possible candidates for various offices. If this is a sign of the (high) energy level among Virginia Dems right now, and I have little reason to doubt that it IS (based on everything I&rsquo;ve been seeing and hearing), 2019 could be a VERY good year for Virginia Dems.

Research bears this out.\u201d)\nTalking About Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Likability is a Way to Tell Women to Sit Down and Shut Up (\u201cWomen are expected to be effortless, so the fact that Warren and Clinton\u2014who have little else in common\u2014are so evidently hard-working is considered damning instead of an asset.\u201d)\nBeto O\u2019Rourke Says He\u2019s \u201cSupportive of the Concept\u201d of a Green New Deal (\u201cThe former congressman is the latest potential 2020 contender to flirt with the sweeping climate policy.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt we need *something* like a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d the only questions are the details and political realities.)\nSean Hannity warns that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will stop rich people from buying boats and \u201ctaking expensive vacations\u201d (Untrue of course. What Ocasio-Cortez was talking about was something like the tax code we had for much of the 20th century in this country, where the super-rich theoretically paid a very high marginal tax rate above certain very high \u2013 millions \u2013 income levels.)\nClinton buddy McAuliffe: 50% chance I\u2019ll challenge Trump in 2020 (\u201cHe also discussed his claim that Democratic presidential candidates should avoid \u2018dishonest populism,\u2019 asserting he was not referring to Warren, when pressed by Melber, who noted she was currently the only candidate in the race.\u201d)\nTerry McAuliffe Is Right (If the conservative National Review says you\u2019re \u201cright,\u201d you\u2019re almost certainly wrong.)\nTrump denies that Jim Webb is under consideration for Defense secretary (Trump, in his usual style: \u201cThe story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I\u2019m sure he is a fine man, but I don\u2019t know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!\u201d)\nDem rep asks for asks for pay to be withheld during shutdown (\u201cFreshman Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) sent a letter Thursday to the House chief administrative officer asking for her pay to be withheld as a partial government shutdown drags on into a third week.\u201d)\nVirginia NAACP Files Powerful Comments on Dominion\u2019s Proposed Union Hill Compressor Station (\u201cThis \u2018appears to be a deliberate effort by the applicant, Dominion Energy, to erase the historic African American community of Union Hill from the record'\u201d)\nVa. House Republicans buck Northam with plan to maximize Trump tax savings (Do Republicans EVER want to invest in education, the environment and other important priorities? Of course not \u2013 they just want to give people, particularly those who don\u2019t need the money, tax cuts \u2013 Republicans\u2019 answer to everything including the common cold.)\nVirginia Republicans say taxpayers would save $440 million under their plan (We have pressing needs for that $440 million, including schools, environmental protection, and transit)\nSchapiro: Ahead of legislative session, both parties squeezed by the base (Behind the RTD\u2019s firewall, but just based on the title \u2013 \u201cboth parties,\u201d ugh \u2013 I have a feeling I\u2019m not going to like this one.)\nUSPS IG clears conservative group of wrongdoing in Spanberger file release (\u201cAt least 6 other former employees had their files improperly released after FOIA requests, IG found\u201d)\nThe FBI must wake from its deep slumber on the death of Bijan Ghaisar (Absolutely, this was totally outrage.)\nBob Marshall column: Don\u2019t waste time trying to resurrect the Equal Rights Amendment (Can someone please explain why newspapers feel the need to constantly give space to an extremist, bigot and all-around nutjob like \u201cSideshow Bob\u201d Marshall? I\u2019m losing track of how many variants of this assinine op-ed we\u2019ve been subjected to in recent weeks.)\n\u201cDisrespectful\u201d: Hampton Roads anglers are hoping Virginia puts a stop to roping fish (\u201cCulling, called roping in saltwater circles, can bloat the striper\u2019s stomach to make it heavier, but also tear apart its jaw and potentially drown it.\u201d Barbaric.)","authors":[{"name":"lowkell","link":"https://bluevirginia.us/author/lowkell"}],"docId":11866675705,"fromSeedUrl":"https://bluevirginia.us/","seedUrlHash32":3208478875,"parentUrlDocId":135319656956,"gburl":"https://bluevirginia.us/2019/01/saturday-news-trump-threatens-years-long-shutdown-for-border-wall-a-freshman-a-viral-video-and-a-profanity-revive-trump-impeachment-talk-tmac-says-50-50-shot-hell-run-for-president-trum-diffbotxyz527753909","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1547078843,"timestamp":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:07:23 GMT"}

This year&rsquo;s event was from 11 am to 1 pm today in Vienna, just outside of Tysons (not &ldquo;Tysons Corner&rdquo; anymore, I guess). The place was packed with over 300 fired-up Dems, including what felt like about 100 elected officials, candidates or possible candidates for various offices. If this is a sign of the (high) energy level among Virginia Dems right now, and I have little reason to doubt that it IS (based on everything I&rsquo;ve been seeing and hearing), 2019 could be a VERY good year for Virginia Dems. But standard disclaimer: let&rsquo;s not get overconfident, rest on our laurels or take anything to granted, of course, but work our butts off and make sure we: a) take back the Virginia General Assembly; b) win as many local offices as we possibly can this coming November.<\/p>\n<p>Among others that I had a chance to talk to today were: LG Justin Fairfax and both his senior advisor Larry Roberts and his communications director Lauren Victoria Burke; Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw (that was interesting&hellip;heh); House Democratic Leader Eileen Filler-Corn; Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney (VERY interesting that he drove up to Fairfax County for this event &ndash; possible indication that he&rsquo;s thinking about running statewide in 2021?

We felt a darkness had come over this country. A president, administration, people around him who took us to the lowest common denominators in our public life, who lied to us on a daily basis, who tear people down, who don&rsquo;t respect people based on who they are or who they love or where they come from, but instead exclude rather than include. And so that&rsquo;s what we were faced with here in the Commonwealth of Virginia as we stood in 2017 for the choice about whether or not we were going to be kind, whether or not we would be empathetic, or if we would stand up with one voice and say that w are taking this nation on a different, more positive course.
