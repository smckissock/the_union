    "“You’re going to learn about signature verification, we’re going to go over the results that took place in the 2020 election in Maricopa with, how they verified signatures, what results they had, then we’re going to share with you two important experiments that we did, where we got novices, to do the same exercise of having side by side signatures, and then telling us whether the signatures matched or not from the same person,” the researcher said, adding that the purpose of the study was to “educate” election officials both in Arizona and around the country.",
    "“Over 200,000, mail ballots, with mismatched signatures counted without being reviewed, which means cured, and you’re going to understand what that terminology means in Maricopa, and this is a first study, to the best of our knowledge, to calculate signature matching rates, to provide a quantitative framework for assessing signature verification of mail ballots, the whole area of mail-in ballots obviously has become a very controversial area, it’s split up the country, there’s a lot of division,” he continued.",

    "That resulted in hundreds of thousands fewer ballots being sent for further review than should have been, and as the research demonstrates, there were plenty of very obviously mismatched signatures — way more than enough to overturn Arizona’s ‘election of Joe Biden’ for president.",
    "In Arizona there were AT LEAST 229,430 early ballots with CLEARLY mismatched signatures\nIn an election decided by 10,457 votes pic.twitter.com/B40IirnWVJ\n— Liz Harrington (@realLizUSA) February 23, 2022\nShe followed that tweet up with screenshots of the examples Ayyadurai found.",
    "The study, by Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai of MIT, found more than 200,000 ballots from the election contained “mismatched signatures” and they were all counted in Maricopa County without being “cured” — that is, reviewed for accuracy and summarily fixed or rejected, as the law requires.",
    "Ayyadurai explained that ballot curing is done by election workers who don’t have a lot of training and do not spend more than a few seconds attempting to match signatures, which is a problem in a large area when millions of ballot signatures have to be matched.",
    "(Natural News) A newly published study reveals additional evidence that the 2020 presidential election in Arizona was stolen from President Donald Trump just like he and his campaign surrogates and attorneys have insisted now for more than a year.",
    "In the case of Arizona, as Harrington pointed out, some 12 percent of early mail-in ballots contained mismatched signatures, but in Maricopa County, the state’s largest population center, just 1.3 percent of ballots were sent to be cured.",
    "In Arizona there were AT LEAST 229,430 early ballots with CLEARLY mismatched signatures In an election decided by 10,457 votes,” she wrote in a tweet that contained a short video of Ayyadurai explaining his findings.",
    "He also said that the results were being provided to the Arizona Senate as well as GOP Attorney General Mark Brnovich.",
    "Liz Harrington, who handles communications for the former president, tweeted the results of the study.",
    "Trump is right, again: What happened in 2020 was flat-out election theft.",
    "Maricopa County only sent 1.3% for curing.",
