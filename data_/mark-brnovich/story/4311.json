    "Anyone who helps an illegal alien avoid capture or deportation, knowing that the individual is, indeed, an illegal alien, commits a major federal felony if he:\nbrings to or attempts to bring to the United States in any manner whatsoever such person at a place other than a designated port of entry or place other than as designated by the Commissioner, regardless of whether such alien has received prior official authorization to come to, enter, or reside in the United States and regardless of any future official action which may be taken with respect to such alien; …\ntransports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise, in furtherance of such violation of law; …\nconceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation; …\nencourages or induces an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law.",
    "As bad as all that is, according to government documents divulged last year by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Biden and Mayorkas plan not to deport more than 8,000 hardened illegal-alien criminals, including these:\n• 19 convicted of homicide\n• 27 convicted of sexual offenses\n• 9 convicted of sexual assault\n• 375 convicted of assault\n• 17 convicted of burglary\n• 9 convicted of commercialized sexual offenses\n• 4 convicted of kidnapping\n• 7 convicted of obscenity\n• 13 convicted of robbery\n• 19 convicted of stealing a vehicle\n• 91 convicted of larceny\nThough outright murderers, rapists, terrorists, and gang members might get the boot (if ICE can find them), criminals in the following categories wouldn’t.",
    "Claiming that immigration authorities will exercise “discretion” in deciding whom to send back home, Mayorkas wrote that “the majority of undocumented noncitizens who could be subject to removal have been contributing members of our communities for years.”\nAnd if it weren’t for them, well, society could collapse:\nThey include individuals who work on the frontlines in the battle against COVID, lead our congregations of faith, teach our children, do back-breaking farm work to help deliver food to our table, and contribute in many other meaningful ways.",
    "“If there is any question as to whether an individual falls into the category of posing a public safety threat, managers should err on the side of caution and postpone the individual’s removal until a full assessment, in coordination with local Office of Chief Counsel, is conducted.” The memo went on:\nIf there isn’t sufficient time to determine whether an individual was convicted of an aggravated felony or poses a public safety risk, the individual shall be removed from the manifest until such time as the review is completed.",
    "“Under section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), DHS has two options when it encounters aliens at the border who either entered illegally or sought admission at the ports without proper documents,” Arthur explained:\nFirst, section 235(b)(1) of the INA enables DHS to process those illegal migrants for “expedited removal,” under which they can be removed without appearing before an immigration judge, unless the alien claims a fear of harm upon return or requests asylum.",
    "“Unlawful presence in the United States will alone not be a basis for an immigration enforcement action but rather, we will allocate our efforts, we will allocate our resources on those individuals who pre-sent a current public safety threat, a threat to national security, or a threat to our border security, and that is a very important principle,” he said, continuing:\nAnd we also want, with you, to champion our identity as a country.",
    "Oddly, Mayorkas’s memorandum contains this note on illegals and whether they are a “threat to border security” and “priority for apprehension and removal”:\nA noncitizen is a threat to border security if:\n(a) they are apprehended at the border or port of entry while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States; or\n(b) they are apprehended in the United States after unlawfully entering after November 1, 2020.",

    "Gone will be the protections of the Bill of Rights, as leftists move to outlaw guns, “hate speech,” voter ID to ensure honest elections, and anything else they view as a threat or even impediment to the permanent imposition of totalitarian measures that will keep middle-class Americans under permanent control and financially supporting the underclass the Democrats have imported.",
    "The cartels have taken control of our border, and we’re negotiating with the hostage-takers.”\nAfter the “migrants” are apprehended, they head to “consolidation centers” where “they are given folders color-coded to the city of their destination,” Wong continued:\nI saw folders with tickets to Houston, Atlanta, Newark and JFK.",
    "Mark Morgan, head of CBP under President Trump, told the New York Post’s Angie Wong that U.S. officials “now coordinate with the cartels and coyotes on where and when drop-offs will happen.”\n“Morgan told me they wanted to avoid scenes like the ones of children being dropped over walls in remote areas,” Wong reported.",

    "But the most important takeaway from the Biden-Mayorkas immigration “failure” is that it does not prove that the pair is “incompetent,” or that they “don’t know what they’re doing.” Indeed, from their perspective, what’s happening at the border, and to internal immigration enforcement, isn’t a failure at all.",
    "“Justice” actually requires deporting illegals, but in any event Mayorkas then declared that even naturalization fraud would not bar an illegal from citizenship, which was something of an irony given that Mayorkas was caught finagling visas for wealthy foreigners when he worked for President Barack Obama.",
    "Regardless of whether those migrants are processed under section 235(b)(1) of the INA for expedited removal or section 235(b)(2) of the INA for regular removal, however, they are supposed to be detained throughout the entire process — from apprehension to removal or admission.",
