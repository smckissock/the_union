S. Constitution, & AZ has the power to defend itself.",
    "Republican Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich issued an opinion Monday calling the crisis at the border an “invasion,” claiming that by declaring it as such the state is allowed to take more action to defend itself against the “invasion.”\n“The federal government’s failure to secure the border and protect Arizona from invasion is dangerous and unprecedented,” Brnovich said in a statement.",
