    "Because of this non-compliance, which the Senate’s auditors also experienced, the AG’s “investigation is still developing in material ways.”\nMaricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates and Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer responded in a joint statement Wednesday, saying, “The Attorney General’s interim report about the 2020 election in Maricopa County includes no new evidence, nothing that would have changed the results and nothing that should lead people to question the overall health of our electoral system.”\n“The bottom line: the AG has not identified even a single instance where a ballot was accepted with a non-matching signature (or signature that was later cured),” they added.",

    "“At times workers conducting the verification process had only seconds to review a signature.”\n“For example on November 4, 2020, the Maricopa County Recorder verified 206,648 early ballot affidavit signatures, which resulted in an average of 4.6 seconds per signature,” Brnovich continued.",
    "And I made sure that there was more access for more voters, ever.”\n“They just don’t like the fact that one guy lost.”\nBREAKING NEWS: Arizona Audit w/ @KelliWardAZ\nAG @GeneralBrnovich has determined widespread FRAUD in the Maricopa County 2020 election.",
