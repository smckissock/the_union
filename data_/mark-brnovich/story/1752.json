    "When asked why the public health protection is being lifted when the U.S. is still in a declared public health emergency, Judd said: 'Normally somebody would say it's confusing, but when you look at this administration, if you look at how it plays politics, it becomes crystal clear why they are doing it: Since inauguration this administration has pandered to far-left activists.",
    "But immigration experts told DailyMail.com that although Title 42 has left thousands of refugees in danger in Mexico, there is no plan for an effective and fair replacement system – meaning a pileup of tens of thousands of desperate asylum seekers at ports of entry is likely in border cities like Tijuana, south of California and Reynosa, across the border from Hidalgo, Texas.",

    "Advertisement\nIn a statement on April 1, Abbott called ending Title 42 'reckless' and said Biden's 'open-border policies' have caused the state to take drastic measures like sending out Department of Public Safety troopers and more than 10,000 Texas National Guard members to arrest migrants at the border.",
    "Abbott said the plan was to drop migrants off at the steps of the US Capitol building itself, and added: 'The Biden administration, they’ve been dumping large numbers of migrants, on cities up and down the border, leaving cities to grapple with challenges they don’t have the capability of dealing with.",
    "'Just because the state says that it is an invasion that doesn't necessarily make it so, it is not clear to me what additional legal authority that conveys on them,' Berman said, adding that state officials can enforce state laws, but the line is drawn at what the federal law allows.",

    "While speaking Tuesday to a conservative talk radio station, Abbott's remarks about constitutional authority were in relation to Congress, which he said had the only power to reduce the flow of migrants.",
    "Greg Abbott says he will be be bussing thousands of illegal migrants who cross the border straight to Washington DC and leaving them on the steps of the US Capitol for President Biden to deal with.",
    "The policy allows border patrol agents to deny entry to migrants without considering their asylum claims if they have been in a country where a communicable disease – such as COVID – is rife.",

    "He said he has not spoken with Abbott claiming the governor's current sweeping border mission, known as Operation Lone Star, has put little dent in the number of people crossing the border.",
    "Judd said another reason CBP is overwhelmed is because many have quit or were fired due to their refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine when Biden made it a requirement for federal employees.",

    "U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose district includes the Texas border, has criticized the Biden administration over border security and ending Title 42.",

    "He explained: 'We have more people potentially crossing our border by the end of this year than live in Los Angeles, America’s second-largest city.'",
    "'The border region is going to be lit at night in prominent smuggling areas to make it easier to detect any illegal activity that is taking place.",

    "On Wednesday, Abbott also announced enhanced checks on all cars crossing the southern border into Texas, to try and cut down on cartel smuggling.",
    "He said that boats blockades, shipping container blockades and razor wire would be erected at high-traffic areas and low water crossings.",
    "So I said, \"I've got a better idea, instead of bussing these people to San Antonio, lets continue the ride all the way to Washington DC.\"",

    "'Migrants are being given the choice, it's their choice – it's their choice, they can refuse to be vaccinated,' Judd explained.",
    "'Congress has to stop talking about it, has to stop complaining about it, has to stop going to the border and looking at it.",
    "'And that, of course, makes us feel unwanted, it makes us feel unproductive, it demoralizes all of the agents,' Judd said.",
    "'Now they're talking about getting rid of the only deterrent that they left in place, which was Title 42,' Judd lamented.",
