    "First are the Senate numbers, with the firm's January numbers in parenthesis; note that the earlier numbers used a registered voter model, while this survey samples likely voters:\nAttorney General Mark Brnovich: 21 (25)\nbusinessman Jim Lamon: 16 (7)\nformer Thiel Capital chief operating officer Blake Masters: 9 (6)\nretired Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire: 6 (11)\nCorporation Commissioner Justin Olson: 3 (4)\nLamon's team has also released a new internal from Remington Research Group that argues he's actually in the lead with 32%, while Brnovich is in second with 20%.",
    "GA-Gov, GA-Sen, GA-SoS: The University of Georgia attempts to measure Donald Trump's influence in the May 24 Republican primary with a poll that includes two different randomly assigned groups: A sample where respondents are simply asked who they'll vote for, and a separate group where participants are informed which candidate Trump has endorsed and then asked who they'll support.",
    "Meanwhile, election officials told the Pennsylvania Capital-Star that it would have been too late to fulfill GOP state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman's aborted request to remove his name from the ballot on Tuesday even if he hadn't abruptly reversed course hours after his initial filing and announced he was staying in following Trump's intervention to oppose McSwain.",
    "Ortagus, who is Trump's pick, doesn't have a clear shot to the ballot, though, because the Tennessee Republican Party's executive committee removed her and two other notable candidates last week for not meeting the party's definition of a \"bona fide\" Republican; the rejected candidates will have their chance to appeal before the primary lineup is finalized on April 21.\n?",
    "Cortez Masto is one of several vulnerable senators who began advertising weeks ago, but she has an especially good reason to get on the air early: The New York Times, citing data from the Democratic firm TargetSmart, recently wrote, \"Almost half the voters on Nevada's rolls have registered since Ms. Cortez Masto was last on the ballot in 2016.\"",
    "A key reason that even Republican legislators have resisted DeSantis' efforts to demolish the 5th is because a set of amendments reforming the redistricting process that voters added to the state constitution in 2010 (often known as the \"Fair Districts\" amendments) prohibit, among other things, the \"retrogression\" of minority voting rights.",
    "The board's two independent members, who both opposed the map while all three Republicans voted in favor, argued that the pairing of House districts (two make up each Senate seat) continues to improperly favor the GOP, with one warning that \"it's very audacious for us to actually think that\" the courts aren't \"going to sniff this out.\"",
    "While the Supreme Court is now packed with conservatives, it unanimously rejected a request from DeSantis earlier this year to pre-emptively approve his vision for the 5th District on procedural grounds, so the governor may not receive the welcome he's hoping for when the inevitable legal challenge makes its way before the justices.",
    "NV-Gov: Better Nevada PAC, which is supporting Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo in the GOP primary, is running an ad attacking North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee over his lengthy past as a Democrat before he switched parties to run this cycle, claiming he \"tried to raise the fuel tax\" and tying him to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.",
    "With Republican lawmakers going supine and likely to succumb to DeSantis' whims—he's pushed for a maximalist gerrymander both to prove his partisan bona fides and because feuding with the legislature is an easy way to inflame his base—the major question will be how the state courts react to this radical reshaping of Florida's map.",
    "The centerpiece of DeSantis' new proposal, which for months he'd pushed in the face—until now—of strenuous opposition by state lawmakers, is the dismantling of the 5th District, a plurality-Black seat represented by Democratic Rep. Al Lawson that stretches across the northern tier of the state from Jacksonville to Tallahassee.",
    "Candidate filing closed back in March, and the only Democrat who remains on the ballot is Gary Josephson, whom Cleveland.com's Jeremy Pelzer says unsuccessfully ran for state party chair with a platform that called for recruiting Dave Chappelle to run for the Senate and for Democrats to support two Republican incumbents, Gov.",
    "Lewis had the support of House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who represents the 29% of the new 4th District that is currently located in Hoyer's old 5th District, but he struggled to gain traction in a field that includes former Rep. Donna Edwards, former Prince George's County State's Attorney Glenn Ivey, and former Del.",
    "Next up are OH's gubernatorial numbers, which also find a big shift from January for second place even as the overall leader remains the same:\nformer TV anchor Kari Lake: 29 (21)\nBoard of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson: 22 (6)\nformer Rep. Matt Salmon: 11 (17)\n2018 secretary of state nominee Steve Gaynor: 3 (5)\n?",
    "While the Supreme Court has become much more conservative since then following DeSantis' appointments, Warren points out that \"the anti-retrogression mandate is a clear and uncontroversial part\" of state law, adding, \"There's consensus on what it means, and the practical effect for Black voters\" in northern Florida.",
    "However, in a sign of his lack of seriousness, he touted a poll from the notoriously erratic John McLaughlin—a pollster we've flat-out banned from Daily Kos Elections for spewing conspiracy theories about the 2020 elections—to argue he would be competitive against Trone in this recently redrawn 54-44 Biden district.",
    "CA-15: Assemblyman Kevin Mullin has publicized an internal poll from FM3 that gives him a 31-17 lead over San Mateo County Supervisor David Canepa, a fellow Democrat, in the June top-two primary: Republican Gus Mattamal and a third Democrat, Burlingame Councilmember Emily Beach, are at 9% and 8%, respectively.",
    "AK Redistricting: Alaska's redistricting board approved a revised state Senate map in a 3-2 vote on Wednesday after the state Supreme Court struck down the panel's original map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander last month, though the latest boundaries will face further judicial scrutiny.",
    "Bill Lee allowed a bill to become law without his signature on Wednesday that would impose a requirement that House candidates have voted in the previous three statewide general elections to be eligible to run, it won't go into effect this cycle because candidate filing already closed last week.",
    "Rep. Neal Dunn should, however, have no problem holding the former given the looming midterm environment, while Rep. Scott Franklin could instead run in the 18th, a 61-38 Trump district smack in the center of the state that we're regarding as the \"new\" district Florida won in reapportionment.",
    "TN Redistricting: The Tennessee Supreme Court overturned a recent lower court ruling that blocked the state's new map for the state Senate from taking effect this year, holding that the decision would harm election officials by requiring that the candidate filing deadline be extended.",
    "Republicans, though, will only be doing this in seven seats, including the competitive 2nd and 7th Districts: They'll instead be employing a convention in the 5th District, where freshman Rep. Bob Good has no serious intra-party opposition, and the safely blue 8th and 11th Districts.",
    "Ron DeSantis released his proposed new map for Florida's congressional districts on Thursday, following an extraordinary announcement by GOP legislative leaders on Monday that they would abdicate their authority to draw new boundaries and instead bequeath that power to the governor.",
    "According to Dave's Redistricting App, the plan would establish 20 districts that Donald Trump would have won versus just eight that Joe Biden would have carried, compared to a 15-12 Trump advantage under the current map (Florida is gaining a district thanks to reapportionment).",
    "That district was created following a 2014 lawsuit that successfully challenged the congressional map Republicans passed in 2012 under the Fair Districts amendments, based on an agreement between lawmakers and plaintiffs that was ultimately blessed by the state Supreme Court.",
    "Elsewhere, the map would make further changes to boost the GOP's fortunes, chiefly in the middle part of the state:\nIn the Orlando area, DeSantis would pack Democratic voters into the 10th District to make it even more safely blue in order to turn the neighboring 7th red.",
    "The court ruled that the latest maps, which were barely changed from the previous set, continued to violate the state constitution's requirement that they reflect the two parties' statewide voting shares over the past decade and instead unduly favored Republicans.",
    "The new map breaks Jacksonville apart to create a revamped district that would almost certainly elect a white Republican instead of a Black Democrat like Lawson: The 5th would transform from a district Biden won 63-36 into a 57-41 Trump seat—a swing of 43 points.",
    "VA-05: Former Henry County Supervisor Andy Parker failed to make the Democratic primary ballot because of what party officials say was a lack of valid signatures, though Parker said he'd take \"a few days to perform a forensic audit on our petition signatures.",
    "State-run primaries, by contrast, take place on Tuesdays with far more polling sites and also have significantly longer polling hours and early voting periods and locations; the rules are different as well, because candidates only need to win a plurality.",
    "The spot highlights her roots of growing up on a Montana ranch and her record of standing up to powerful corporations; the commercial hits very similar themes to the debut ad that public health expert Cora Neumann went on the air with earlier in the week.",
    "Along central Florida's Gulf coast, DeSantis would revive an egregious gerrymander that was struck down by the courts by having the Tampa-based 14th District cross Tampa Bay to pack Black voters in eastern St. Petersburg into this solidly blue district.",
    "TX-34 (special): Candidate filing closed Wednesday for the June 14 all-party primary to succeed Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who resigned early to take a job at the lobbying and law giant Akin Gump, and two Democrats and two Republicans are competing.",
    "Following the publication of the Examiner's article, every woman serving along with Slama in the Nebraska Senate signed on to a joint bipartisan statement declaring, \"Herbster's actions as outlined by the Nebraska Examiner render him unfit to serve.\"",
    "Six other women also, in Sanderford's words, said \"that Herbster touched them inappropriately when they were saying hello or goodbye to him, or when they were posing for a photograph by his side\" in incidents that occured between 2017 and this year.",
    "OH-13: Attorney Shay Hawkins is running a 15-second TV ad ahead of the May 3 GOP primary that plays up his bona fides as an \"America First Conservative,\" claiming he worked to pass Trump's tax cuts and will fight for \"stronger borders\" if elected.",
    "Kevin Stitt earned a not-tweet endorsement from Donald Trump last month back before the June primary was anywhere as close to as expensive as it is now, and Trump will be giving the incumbent a larger boost by headlining a fundraiser for him.",
    "Finally, Team Red will hold a party-run \"firehouse primary\" to choose its nominee against Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton in the 10th, a Northern Virginia seat Biden would have won 58-40 but where Republicans are hoping to regain lost ground.",

    "Biden carried the current version of this Rio Grande Valley constituency 52-48 while he would have taken the new one 57-42, but Republicans are hoping that a Flores win in the special will give her a better chance for an upset in November.",

    "They did, however, strongly encourage the board to complete a map created by a pair of independent experts that the panel abandoned at the last minute, saying that the plan was \"on track to being constitutionally compliant.\"",
    "By contrast, Lee is airing his own attack ad that argues it's Lombardo who is the true \"RINO,\" cramming in several typical GOP buzzwords and tropes on topics such as guns and immigration to argue he's the true conservative.",
    "Cuellar, just like in 2020, uses the type of language you'd normally expect to find in a Republican commercial, with a narrator arguing that Cisneros' agenda would result in \"open borders that would make us less safe.\"",
