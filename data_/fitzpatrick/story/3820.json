    "Historian David Dufty with his new non-fiction book Nabbing Ned Kelly.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen\nMr Patton praises the book on its back cover: “A must-read book that unmasks the Kelly myth and shines new light on the police efforts to bring them to justice.”\nThe book’s author, Canberra historian David Dufty, says he has no police links.",
    "Mr Hogan said these authors looked at primary documents such as in public record offices and parliamentary papers, “and have carefully gone through what available evidence there is, rather than relying on what some author said in a book 20 years ago, who was repeating what another author said 20 years before that”.",
    "Tim Hogan, the State Library of Victoria’s principal librarian of Victorian and Australian collections, said Nabbing Ned Kelly was one of a string of books released in the past 12 years which had “deconstructed the romantic, soft image of Ned Kelly” and challenged beliefs.",
    "“We continue to honour the loss of these officers, and it’s important that their story is told.”\nThe statement said the Chief Commissioner “does not routinely provide book reviews, however, given the significant subject of this book, chose to do so on this occasion”.",
    "The statement said, in part, that the Stringybark Creek murders of three Victoria Police officers, who had entered the Wombat Ranges with warrants to arrest the Kelly gang, marked a defining moment in the history of the organisation.",

    "Seven police at the siege of Glenrowan on the morning of June 28, 1880.Credit:Victoria Police Museum\nDr Dufty said Ward’s superiors may have wanted the credit for nabbing Kelly – and the reward money – for themselves.",
    "The book said Detective Ward’s efforts, which included surveillance, helped starve the fugitive Kelly gang of supplies and friends, which helped drive them to the “desperate” Glenrowan siege that was their downfall.",
    "Dr Dufty says that a witness, Kelly associate “Brickey” Williamson, agreed with Fitzpatrick that the assault didn’t happen and that even Kelly told a policeman after his arrest in Glenrowan that it wasn’t true.",
    "That tradition is still there, but it’s really been challenged in recent years.”\nThe Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.",
    "It argues that James Wallace, a King Valley school teacher, post master and friend of Kelly Gang member Joe Byrne, probably wrote the famous Jerilderie Letter in which Kelly airs his grievances.",
    "Dr Dufty found no proof, as Kelly claimed, that the Stringybark Creek murders of three policemen were committed in self-defence, nor does Dr Dufty believe that police set out to kill the gang.",
    "But Dr Dufty found many examples of the police force’s incompetence, laziness and petty politics, for example, the senior police who banned Detective Ward from going to the Glenrowan siege.",
    "He found that bushranger Kelly was “no hero” – as he is regarded by some – and instead a manipulative, violent criminal; a murderer and an organised crime boss who stole horses.",
    "“Certainly the view of Kelly as ‘violent criminal cop killer’ is taking a lot more hold now as a result of these sorts of books and writings that are out there,” Mr Hogan said.",
    "Share\nNormal text sizeLarger text sizeVery large text size\nIn the 142 years since bushranger Ned Kelly was executed, a never-ending stream of books have been written about him.",
    "“Despite the passage of over 140 years, the same risks inherent in performing their job are still familiar to our members today,” the spokesperson said.",
    "Dr Dufty said he had no pre-conceptions but went to primary sources such as the Royal Commission into the Kelly outbreak, police records and memoirs.",
    "They include Ian MacFarlane’s The Kelly Gang Unmasked and Stuart Dawson’s Ned Kelly and the Myth of a Republic of North-Eastern Victoria.",
    "He said that in Ward’s two years on the case, he cultivated informers, gathered intelligence and even went undercover as a swagman.",
    "Chief Commissioner Shane Patton calls Nabbing Ned Kelly – which tells of police efforts to catch the Kelly gang – “a must read”.",
    "The book claims that Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick did not molest Ned’s sister Kate at the Kelly house in Greta in April 1878.",
    "He set out to explore what he saw as an under-studied angle: the police role – as opposed to Ned’s side – of the Kelly saga.",
    "Mr Hogan said errors and “romantic notions” started to seep in to public discourse if no one checked the original documents.",
    "“There’s still some people writing books that are probably a little bit more generous or forgiving of Kelly’s activities.",

    "Mr Patton declined an interview request by The Age and Sydney Morning Herald about his praise of the book.",
    "Dr Dufty believes the allegation originated in a “trashy” article in a Melbourne newspaper.",
