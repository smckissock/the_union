    "“Which is a little bit odd, because we do have a lot of industrial projects that have been proposed for the area.”\nDr Fitzpatrick said the gulf and nearby Ningaloo were one of the last places in the Pilbara relatively untouched by major industrial projects but there had been a push and pull between industrialisation and environmentalism which had come to a head in the past few years.",
    "Czeblukov’s true sea snake has been found in Exmouth Gulf, near the Bay of Rest.Credit:Andrew Davenport/Ben Fitzpatrick\nIn 2018 marine scientist Andrew Davenport was on a paddleboard when he came across the body of a Czeblukov’s true sea snake north of the mangrove-filled Bay of Rest.",
    "He said with the recent cumulative impact study by the Environmental Protection Authority WA and the announcement the state government would protect large swathes of the gulf were positive steps which meant some knowledge gaps would have to be addressed in the planning process.",
    "“That’s one of the key features of WA and sea snakes, we keep finding rare and also threatened species in places we didn’t know they existed.”\nShort-nosed sea snakes were formerly thought extinct before this shot of them courting at Ningaloo confirmed their continued existence.",
    "Oceanwise Australia director Ben Fitzpatrick said there needed to be a coordinated multidisciplinary research program addressing some of the more important factors in the gulf such as ecosystem productivity and distribution of biodiversity.",
    "“There’s also a massive gap in our knowledge of the significance of the gulf for traditional owners, so there’s a real need to understand where, when, and how the traditional owners utilised the gulf,” Dr Fitzpatrick said.",
    "It was not until last year that four of the species including a short-nosed sea snake were found on an expedition, led by the Australian Institute of Marine Science, with the latter seen some 67 metres below the surface.",

    "“Information is lacking on the distribution of the coral reefs and the diverse sponge communities, we don’t know anything about where the sawfish are and they’re actually a critically endangered species,” he said.",
    "Four years later, the confirmation of the specimen as a rare species never seen so far south before only spurs more questions for marine scientists about both the mysterious critter and the place it was found.",
    "“A lot of work has not been done on this [Czeblukov’s] species which is why this record is exciting, it adds a lot to its distribution and a genetic sample we can find out how far this species moves to breed.",
    "The Ashmore Reef, which is about 600 kilometres north of Broome in the Kimberley, was once one of the most thriving ecosystems for sea snakes with 17 species and an estimated 40,000 individuals in the 1990s.",
    "Little research has been done in a water body once pegged for World Heritage Status, alongside the adjacent Ningaloo Reef and Cape Range National Park, compared to the Great Barrier Reef.",
    "For marine scientists the knowledge there are so many sea snake species in one place further solidifies the importance of the gulf, which also has more than 800 fish species present.",
    "James Cook University sea snake researcher Blanche d’Anastasi co-authored a paper published in Australian Zoologist this month on the visual identification of the sea snake.",
    "Genetic testing of the specimen will help scientists determine how closely related the Czeblukov’s sea snake found in the gulf is to the few samples taken from other sites.",
    "Share\nNormal text sizeLarger text sizeVery large text size\nA dead sea snake with a Russian name and black hexagon-covered skin once washed up on the shores of Exmouth Gulf.",
    "The Czeblukov’s sea snake has been found previously around islands of Papua New Guinea, the Arafura Sea and north west of the Pilbara town Dampier out in the Indian Ocean.",
    "The presence of such a unique species offered an opportunity for researchers to find out more about sea snakes generally with the animal understood to be in decline.",
    "Ms d’Anastasi said knowing Exmouth Gulf was still such a hotspot for sea snakes highlighted its importance as a reservoir of biodiversity for the aquatic creatures.",
    "Its discovery 300 kilometres south of Dampier at Exmouth takes the number of sea snakes found in its gulf to 11 out of the 24 species found in Western Australia.",
    "“Qualing Pool, for example has been identified as a significant area and has been earmarked as an a-class nature reserve based on the indigenous values there.",

    "Credit:Grant Griffin\nIn 2015 park rangers spotted a pair of then thought-to-be-extinct short-nosed sea snakes at the Ningaloo Reef.",
    "“The snake just washed up on the shore there dead and it had a pretty awesome little pattern and I wondered what it was,” he said.",
    "“There just hasn’t been the motivation or the factors that have warranted an investment in the fundamental marine research.",
    "“My whole focus in life as a scientist is conservation, and if we want to conserve things we have to know who lives where.",
    "So it’s a really rare thing.”\nMarine scientist Andrew Davenport surveying animals and habitat in Exmouth on a paddleboard.",
    "The conservation status of about 40 per cent of sea snake species is too hard to determine given a lack of data.",

    "“At this stage I wasn’t an expert in sea snakes, so we sent off pictures to a few different specialists.",
    "“From there we figured out this is a really rare species, there’s only been 14 records of it ever.",
    "“There hasn’t been much of a focus on Exmouth Gulf, ... it’s a blank part of the map so to speak.",
