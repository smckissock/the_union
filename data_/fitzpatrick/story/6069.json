    "What punter Matt Haack said about struggles last week against the #Jets as the Bills head into the wild-card round: https://t.co/cxrHTraGOb\nHaack was one of the least-utilized punters in the NFL last season, as Bills head coach Sean McDermott often took an aggressive approach on fourth-down calls, but he often struggled when called upon.",
    "The team will be getting a bigger cap hit for quarterback Josh Allen after giving him a big extension, and cap hits for some key members of the defense — Tremaine Edmunds, Micah Hyde, and Jordan Poyer will all have cap hits above $10 million — leave the Bills unable to make big moves.",
    "Because I know what his number is on the books for the upcoming years and we can just build around it.”\nBeane noted that the projected increase in the cap will give at least a bit more breathing room, but said the team will be unable to make any big moves.",

    "“We’ll still have to make some moves, but I wouldn’t see us being like, big spenders or anything like that, but we’ll look to fill some spots from the outside as well as retain some of our guys.”",
    "Some have already suggested that veterans like Cole Beasley and Star Lotulelei could be candidates, but WGR’s Nate Geary believes one of the most obvious cuts could come on special teams.",
