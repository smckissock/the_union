    "How the Dolphins used him that season offers the best clue for how Parker will be deployed in New England, where the front office is betting he will play closer to his ceiling than floor, which would look something like 10 or fewer game appearances and a few headaches for the fan base.",
    "Perhaps most importantly, Parker has system experience, having played under former Pats assistant and Dolphins offensive coordinator Chad O’Shea in 2019, when Miami ran a facsimile of the Patriots offense.",
    "In 2019, O’Shea loved isolating Parker in key situations — third downs, red zone and 2-minute drills — via 3×1 formations that forced defenses to commit most of their defensive backs to the opposite side.",
    "Sharpening the quick game\nFor all that Parker could introduce as a reliable downfield target, his impact should be felt first and foremost within 10-12 yards within the line of scrimmage.",
    "Parker is exactly what Harry should have been: a big-bodied X receiver who wins by snatching jump balls downfield and shielding off defenders in the short and intermediate areas.",
    "Considering Jones was the second-most blitzed quarterback in football last year, the quick passing game — already the offense’s foundation — isn’t going anywhere in New England.",
    "The veteran speedster regularly aligned as the lone receiver on the weak side of the offensive formation and was entrusted to win 1-on-1 or draw the attention of a deep safety.",
    "He rewarded the Patriots’ trust by becoming their least efficient option at the position, averaging 1.3 yards per route, lowest among wideouts who saw at least five targets.",
    "At his best, Parker has proven to be an all-around threat who specializes in contested catches, can win in isolation and possesses enough speed to threaten defenses deep.",
    "Even with defenders in his hip pocket, Parker’s catch rate on contested throws finished inside the NFL’s top 25 for a third straight year, per Player Profiler.",
    "An AFC executive recently told the Herald that Parker is not a true difference-maker, but acknowledged he should be the Patriots’ best receiver in 2022.",
    "That is the starting point for any player projection in the NFL, but especially an injury-prone receiver on a weapons-starved team like the Patriots.",
    "He saw more targets at ‘X’ than anyone in the league, and converted a staggering 90.5% of his isolated receptions into first downs or touchdowns.",
    "After O’Shea was fired that offseason, the percentage of Parker’s targets at ‘X’ decreased significantly, a shift that stole from his strengths.",
    "More immediately, Parker fits the Patriots’ offseason plan to date, an approach defined by familiar faces and future financial flexibility.",
    "Parker still has better long speed and more wiggle than Harry, but the advanced numbers are unkind to his play speed and how he applies it.",
    "Expect Parker to clear that bar again in 2022, and to be entrusted with dozens of third-down, red-zone and 2-minute throws from Mac Jones.",
    "‘X’ marks the spot\nDespite missing three games last season, no Patriots receiver took more snaps at the “X” position than Nelson Agholor.",
    "Over the past three seasons, Parker has secured more than 80% of his catchable targets on back-shoulder or fade throws, per Sports Info.",
    "More specifically, they wanted the ball out quickly and over the middle, as Parker broke off 46% of his routes inside, per Sports Info.",
    "The Patriots will also move Parker around, as they do all their receivers, meaning more opportunities over the middle should surface.",
    "In Parker, the Patriots have a 29-year-old player they know, someone who produced three 100-yard performances over a dozen meetings.",
    "In 2019, more than 75% of his catches, yards and touchdowns were generated on passing plays triggered by a 3-step drop or shorter.",
    "1 target whose emergence would allow the team’s other wideouts to settle into supporting roles that better fit their skill level.",
    "But over his seven-year career, he’s also played in every regular-season game just once and battled a career’s worth of injuries.",
    "He also carries cap hits just north of $6 million the next two seasons, a steal considering the current wide receiver market.",
    "But how much of a difference will depend entirely on his location: whether Parker’s on the field or in the training room.",
    "Defenders afforded him the 11th-leanest cushion in the league at 5.9 yards off the line, unafraid of getting beat deep.",
    "The Dolphins wanted the ball out quickly, with Ryan Fitzpatrick pulling the trigger behind a turnstile offensive line.",
    "That year Parker sizzled, posting career highs in catches (72), receiving yards (1,202) and receiving touchdowns (9).",
    "Nonetheless, he finished with a 2.1 yards per route run average when isolated last year, a top-25 mark in the league.",
    "Solutions, Parker ran more routes as a single-side receiver in 2019 than every other wideout except Michael Thomas.",
    "“He’s a big target on the end of routes, in cuts and crossing routes, things like that,” Belichick said in 2020.",
    "Overall, Parker averaged 2.9 yards per route when isolated, eighth among receivers who saw at least 30 passes.",
    "So if Parker stays on the field, here’s how the 6-foot-3, 219-pounder should lift the Patriots’ passing game.",
    "Working 1-on-1, Parker would often out-muscle his defender on a slant or win on a back-shoulder fade.",
    "Because upside is what Bill Belichick chased when he traded for Parker last week: a potential No.",
    "He should fulfill every expectation set for 2019 first-rounder N’Keal Harry the past three years.",
    "That, of course, does make a difference to an offense starved for quality depth and talent.",
    "N’Keal Harry 3.0\nOK, so Parker will work 1-on-1 more often than any other Pats receiver.",
    "Last season, Parker ranked dead last in average separation, per Next Gen Stats.",
    "Thanks to Parker, the Pats no longer need to count on Agholor at that spot.",
    "Not by smoking cornerbacks off the line, but dunking on them downfield.",
    "Running those routes, he’s averaged more than 22 yards per reception.",
    "His chief strengths are elite body control, strong hands and size.",
    "When healthy, he towered over corners, terrorized them.",
    "His nine touchdowns ranked third in the league.",
    "He also thrived working the seams.",
    "DeVante Parker must stay healthy.",
    "He’s a master of the fade route.",
    "That ranked third in the NFL.",
    "According to Sports Info.",
    "This is how he wins deep.",
    "If Parker stays healthy.",
    "Solutions.",
    "What else?",
    "Solutions.",
    "How?"
