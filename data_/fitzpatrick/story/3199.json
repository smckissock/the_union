    "ne of the topics occupying the front pages of the international media today, in addition to the war conflict between Russia and Ukraine, is the nightmare that WNBA star Brittney Griner is suffering, detained since February in Russian territory and facing drug possession charges for which she could go to jail for five to 10 years.",

    "The suffering of Griner and all her loved ones has touched the hearts of her country and, although so far the authorities have not been able to bring her back, the request made to all those who are attentive to the WNBA star's condition is to at least pray for her.",

    "Griner was arrested by Russian authorities on charges of smuggling significant quantities of a narcotic substance after she apparently carried cannabis in her luggage, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
    "Armstrong herself reflects on the possible reasons why the Russian government would have detained Griner and asks that people not conflate the basketball player's old controversies with her current ordeal.",

    "Last Monday Cherelle Griner, wife of the Phoenix Mercury player, shared her painful experience on social media and expressed her sorrow at not hearing from Brittney since her arrest in February.",
    "But I'm a believer, and I can't think of what else the average person can do right now to help WNBA star Brittney Griner besides that.",
    "Everyone must ask themselves every single what-if here: What if she were male, white, not queer, not outspoken on injustices, etc.",
    "Griner is an American citizen - and she is desperately in need of her country's help right now,\" Armstrong wrote.",
    "Please don't email me about Griner's previous league suspensions because of domestic violence, or anything else.",
    "\"I don't follow the WNBA, but as an African American woman, I can't help but empathize with Griner's struggle.",
    "She is in big trouble and needs some good energy shared on her behalf right about now,\" Armstrong added.",
    "It also cannot be forgotten that Russia is a country with harsh laws against the LGBTQ+ community.",
    "Yet, there's not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you.",
