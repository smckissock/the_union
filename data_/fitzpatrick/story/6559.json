    "GREATEST NFL PLAYOFF WEEKEND EVER\nBengals-Titans: game-winning FG\n49ers-Packers: game-winning FG\nRams-Bucs: game-winning FG\nBills-Chiefs: game-winning TD in OT pic.twitter.com/s0OLAYrF93\n— SB Nation (@SBNation) January 24, 2022\nBut Payton sharply disagreed with the defensive strategy that the Bills employed on the following plays, when they used a defensive formation that would have been more fitting against a team with no timeouts and needed to get out of bounds.",
    "We would play outside man technique with a three-man rush, funneling balls to the middle of the field and contesting outside technique.”\nPayton Supports Rule Change\nWhile he placed the blame on Buffalo’s coaching staff for the strategy in the final seconds against the Chiefs, Payton did seem to have sympathy for how the game played out after that.",
    "Payton, who announced his retirement from the Saints, opened up to NBC Sports’ Peter King in a wide-ranging interview that covered the heartbreaking end to Buffalo’s season in the divisional round of the playoffs.",
    "After the collapse, many criticized the Bills for kicking off deep following the touchdown, giving the Chiefs a touchback rather than forcing them to return a short kick and take time off the clock.",
    "Payton said he actually agreed with this strategy, saying he didn’t like the high risks of a squib kick or a high, pop-fly just short of the goal line that the kicker likely hasn’t practiced much.",
    "Payton Blasts Bills\nThe Bills had a frantic end to their season, taking the lead twice in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter against the Chiefs only to see Kansas City respond both times.",
    "“At least for the postseason, each team should get a possession, and if it’s tied after those two possessions, the game continues, and it’s sudden death starting with the third possession.”",
    "Payton pointed to what he called a “flawed” defensive strategy that allowed the Kansas City Chiefs to race down the field for a game-tying field goal before ultimately winning in overtime.",
    "Buffalo’s final touchdown came with just 13 seconds left in the fourth, but the Chiefs made two quick passes to get into field goal range and tie the game before winning in overtime.",
    "“You see when Travis Kelce catches that long pass to put them in field-goal range, a cornerback is defending an area of the field near the sidelines he doesn’t need to defend.",
    "Sean Payton has had some extra time to watch football since stepping away from the New Orleans Saints, and shared some harsh words about what he saw from the Buffalo Bills.",
    "The Chiefs won the overtime coin toss and drove for a game-winning touchdown, never allowing the Bills and Josh Allen a chance to respond.",
    "Many criticized the league’s overtime format, which has heavily favored the team winning the coin toss, and Payton joined them.",
    "“We are playing football still—you can’t be defending the sidelines at all costs, like Buffalo was,” Payton said.",
    "The NFL shouldn’t change the overtime rules because the Bills got screwed (they did not get screwed).",
    "pic.twitter.com/dDs8L1ThNp\n— Mina Kimes (@minakimes) January 24, 2022\n“We’ve hit the threshold.",
    "They should change them because a system where teams that win the toss go 10-1 stinks!",
    "The Chiefs had two timeouts, using them after long plays down the middle of the field.",
    "Kansas City’s got two timeouts left—they don’t need to get out of bounds.",
    "Sean McDermott looks on during a game against the Kansas City Chiefs.",
    "Everything about what Buffalo did defensively is flawed.",
    "The latest Bills news straight to your inbox!",

    "There has to be some change,” he said."
