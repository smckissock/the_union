    "Carson Wentz will 'probably' be cut or traded before March 19 when his $15 million base salary becomes fully guaranteed, per @mortreport pic.twitter.com/yDDA3iIS76\n— B/R Gridiron (@brgridiron) February 13, 2022\nThe Bills have also lost the other two quarterbacks from the 2021 season.",
    "Here’s @mortreport on ESPN saying the Colts are preparing to move on from Carson Wentz pic.twitter.com/Ymg9L4bcOm\n— Matt Mullin (@matt_mullin) February 13, 2022\n“For Carson Wentz and the Indianapolis Colts, it looks bleak,” Mortensen said on ESPN on February 13.",
    "The Bills invested heavily in quarterback depth last offseason, beating out other teams to land Mitch Trubisky by selling him on the promise of improving under the same coaching staff that helped Josh Allen blossom into one of the league’s top quarterbacks.",
    "“And I’ve told him and his agent, if he doesn’t get what he wants, we’ve got a spot for him.”\nTrubisky was solid in his limited appearances in relief of Allen last season, completing six of eight passes for 75 yards and adding a rushing touchdown.",
    "The player this year is Carson Wentz, who went to the Indianapolis Colts but struggled as the team ended the year on a two-game losing skid, including a season-ending loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars that left them short of the playoffs.",
    "Bills Could Target Former Top Pick\nThe Bills could have the chance to target another quarterback in a situation nearly identical to Trubisky last season — a former high first-round pick with talent but in need of a change of scenery.",
    "Trubisky Could Still Return\nThe Bills seem committed to their original plan for Trubisky, which was to allow him to develop for a season under the same coaching staff who helped Allen and then hope he can return to a starting job.",
    "… So, for Carson Wentz and the Colts, it looks like it was a one-year marriage that went wrong.”\nJon Scott, the Bills beat reporter for Spectrum News, wrote that Wentz should be a top target for the Bills.",
    "Bills general manager Brandon Beane said that he was willing to help Trubisky out in free agency, but stressed that he would still have a place behind Allen if he wanted to return.",
    "The New York Giants poached former 2020 draft pick Jake Fromm from the Bills’ practice squad late in the season after an injury to Daniel Jones.",
    "Trubisky is now likely headed to free agency and the chance to compete for a starting job, and the Bills will be looking for a replacement.",
    "Whether Wentz or another signal-caller becomes a target, the Bills will need to make some additions to the quarterback room behind Allen.",
    "The Buffalo Bills will be in the market for a new backup quarterback this offseason, and one insider thinks that another former No.",
    "“When it comes to #Bills back-up QB, Wentz should be at top of wish list on a Trubisky-type deal,” Scott tweeted.",
    "As ESPN’s Chris Mortensen reported, the Colts are ready to cut ties and plan to either trade or release Wentz.",
    "“If anybody calls me about Mitch on another team, I’m going to give him a great recommendation,” Beane said.",
    "Wentz took much of the blame for the failure to make the playoffs, as he struggled down the stretch.",
    "The Giants also signed now-former Bills backup Davis Webb to a futures contract.",
    "“Yes, the Colts did not give him support verbally after the season.",
    "Said that they weren’t guaranteeing him anything.",

    "2 overall pick could be a target.",
    "Well, right now, it looks bleak."
