    "“It’s a very, very small percentage of funds that can come from the state.”\nWhen asked about the critiques that the state has not done enough to take action on these issues, New Hampshire Department of Energy spokesperson Rorie Patterson said the agency “recognizes the risk posed by climate change and that actions are required to mitigate those risks.” Patterson also pointed to the department’s efforts to implement clean energy programs authorized by lawmakers and Gov.",
    "The Ammonoosuc Regional Energy Team, founded in 2008 by local energy committee members in the area, takes lots of different approaches to encourage energy efficiency across the North Country, from organizing educational fairs to advocating for a solar array at the Profile High School in Bethlehem.",
    "Because I have to at least try.”\nAs climate change threatens New Hampshire communities with rising sea levels, increasing heat, worse storms and strange winters, New Hampshire leaders have been slower to take action with strong policy responses than their counterparts in neighboring states.",
    "Small drops in a big bucket\nJim Fitzpatrick, the chair of Franconia’s energy commission and a co-lead on that regional energy team, has seen firsthand how local energy projects like the ones Van Houten is championing in Bethlehem can inspire voters in other communities.",
    "While Patterson did not directly address a question from NHPR about how the state views the role of local communities in its energy strategy, she noted that the agency oversees rebate and grant programs that have supported energy projects at the municipal level.",
    "But volunteer-led efforts at the local level are playing a leading role in New Hampshire’s energy transition, encouraging municipalities to adopt interventions like weatherizing buildings and installing solar panels to help mitigate climate change.",
    "Around that time, communities across the state started passing resolutions calling for a stronger federal response to climate change, and some residents started forming their own local groups focused on saving energy and reducing emissions.",
    "Reframing climate conversations\nIn some communities, those leading the way on local energy committees have struggled to convince their neighbors to take an interest in climate solutions — or talk about climate change at all.",
    "Local energy committees, like the one Dunbar recently launched in Bow, started gaining steam as organizers in New Hampshire worked to build awareness on climate issues ahead of the 2008 presidential election.",
    "But even though he and other local energy advocates are making progress to steer their communities away from fossil fuels, he worries these solutions aren’t matched with the global scale of the problem.",
    "“I had this all too clear vision in my mind of how fragile the world was.”\nAs Dunbar started paying more attention to climate news, she found herself feeling scared for the future and for her children.",
    "But Melissa Elander, who works with communities in the North Country to implement energy projects through Clean Energy New Hampshire, said the state has provided little support for energy committees.",

    "But he said it’s been a long road, trying to find funding and rally community support while also parsing through the complicated energy policies that might influence these projects.",
    "They gathered information for a detailed discussion about how the town could pay for it and how it might benefit the community, preparing to defend the plan to their fellow voters.",
    "“It ain’t gonna make any difference, in the big picture.”\nBut the work that local energy volunteers are propelling in towns like Franconia and Bethlehem is making some difference.",
    "In Bethlehem, Van Houten said many people get interested in energy issues when the price of fuel oil is high, but it can be hard to keep attention sustained for the long haul.",
    "Instead of focusing on how projects like energy efficiency retrofits at the town hall could slow down global warming, he’s tried to emphasize how they save taxpayers money.",
    "Still, local leaders say gaining momentum for energy projects at the municipal level has been difficult to manage given limited time, resources and support from the state.",
    "These days, Van Houten is working on bringing more solar to Bethlehem: on the roof of the library, atop the highway garage and behind the town’s elementary school.",
    "According to data from Clean Energy New Hampshire, projects in Coos and northern Grafton Counties alone are saving more than a million kilowatt hours every year.",
    "He hasn’t seen a clear vision for that in New Hampshire at the state level and feels like local energy committees are often left without the support they need.",
    "“It would be nice to be part of a larger team,” said David Van Houten, who has been involved with local energy issues in his town, Bethlehem, for 15 years.",
    "It’ll cost the town, up-front, a bit less than a new police cruiser and a skid loader — two other items voters approved on this year’s town warrant.",
    "When Fitzpatrick and others on Franconia's local energy committee pitched a new solar array on this year’s town warrant, they expected some debate.",
    "Van Houten said he envies those who live in other states where political leaders are taking more decisive action to respond to climate change.",
    "New Hampshire has passed legislation in the last few years to give communities more options for energy transitions at the municipal level.",
    "Van Houten is part of a regional effort to encourage the development of sustainable energy practices with a few other towns in the region.",
    "“I would have to say that most of what I see happening at the municipal level is happening largely without state support,” she said.",

    "“Why ain’t Franconia doing it?”\nFranconia’s planned array is also relatively small and inexpensive.",
    "Fitzpatrick thinks the visibility of similar energy projects in the area helped to win voters over.",
