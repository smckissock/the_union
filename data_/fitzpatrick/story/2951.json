    "That's how I started and I always hearken back to one of my favorite all-time investors, Peter Lynch, who argued in his classic book on Wall Street that ordinary investors did not need really to understand computers to notice that Dell was onto something or have PhDs in biology to know that Amgen had made strides in the biotech field.",
    "This is how we originally come across the idea and then we do our own thorough, rigorous, fundamental, bottoms-up business analysis on the company, which could take anywhere from weeks to months, after we've done all of that business analysis, we use that analysis to try to estimate the fair value of that business and then that stock.",
    "Yasser El-Shimy: Because both Auri and you bring up very important points here which is the importance of just not paying attention to what's around and what do you think has a bright future ahead, but this is just the very first step of finding an attractive idea that could potentially be an investment.",
    "I spent two months, literally, doing a deep dive on KKR because of that one sentence that I read in a Scott Miller letter, where he said, and I'm paraphrasing, but it was something almost identical to, \"If I could only own one stock for the next five years, it would be KKR.\"",
    "But the great thing about this is the smart person has already looked at the company and vetted it, so you can read investor letters from your favorite investors, a few people I like are these gentlemen named Scott Miller, Terry Smith, and really understand their thinking.",
    "So I think that's great because you can get a consensus based on the customers that are actually using some of these software products or products online which are great because I love to get as close to the customer as possible and understand why they like this product.",

    "Whenever I'm reading a news article, whenever I'm watching even TV, or even just looking around, I try to see things that I'd like to use, things that I believe have a bright future ahead, and just try to imagine what that future could look like.",
    "I want to look at the management discussion and analysis, understand the business model, and then understand some of the risks that are inherent to that business, and then next, probably, look at the last two quarters over the conference call.",
    "That was simply by just looking around and seeing all these brown boxes arriving at the doorsteps of my neighbors, and starting to use the service myself and just loving it, and realizing, you know what, this is the future of commerce.",
    "I also look at return on invested capital and how that has grown over time, earnings growth, and in my view, a great company that promises to be a good investment or a great investment will show improvement over time on these metrics.",
    "Then usually, by that time, I have a good understanding of the business, maybe I'll read some more articles online, and then by that time, I should have an understanding whether I want to continue further, whether it's investable.",
    "Only by keeping tabs on these things can you actually see how the company is delivering on its key performance indicators over time, and therefore, whether this management team is actually delivering on the things that matter.",
    "If I still am interested in the company at that point, I will dig deeper into the latest earnings call, the 10-K or 20-F, if it's a foreign company and any available third-party research I can lay my hand on.",
    "The service saves us a ton of time that, otherwise, we would have to spend going to individual stores to shop for every single item and arrives conveniently, seamlessly, and is actually cost competitive too.",
    "Some of the investments we make are companies, let's say, software-as-a service companies that, as just individual [inaudible 00:10:49] , we may never have the opportunity to try out the product.",

    "Once you develop that understanding, then you can hone in with developing the list of key performance indicators, or KPIs, that you want to monitor over time in that business.",
    "Yasser, what does your step-by-step process look like to get you comfortable enough with the business to decide if you think it's a good time to buy or sell the stock?",
    "That to me is part and parcel of making this a very personal experience of investing and just actually judging for myself the quality of the service or the product.",
    "It's a source I love because I know it has been vetted, and then I can go back to understand the company myself, and I know smart people have taken a look at it.",
    "You'd be surprised how many investors just jump in head-first into growth companies based on that promise that they might be the next FANG stock, the big stock.",
    "There you have it, Fools, how two of The Motley Fool investing team's top analysts identify stock ideas and do their research process in a step-by-step manner.",

    "I want to see how some of the biggest investors out there, both on the growth and value size of investing, are thinking about this particular business.",

    "John Rotonti: When you read a statement like that from an investor that you respect and admire so much, it almost compels you to do further research.",
    "I can look at 13Fs, or Dataroma, or WhaleWisdom to see what stocks these big funds or money managers are holding, and then research from there.",
    "Now, once I've established that background, and I'm still interested, I will dig deeper into valuation multiples, especially compared to peers.",
    "Chuck Akre and his team at Akre Capital, Bill Nygren at Oakmark, the team at ValueAct Capital, one of my favorite investors in the world, C.T.",
    "In a cloud SaaS business, that might be something else, like remaining performance obligations, RPOs, or net dollar expansion rates, NDERs.",
    "So when you read a statement like that from an investor that you respect and admire so much, it almost compels you to do further research.",

    "In one of his letters, maybe a year ago, he mentioned that if he could only own one stock for the next five years, it would be KKR.",
    "*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them!",
    "All you need to do is just to look around, imagine the future, and pay attention, and chances are, you will do well from there.",

    "John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.",
