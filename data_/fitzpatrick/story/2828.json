    "The weather is expected to play a factor over the weekend, and the Irishman is one of the world’s best playing under inclement conditions.”\nSungjae Im, 44-1\n“Im has past success in the Sunshine State with a victory at the 2020 Honda Classic and top-four finishes at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Valspar Championship.”\nGary Woodland, 80-1\n“Woodland looked like he was going to win at Bay Hill last week with an eagle at 16, but promptly gave it back with a double bogey at 17 and tied for fifth.”\nAlex Noren, 90-1\n“Noren has finished in the top six in two of his last three events with a tie for sixth in Phoenix and a tie for fifth at the Honda Classic.”\nContact reporter Todd Dewey at tdewey@reviewjournal.com.",
    "“The putter let him down from being in contention, but putting has the most variance of anything, so he can clearly turn it around here at Sawgrass, where he was the 54-hole leader three years ago and finished tied for ninth last year.”\nSherman also took Rahm (-150) in a matchup over Collin Morikawa.",
    "Players Championship\nAt Westgate SuperBook\nUp to 30-1\nJon Rahm 10-1\nCollin Morikawa 16-1\nJustin Thomas 16-1\nRory McIlroy 20-1\nViktor Hovland 20-1\nPatrick Cantlay 20-1\nScottie Scheffler 25-1\nHideki Matsuyama 25-1\nDaniel Berger 25-1\nXander Schauffele 30-1\nDustin Johnson 30-1",

    "His last three tournaments on the PGA Tour have all been top-10 finishes, and he finished ninth here last year.”\nBilly Horschel, 50-1\nJoaquin Niemann, 54-1\nSherman got Niemann at 70-1, and Horschel at 80-1.",
    "Handicapper Wes Reynolds, co-host of VSiN’s “Long Shots” golf betting show, and Westgate SuperBook oddsmaker Jeff Sherman like Rahm as one of their best bets to win golf’s unofficial fifth major.",
    "The missed gimme putt didn’t stop oddsmakers from installing Rahm as the clear favorite to win the Players Championship, which tees off Thursday at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.",
    "“When he opened at 14-1, that seemed like an overadjustment on him in relation to everybody else.”\nReynolds noted that Rahm has won twice on Pete Dye designs and is a fan of Dye layouts.",
    "He is the joint course record holder at TPC Sawgrass with a 63.”\nShane Lowry, 42-1\n“Lowry, like Berger, posted his best-ever Players finish last year with an eighth.",

    "He has two top-10 finishes here.”\nBrooks Koepka, 40-1\n“Koepka has drifted down enough in the market to make this an attractive price.",
    "Here are Sherman’s other best bets (with comments):\nHideki Matsuyama, 30-1\n“He’s just been solid this year.",
    "1 player, after he missed a 10-inch putt in last week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational.",
