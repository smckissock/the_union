    "\"This is a good example of when a coach understands the scheme—which he does, Coach Smith—and he takes an athlete like this and can use him in a variety of ways I think you see the kind of production that he can have,\" franchise owner Arthur Blank said, per Scott Bair of the team's official website.",
    "That was an overpay because, while Golladay has proven that he can be a Pro Bowler in the right situation, he previously played with a high-end quarterback in Matthew Stafford and was coming off an injury-plagued season (hamstring).",
    "That's $4 million more than veterans Andy Dalton and Ryan Fitzpatrick made a year ago to fill similar roles, and it's far more than a team should be willing to (but will) pay Trubisky this offseason.",
    "Last offseason, for example, the Tennessee Titans inked Bud Dupree to a five-year, $82.5 million contract even though he was coming off a torn ACL and had just one season with more than eight sacks.",
    "As is always the case, a fair bit of cash will be thrown around during the \"legal tampering\" window and in the first few days of free agency as teams look to outbid one another for the top players.",
    "Connor Williams, LG\nGuard Connor Williams will be coveted in free agency because of his age (24), starting experience (51 games) and status as a member of the long-respected Cowboys offensive line.",
    "Knee and elbow injuries limited Armstead to eight games in 2021—he underwent knee surgery in January—and he missed 21 games between 2016 and 2018 with various lower- and upper-body injuries.",
    "We're not saying that these aren't good players—and we'll never fault anyone for maximizing their value—but for one reason or another, they're going to earn more than they should.",
    "Players get overpaid on the open market quite frequently—factors like age, injury history, inconsistent production and positional value often make deals look bad in retrospect.",
    "However, some team is likely to take a chance on Trubisky as a bridge quarterback or as starting competition because of his age (27), draft status and win-loss record (29-21).",
    "While Patterson has shown that he can be a valuable contributor, this is a high price point for a soon-to-be 31-year-old (March 17) who faded down the stretch last season.",
    "The 30-year-old Armstead is a three-time Pro Bowler, plays one of the game's premier positions and should theoretically improve whichever offensive line he joins.",
    "With Philadelphia and Arizona this past season, Ertz caught just 66.1 percent of his targets while providing a passer rating of only 85.5 when targeted.",
    "The problem here is that New Orleans Saints tackle has a significant injury history and represents a big risk entering the back half of his career.",
    "Randy Gregory, Edge\nDallas Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory is another player likely to take advantage of the NFL's premium on pass-rushers.",
    "David Njoku, Mike Gesicki and Dalton Schultz all received the franchise tag, which leaves Ertz as one of the most notable options available.",
    "Mitchell Trubisky, QB\nLike Ertz, Buffalo Bills quarterback Mitchell Trubisky is going to see a boost in value because of a shrinking market.",
    "Ertz, who was traded from the Eagles to the Arizona Cardinals midseason, finished 2021 with 74 catches for 763 yards and five touchdowns.",
    "Gregory was the 60th pick in the 2015 draft but has been suspended multiple times for violations of the league's substance-abuse policy.",
    "Brandon Scherff, RG\nLike Armstead, Washington Commanders guard Brandon Scherff is one of the top free agents on the market this season.",
    "Terron Armstead is one of the league's best left tackles when healthy, and he's the third-ranked player on our free-agency big board.",
    "He has an estimated market value of $23.9 million annually, which is way too much for a soon-to-be 31-year-old with injury concerns.",
    "He spent time on injured reserve with a calf injury but appeared in 12 games, finishing with six sacks and 29 quarterback pressures.",
    "That's even more than Scherff, who is older and has durability concerns but has proven himself to be a top-tier player when healthy.",
    "That's a fair price for the talent, but it's an overpay for a player who can only be counted on to play two-thirds of a season.",
    "And while there's still time for Trubisky to turn his career around, someone will overpay to give him an opportunity in 2022.",
    "Williams is not a top-tier guard, but he's poised to earn more than all but seven other guards are currently making annually.",
    "Gregory has just 12 starts on his resume and has never played more than 55 percent of his team's defensive snaps in a season.",
    "Patterson's value also hinges on him returning to the Falcons or landing with a team willing to use him in a similar manner.",
    "This means that teams seeking a veteran quarterback will largely have to wade into an underwhelming free-agent player pool.",
    "Philadelphia Eagles pass-rusher Derek Barnett appears poised to be one of this year's beneficiaries of a hot edge market.",
    "Cordarrelle Patterson, RB/WR\nCordarrelle Patterson was an All-Pro return specialist four times prior to the 2021 season.",
    "However, it's worth noting that the Dallas line wasn't elite in 2021—it surrendered 33 sacks during the regular season.",
    "However, Gregory—who will turn 30 in November—has yet to reach that potential and may be running out of time to do so.",
    "According to Pro Football Focus, Williams allowed just a single sack but was responsible for a whopping 15 penalties.",
    "It's clear that Ertz isn't the same reliable receiver he once was, and his blocking has never been a standout trait.",
    "However, he may still be free agency's highest-paid tight end thanks to a market suddenly lacking in younger talent.",
    "Zach Ertz, TE\nA dwindling tight end market will likely drive up the demand for 31-year-old pass-catcher Zach Ertz.",
    "Last offseason, for example, the New York Giants gave a four-year, $72 million contract to wideout Kenny Golladay.",
    "Trubisky, who was taken second overall in the 2017 draft by the Chicago Bears, is himself an underwhelming option.",
    "That's the antithesis of dependability, which should (but probably won't be) a red flag for prospective employers.",
    "The Seattle Seahawks and Indianapolis Colts have already traded Russell Wilson and Carson Wentz, respectively.",
    "This is a high price point for a 29-year-old who lacks proven production and has a notable suspension history.",
    "Pro Football Focus projects him to land a three-year, $37.5 million deal that includes $25 million guaranteed.",
    "Derek Barnett, Edge\nPass-rushers are always at a premium in free agency, and this can lead to inflated deals.",
    "He hasn't played a full campaign since the 2016 season, and he's missed 22 games over the past four years.",
    "We'll dive into each individual player and situation below, and players are listed in alphabetical order.",
    "Golladay appeared in 14 games for the Giants in 2021 and finished with just 521 yards and no touchdowns.",
    "This price point would make Armstead the NFL's highest-paid offensive tackle in terms of annual salary.",
    "History suggests Armstead won't be on the field enough for the team that signs him to fully capitalize.",
    "Pro Football Focus projects a two-year, $20 million deal for Ertz that includes $12 million guaranteed.",
    "Pro Football Focus projects Gregory to land a two-year, $32 million deal with $21.5 million guaranteed.",
    "\"The sky's the limit for Randy Gregory,\" Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy said, per ESPN's Todd Archer.",
    "While Gregory has never had more than six sacks in a season, he showed quite a bit of upside in 2021.",
    "Atlanta took full advantage of Patterson's skill set, unleashing him as both a runner and a receiver.",
    "He has a career passer rating of only 87.0 and failed to pan out as a quality starter with the Bears.",
    "That's what teams can expect from Scherff, who hasn't played more than 13 games in a year since 2017.",
    "Pro Football Focus projects him to land a one-year, $14 million deal with $10.5 million guaranteed.",
    "It will be virtually impossible for a team to hedge its bet on Armstead with a below-market deal.",
    "Patterson can be an asset, but he'll have a hard time replicating his 2021 statistical success.",
    "Terron Armstead, LT\nLet's be clear: A bad contract doesn't mean a bad player or a bad signing.",
    "He finished the year with 618 rushing yards, 548 receiving yards and 11 combined touchdowns.",
    "Barnett has never produced more than 6.5 in a season, and he has just 21.5 over five years.",
    "Then, he reinvented himself as an all-around offensive weapon with the Atlanta Falcons.",
    "This means that Williams could pretty much be counted on to draw a flag once per game.",
    "Aaron Rodgers has announced that he plans to return to the Green Bay Packers in 2022.",
    "Patterson enters free agency with an estimated market value of $9.1 million annually.",
    "Teams can legally begin contacting and negotiating with players at noon ET on Monday.",
    "Of course, this doesn't mean that every early (or big) signing will be a great one.",
    "The NFL is set to kick off its 2022 edition of free agency in a matter of days.",
    "Here, we'll dive into eight impending free agents who will be overpaid in 2022.",
    "While Scherff is only 30 years old, he may already be breaking down physically.",
    "Yet, Scherff will be paid for his on-field performance, not his availability.",
    "Dupree appeared in 11 games and recorded three sacks for the Titans in 2021.",
    "In his last Pro Bowl campaign (2019), Ertz provided a passer rating of 96.4.",
    "He can still be a high-end starter, but durability is a legitimate concern.",
    "No one will fault a team for overpaying to land the five-time Pro Bowler.",
    "Sacks aren't everything, and Barnett is a starting-caliber defensive end.",
    "He finished the 2021 season with two sacks and 22 quarterback pressures.",
    "He was hampered by a knee ailment this past season and missed six games.",
    "Advanced statistics from Pro Football Reference unless otherwise noted.",
    "The potential to be great is there, and Gregory will get paid for it.",
    "The new league year (and free agency) will officially begin at 4 p.m.",
    "Now, Barnett isn't coming off of a significant injury as Dupree was.",
    "He's the best tackle available, and there will be a bevy of bidders.",
    "He averaged less than four yards per carry in his final five games.",
    "Williams has an estimated market value of $13.2 million annually.",
    "Scherff has an estimated market value of $12.9 million annually.",
    "However, Ertz wasn't particularly efficient with his production.",
    "2 sack artist, and his proven production suggests he isn't that.",
    "However, Scherff has regularly missed time because of injuries.",
    "*Contract information via Spotrac unless otherwise noted.",
    "However, his sack production is even more underwhelming.",
    "In all, he missed 54 games over his first six years.",
    "However, he's about to be paid like a high-end No.",
    "Williams, meanwhile, was notably mistake-prone.",
    "He's one of the league's top interior linemen.",
    "He has never played a full season in the NFL.",
    "Scherff, though, will be overpaid.",
    "ET on Wednesday, March 16."
