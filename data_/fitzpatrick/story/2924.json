    "There are other moves that Washington could make to clear more space — restructuring Ereck Flowers’ $10 million contact, for example — but at the very least, Washington looks it’ll work around the margins rather than make a big splash like the team did a year ago when it signed quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, cornerback William Jackson and wide receiver Curtis Samuel in the opening days of free agency.",
    "Wentz’s $28.3 million cap hit next season throws a huge wrench into how the Burgundy and Gold could attack free agency — which begins Monday when the NFL’s “legal tampering window” opens, allowing teams to negotiate and strike deals with other teams’ free agents.",
    "“What we spend there,” general manager Martin Mayhew said earlier this month regarding a quarterback, “obviously we can’t spend somewhere else.”\nFortunately, coach Ron Rivera’s best moves in Washington have arguably been in the bargain bin — whether it was J.D.",
    "That’s why the team was reportedly looking to reunite him with one of his favorite targets, former Eagle Zach Ertz -— before the tight end resigned Sunday with the Arizona Cardinals, who traded for the 30-year-old in October.",
    "While Mayhew tried to walk back an earlier statement that seemed to all but confirm Scherff’s pending departure, the reality is that the two sides have spent years negotiating and have been unable to come to an agreement.",
    "Other names to watch include Carter, tackle Cornelius Lucas, cornerback Danny Johnson, defensive tackle Tim Settle and special-teams ace Troy Apke — each of whom provided solid depth on Washington’s roster.",
    "It also wouldn’t be surprising to see a team take a flyer on Lucas as the 30-year-old has starting experience and has played well when given the opportunity.",
    "But that number will grow if they choose not to tender some of their nine restricted free agents (reportedly the plan for backup quarterback Kyle Allen).",
    "Factor in Landon Collins’ expected release — clearing another $6.5 million — and Washington will hit free agency with roughly $12 million in space.",
    "Needs, needs, needs\nDespite Rivera’s confidence in the roster, Washington was still a 7-10 team in 2021 and has areas that need upgrades.",
    "Of them, Settle will likely land a bigger role elsewhere since he’s been stuck behind Daron Payne, Jonathan Allen and Matt Ioannidis.",
    "Denver’s Josey Jewell may be an affordable Plan B — PFF projects a one-year, $6 million deal — but he’s coming off a torn pectoral.",
    "By agreeing to take on Wentz’s full salary, the Commanders now have only $5.8 million in cap space, according to Over The Cap.",
    "To leave or not to leave\nThe Commanders have 19 unrestricted free agents set to hit the market, according to Over The Cap.",
    "The NFL Network listed the running back as a top under-the-radar free agent who could command up to $6 million annually.",
    "Klein has been linked to the Commanders since Rivera drafted him in Carolina and Buffalo recently cut the linebacker.",
    "The Seahawks released Bobby Wagner, but the future Hall of Famer is likely to be out of Washington’s price range.",
    "If McCain leaves, the defense will need to find a roaming free safety who can take away the middle of the field.",
    "And that’s before factoring in the $4 million or so the team has to set aside to sign its incoming rookie class.",
    "Outside of Scherff, Washington has expressed interest in retaining McKissic, McCain and wide receiver Cam Sims.",
    "Just last week, the Washington Commanders seemed poised to hit free agency with plenty of salary-cap space.",
    "Signs point to Scherff leaving the Commanders after playing two straight years on the franchise tag.",
    "After the season, Lucas simply said “commitment” would be what he’s looking for in free agency.",
    "Middle linebacker is near the top of the list and there are a number of veterans on the market.",
    "The biggest name on the market from Washington will be All-Pro guard Brandon Scherff.",
    "Guard, wide receiver and safety are other positions Washington could look to fill.",
    "McKissic and Logan Thomas in Year 1 or Bobby McCain and DeAndre Carter in Year 2.",
    "Pro Football Focus projects Scherff to sign a three-year, $50 million deal.",
    "Elsewhere, Washington will likely look to bolster the talent around Wentz.",
    "Now, he’ll have to try and replicate that template once again.",
    "— to perhaps make Scherff the league’s highest-paid guard.",
    "But they could face obstacles — especially with McKissic.",
    "McKissic,” NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo said on the air.",
    "“Acts of kindness and extending the wealth,” he said.",
    "That paves the way for another team — the Bengals?",
    "“There’s going to be significant interest in J.D.",
    "Then, they traded for Carson Wentz.",
    "And what would show him that?",
    "The Jets?",
    "A.J."
