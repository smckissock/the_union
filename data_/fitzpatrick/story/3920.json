Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, the two co-chairs of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in Congress.",
    "In 2021, the White House and congressional Democratic leaders sought to enact Biden's economic plans with a \"two-track\" strategy: first passing a landmark bipartisan infrastructure bill and then a larger social spending and climate package, known as the Build Back Better agenda, that Democrats planned to pass along party lines in the Senate.",

    "\"Despite some sensational coverage, it's simple: I'm giving a speech about supporting President Biden and his Build Back Better agenda for the people,\" Tlaib tweeted.",
    "As of Tuesday morning, three Democratic members of Congress from across the ideological spectrum will also give their own speeches after Biden's State of the Union.",
    "\"Democrats giving a response to democratic President SOTU…priceless,\" Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, a vulnerable moderate Democrat, tweeted on Tuesday morning.",
    "Tlaib denied that her message would be confrontational or critical of Biden himself and Axios suggested she would instead criticize Manchin — if anyone.",
