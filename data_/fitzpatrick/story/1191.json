    "“They’ve created a new paradigm of how to create an art exhibition.”\nWith a soundtrack of music that the artist listened to — Diana Ross’s rendition of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough”; “(They Long to Be) Close to You” by the Carpenters — the show has recreated Basquiat’s important physical spaces: his family’s dining room in Boerum Hill (with original spice rack and wooden fish platter); his painting studio at 57 Great Jones Street (with stacks of his books, a pair of his wine glasses); the Michael Todd VIP Room of the Palladium — complete with mirrors, draped beads and candelabras — where Basquiat spent many evenings.",
    "“To walk people through that in a way that felt right and good to us.”\nThe women, who run the estate with their stepmother, Nora Fitzpatrick, served as the show’s curators and executive producers, from the songs heard on the speakers in the Todd Room to the wall text — motivated by a desire to gather all of this material in one place, and to flesh out the picture of their brother that has often been mythologized.",
    "In a grainy home movie from 1968 — well before he had started on the path that led him to art world fame and an untimely death — an 8-year-old Jean-Michel Basquiat, dressed smartly in long shorts and a button-down shirt, gently guides his year-old sister, Jeanine, by the hand in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, with his 4-year-old sister, Lisane, frolicking in the grass beside them.",

    "Those sisters — now 54 and 57 — have spent the last five years poring over their brother’s paintings, drawings, photographs, VHS movies, African sculpture collection, toys and memorabilia to curate a sweeping exhibition of his life and work that opens Saturday at the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Chelsea.",
    "“Gerard Basquiat adamantly denies that he ever did more than spank his son with a belt.”\nThe catalog occasionally deals with the darker aspects of Basquiat’s history, describing how his parents — Gerard, a Haitian immigrant, and Matilde, a Brooklyn-born artist of Puerto Rican descent, separated.",
    "“The life story of Jean-Michel and the family story are totally integrated with the presentation of the artworks, and it gives you such deeper insight into how the work was created, how it was inspired.”\n“It’s not a professional academic presentation, but that’s what’s so fresh,” Deitch added.",
    "Jeanine’s daughter Sophia came up with the name of the show, inspired by the title of a 1987 Basquiat painting (featuring the artist’s recurring crown motif) — and the jazz vocalist whose 1952 hit, “Moody’s Mood for Love,” was a favorite of Basquiat’s father, Gerard.",
