    "“This contract protects our patients, provides safe staffing, and guarantees fair wages and benefits for every Alliance member.”\n32,000 NURSES at Kaiser Permanente going on strike\npic.twitter.com/OxYdr7P01G\n— Michelle (@mrntweet3) November 7, 2021\nUnsurprisingly, the American Hospital Association (AHA) used the February 10 hearing to ask Sen. Baldwin and Sen. Hickenlooper for more foreign nurses:\nOur workforce challenges are a national emergency that demand immediate attention from all levels of government and workable solutions.",
    "Instead, in 58th place, the AHA merely calls for legislators to “Address nursing shortages and burnout by reauthorizing nursing workforce development programs to support recruitment, retention and advanced education for nurses and other allied health professionals.”\nRep. Cole’s May 2020 bill was also backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Koch political network, both of which routinely champion the inflow of more workers, consumers, and renters.",
    "“If we are serious … We should make it easier for those without college degrees, for working parents, and for those without previous experience, to break into early-stage healthcare jobs.”\nDemocrats are hoping they can use the nurse bill and a bill that would help H-1B contract workers win the huge prize of citizenship for their children to win a critical bloc of about 12 GOP Senators for passage of a pro-migration bill.",
    "Nursing schools are “rejecting tens of thousands of qualified candidates because there aren’t enough instructors to teach them [in part because] nurse educators are paid a fraction of what they could make working clinically.”\n“If the industry — and our lawmakers — truly want to address the staffing crises, they will need to start at the root of the problem: our collective failure to value caring,” DiGregorio wrote.",
    "Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic legislators have done little to accelerate the training of American nurses for the routine nursing jobs now going to the foreign nurses favored by healthcare companies, despite the vast evidence of the sector-wide burnout and resignations caused by the coronavirus crash, and the huge share of older nurses who are heading towards retirement.",
    "On November 15, for example, Kaiser Permanente dropped plans for wage cuts after 32,000 nurses were about to strike in November, the Associated Press reported:\nAgreement on the four-year contract includes annual wage increases, while maintaining health benefits for employees, and new staffing language to continue to protect employees and patients, the statement said.",
    "“Now hospitals are having to pay incredible multiples of what they ordinarily would pay to nurses to contract with companies that basically will provide the [travel] nurses.”\nThe foreign nurses should get U.S. nursing jobs because not enough Americans are interested in nursing careers, said a statement from Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK).",
    "pic.twitter.com/fSTjV0eJJG\n— More Perfect Union (@MorePerfectUS) October 1, 2021\nHospital managers burn through their nursing workforce, regardless of the damage done to nurses and patients, DiGregorio wrote:\nEmploying more nurses per patient is safer for patients, and it makes nurses less likely to burn-out and quit.",
    "The Hechinger Report outlined the federal failure in December:\nLONG BEACH, Calif. — At a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed a growing shortage of nurses, it should have been good news that there were more than 1,200 applicants to enter the associate degree program in nursing at Long Beach City College.",
    "“At the same time, there are eligible students who are turned away from potential training because of the shortage of nursing faculty.”\n“Just in Colorado, we’re facing an estimated shortage of 10,000 nurses over the next five years,” Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) said.",
    "“The number of Americans interested in pursuing health care professions has unfortunately not kept pace with the growing demand … [so] allowing skilled, foreign medical professionals to practice in the U.S. is a suitable alternative,” Cole’s statement said.",
    "I miss her a lot and also my mom.”\nIn 1996, healthcare lobbyists persuaded Congress to create a hidden pipeline for hospitals to import their own nurses and therapists, similar to the special H-1B white-collar pipeline created for the Fortune 500.",
    "“We’re going to test that.”\nFor now, 13 GOP Senators — and at least 12 Democrat Senators — are sponsoring the new bill that would import at least 25,000 foreign nurses for stable careers that would otherwise go to young Americans.",
    "pic.twitter.com/oKhiugIhyv\n— Improve The Dream (@ImproveTheDream) March 18, 2022\n“The question is: is there anything we can do on the subject of immigration that can win 60 votes in the Senate?” Durbin asked Politico on March 20.",

    "“While I wish more Americans were choosing to pursue education and professions in the health care field, the reality is that our country has a serious labor shortage and simply cannot fulfill the demand,” he said.",

    "U.S. universities and colleges last year rejected 80,407 qualified applicants for bachelor’s and graduate degrees in nursing, blaming a lack of faculty, classroom space and clinical opportunities in hospitals.",
