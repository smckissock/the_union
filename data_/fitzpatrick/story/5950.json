    "But it’s all good, because Powell – the 6-foot-3 wing with the 6-11 wingspan – is thrilled to have been rerouted back to L.A.\n“Just being able to be around my family,” he said after scoring 28 points on 9-for-16 shooting, including going 4 for 8 from 3-point range and 6 for 7 from the line to tip off his tenure with his third NBA team following time in Toronto and, most recently, Portland.",
    "I love to watch the guys who I look up to and pick up different things from them, so just the preparation that they had and their focus, going out there each and every night and giving themselves up for the team.”\nNow Powell is the player who has arrived to help infuse those unselfish, detail-oriented traits to the Clippers’ quest for their first ring.",
    "LOS ANGELES — Much as Norman Powell displayed his veritable points-producing prowess on Sunday – stepping back or into 3-pointers, slipping right past Giannis Antetokounmpo once and then doing it again past a trio of Bucks defenders, lofting a floater, drawing fouls, feeding teammates – he flashed his grin after his Clippers debut.",
    "“I think we have something really good here and I’m just looking to come in and help any way I can – and hopefully bring a championship here.”\nCLIPPERS (27-28) at GRIZZLIES (37-18)\nWhen: Tuesday, 5 p.m.\nWhere: FedExForum, Memphis\nTV/Radio: Bally Sports SoCal / 570 AM\nWhat's going on with the Clippers?",
    "“When we first got Serge, how detailed he was in his preparation, taking care of his body, doing all the extra little things to make sure he goes out there and he’s 100% perfect,” Powell said of the veteran center, their Toronto tenures having overlapped for four seasons.",
    "It seems like it’s bigger than basketball, being home and having my family be able to come to a lot more games.”\nHis familiarity with his new surroundings isn’t only geographic and personal – he’s also got strong business ties with several of his colleagues.",
    "Here is, of course, Robert Covington, who arrived with Powell from Portland in Friday’s trade, which sent Eric Bledsoe, Justise Winslow, Keon Johnson and a second-round pick to the Trail Blazers.",
    "“And when we got Kawhi and Danny (Green), just seeing the focus and what it takes to win a championship,” Powell said, alluding to their championship experience with the San Antonio Spurs.",
    "Even the Clippers’ ebullient assistant coach Jeremy Castleberry offers a personal connection, having hosted Powell on his official visit to San Diego State when he was in high school.",
    "Then a fourth-year pro, Powell averaged 15.9 minutes per game during that successful playoff run, chipping in with 6.5 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.",
    "It felt more intense, so as a guy still feeling out and trying to make my way behind those guys and see where I fit in, I was just picking up the little things.",
    "Like the buckets, Powell’s smile – a winning one, despite the 137-113 loss to the red-hot reigning NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks – came early and it came often.",
    "“Me and my friends when I was in high school used to talk about coming up to the Staples Center then – Crypto now – playing in front of the fans here.",
    "And Daniel Fitzpatrick – or, as Powell called him, “Fitz, the video guy” – who was the Bruins’ basketball manager during Powell’s time in Westwood.",

    "Little things they would talk about throughout the training camp and games, what they’re focused on and just their preparation.",
    "And Wes Long – the Clippers’ assistant strength and conditioning coach – held a similar role at UCLA when Powell played there.",
    "A 28-year-old San Diego native who starred as a high-flying defensive stopper at UCLA, he wasn’t expecting to be traded.",
    "Powell said he learned plenty from Leonard and Ibaka about how to be a professional – and how to become a champion.",
    "But here also includes Paul George and Reggie Jackson, with whom he’s spent time in past summers.",
