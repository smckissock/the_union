    "There’s no way Garoppolo could be worth all that trouble — and it’s a whole lot of trouble — for new head coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler, who already enter a tense situation following Jon Gruden’s resignation, a season of tumult with off-the-field incidents, and many Raiders players wanting interim head coach Rich Bisaccia to be retained.",
    "The Broncos are in a spot where Garoppolo could make a ton of sense — new head coach Nathanial Hackett was just the offensive coordinator of Green Bay’s Kyle Shanahan system — but I think they’re going for a significant upgrade at the quarterback position this offseason and Garoppolo does not provide that level of change over Teddy Bridgewater.",
    "No sir, not going to happen: Indianapolis Colts +1400, Cleveland Browns +1200, Green Bay Packers +1000\nI can understand why the Colts and Browns would be interested in Garoppolo — their quarterbacks are on-par or worse than Jimmy G and don’t carry nearly as much off-field value.",
    "If Niners’ offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel is hired for this gig, there’s an increased chance that Garoppolo could come to town — what a wonderful fit that could be — but the Dolphins don’t seem particularly motivated to make a quarterback move this season.",
    "Garoppolo isn’t on the same level as Minkah Fitzpatrick, but in 2019 the Steelers sent a first-round pick to Miami in-season for the safety, all so they could make the playoffs with Rudolph and Duck Hodges playing quarterback.",
    "Can’t rule them out: Carolina Panthers +700, Miami Dolphins +700\nThe Panthers should be with the Browns and Colts here — they just gave up a second-round draft pick and picked up Sam Darnold’s fifth-year option.",
    "Bad timing: Houston Texans +1000, Denver Broncos +600\nTexans general manager Nick Caserio knows Garoppolo from their time in New England, but I simply don’t think they’re trying to win anytime soon in Houston.",
    "Add in the fact that Garoppolo grew up a Bears fan with disdain for the Packers and Green Bay has former first-round pick Jordan Love on a rookie deal and Garoppolo to Green Bay makes zero sense.",
    "I don’t think Garoppolo would be thrilled with this landing spot, but Washington needs a new quarterback, preferably a veteran with a winning pedigree, and a new face for their rebrand, too.",
    "The Niners had four head coaches in four years filled with controversy, chaos and a whole lot of losing football before Garoppolo showed up via the Patriots in a Halloween 2017 trade.",
    "The Niners and Washington worked out a trade for Trent Williams two years ago — the relationship between the two organizations isn’t as bad as Kyle Shanahan would want you to believe.",
    "But to get to the point where they would be trading for Jimmy G, they’d have to move on from Derek Carr, a quarterback who occupies the same limbo in the NFL’s quarterback hierarchy.",
    "The Steelers are in win-now mode and they were just able to make the playoffs with Ben Roethlisberger embarrassing himself with passes that made Garoppolo look like Patrick Mahomes.",
    "Yes, Pittsburgh could go with Roethlisberger’s backup, Mason Rudolph, at quarterback, but they would be fools to waste a year of their great defense with that nonsense.",
    "Garoppolo would be a clear upgrade in Charlotte and there’s serious desperation there, but it’s still too bold to think it’s anything more than a fringe possibility.",
    "Wentz has a $15 million dead cap hit if the Colts cut him (no one is going to trade for him) and Mayfield already had his fifth-year option picked up by the Browns.",
    "He doesn’t have any official say in the matter — his no-trade clause will expire in a few weeks — but it’s good the 49ers are giving him input into the process.",
    "If Arians decides he’s willing to tweak the offense — a big if — or if he sees something in Garoppolo the rest of the league doesn’t, this is a great fit.",
    "That said, Garoppolo might be the best truly available quarterback on the market and the Buccaneers are a top NFC team that plays in a terrible division.",
    "It’s a departure from California, but his hometown of Chicago and Pittsburgh are kindred spirits of cities — there should be no cultural issues at all.",
    "Ultimately, it’s terribly challenging to imagine how either the Colts or Browns move on from Carson Wentz or Mayfield with their current contracts.",
    "They might be willing to move on from Jimmy G, but they’re not interested in ever meeting him in a playoff game that’s not the Super Bowl.",
    "I’d bet Washington will offer the most competitive draft-pick package for Jimmy G in what might not be a terribly competitive market.",
    "Sleeper: Tampa Bay Buccaneers +550\nThe reason the Buccaneers would not go for Garoppolo is his inability to throw the deep ball.",
    "Giving up serious draft capital (and contract money) for a veteran quarterback doesn’t seem ideal for that team at the moment.",
    "You can view Garoppolo as a clear upgrade to Tua Tagovailoa — I do — but will general manager Chris Grier feel the same way?",
    "Don’t you wish you still had that no-trade clause: Washington Commanders +400\nDid I just give away the new team name?",
    "But, more importantly, the 49ers are not going to trade Garoppolo to arguably their top non-divisional NFC rival.",
    "“You look back on it and just how far this team, this organization has come in four years, it’s pretty wild.",
    "The favorites: Pittsburgh Steelers +300\nIt makes all the sense in the world for all parties involved.",
    "Plus, if Garoppolo does, indeed, have a say over his next destination, he’ll say no to Houston.",
    "You have to go big in the AFC West and consolation prizes aren’t going to play in that market.",
    "Will either team do the incredible amount of work necessary to get that marginal improvement?",
    "He said Tuesday that he and the 49ers have already discussed possible trade destinations.",
    "Chaos agents: Las Vegas Raiders +1200\nThe new guard in the desert comes from New England.",
    "The Niners might not like having Garoppolo in the NFC, but they aren’t above a good deal.",
    "For Garoppolo, being the face of another premier, national NFL franchise would be easy.",
    "Garoppolo would be going to a great organization but he’d also be out of conference.",
    "Garoppolo is going to leave the 49ers this offseason, most likely via another trade.",
    "But Darnold was so bad last year that they might just pivot off him this offseason.",
    "Pittsburgh has also shown serious aggressiveness with trading for proven players.",
    "But make no mistake about it, he has left the Niners better than he found them.",
    "Jimmy Garoppolo came to the 49ers when the organization was in dire straits.",
    "Some are crazy long shots that would require NFL chaos to truly be involved.",
    "He took over a team that had a 1-10 record in Kyle Shanahan’s first season.",
    "As for the Packers: is Aaron Rodgers actually going to leave Green Bay?",
    "But I wouldn’t change anything for the world.”\nAll class, right there.",
    "For the Niners, it’s an easy win if the offered compensation is close.",
    "I think he’d make them one of the better teams in the NFL again, too.",
    "Per Oddschecker.com, there are 11 teams in the running for Garoppolo.",
    "“It’s always something I’ve tried to live,” Garoppolo said Tuesday.",
    "I don’t know how they feel about Garoppolo, but the tie is there.",
    "This is bad timing and bad optics — I don’t like the combination.",
    "(Unless we’re counting Baker Mayfield’s commercials, of course.)",
    "Let’s break them down, one by one, from least likely to most.",
    "Whether or not Garoppolo likes it is somewhat irrelevant.",
    "No team in the NFL embodies that more than the Steelers.",
    "Garoppolo has no problem following Tom Brady, either.",
    "I’d be stunned if Pittsburgh isn’t the landing spot.",
    "That desperation is just enough to keep them in it.",
    "Deshaun Watson is still, technically, on the team.",
    "That’s the backbone of any Bruce Arians offense.",
    "The Bucs are in a position to make a huge offer.",
    "He won five straight games to end that season.",
    "A few others make all the sense in the world.",
    "Plus, the Niners fleeced them in that deal.",
    "Where will the 2022 season find Garoppolo?",
    "He won 30 more over the next four.",
    "Davis Mills was fine last season.",
    "I have serious doubts about that.",
    "Garoppolo says he values winning.",
    "It all seems too bold, too soon.",
    "Would Garoppolo be an upgrade?",
    "Why not go back to the well?",
    "Who better than Garoppolo?",
    "I seriously doubt it.",
    "But change is coming.",
    "He deserved that.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "Oops.",
    "Sure.",
    "Nope."
