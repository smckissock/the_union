    "Scottie Scheffler, with wins in three of his last five starts, will take to the final group on Saturday with a five-shot lead over the field, after what was a fraught and difficult day that tightened the chasing pack heading into the weekend, but left one man standing above the rest.",
    "Recommended\nScheffler, who was playing in the final group and will be doing so again on Saturday, made a patient start after bogeying the first but inspired play after the turn moved him to a score of -8 that did not look reachable earlier.",
    "For a player who came into the week in such promising form and who appeared to master the greens in between his first and last holes on Thursday, such a round was unexpected, even if he did get back to -2 with improved play later on.",
    "Charl Schwartzel, Shane Lowry and Hideki Matsuyama rose, and amongst it all Tiger Woods battled on to ensure that he made the cut – which remains as remarkable a story as any that will be produced at this opening major of the year.",

    "Matsuyama’s control of Augusta from last year appeared to be continuing and the defending champion hitting the front seemed to be an ominous sign for the rest of the field, although Scheffler was unmoved.",
    "After a bogey at the first left him at +2, he quietly got to work down the front nine before a chip-in for birdie at the 10th to move him into the red ensured he could not slip under the radar any longer.",
    "The response to that adversity was just as impressive to his previous round of 71, as he made consecutive birdies at the 13th and 14th to pull himself back and continue his remarkable story.",
    "Dropped shots at the 10th and 12th were rescued by sensational birdies at the 13th and 16th, but even they were sandwiched between finding the water for a bogey-six at the par-5 15th.",
    "Many were unable to keep with the pace, especially those caught by the worst of the conditions, as Scheffler pulled away with a string of birdies on his final holes.",
    "As the wind swirled around Augusta and the low scores dried up in the gusts, the world No 1 emerged to find the birdies required to seize control of The Masters.",
    "For a moment, three former Masters winners shared the lead as defending champion Hideki Matsuyama joined Schwartzel and Willett, but it would not last for long.",
    "Sungjae Im, the overnight leader at -5, made it there at level par for the day, recovering from an opening bogey, but his back nine would be an eventful ride.",
    "It was thought a round of level par would have kept plenty of those in the field in contention – but that was before Scheffler’s magnificent back nine.",
    "A testing uphill putt on the lightning 11th green saved par before he drilled his approach to within 12 feet of the hole at the 12th to set up birdie.",
    "That was also where McIlroy met his undoing, a double-bogey six puncturing his chances, before he played out his round under par to finish +2 overall.",
    "He also picked up shots at the par-5s, before a brilliant birdie at 16 made a mockery of the earlier difficulties experienced throughout the course.",
    "Johnson held it together on the back nine with a string of pars to remain firmly in contention at -2, or so it seemed based on those early scores.",
    "In stepped Willett, the 2016 Masters champion on the hunt for another taste of victory at Augusta, who birdied the 2nd to take the outright lead.",
    "Collin Morikawa looked to have been heating up as he hit the turn with consecutive birdies to get into the red for the first time this week.",
    "McIlroy faltered and Johnson had a little mid-round crisis around the turn, which is where the wind was swirling and gusting with menace.",
    "Smith bogeyed the 1st, an improvement on his double bogey there yesterday, but a second bogey at the 4th saw him relinquish the lead.",
    "The American rounded the front nine with a pair of birdies to hit the front and when the pressure moments came he held his nerve.",
    "Another followed at the 13th after finding his ball amongst the photographers on his approach, only to get up and down in two.",
    "Earlier, Dustin Johnson was purring as his tee shot at the par-3 4th landed within six feet to move within a shot of the lead.",
    "There were moments where it looked like Woods, after the exertions of Thursday’s stunning return, would fall away completely.",
    "As McIlroy took a long stare at the flag at the third after it changed direction, it was clear Augusta was baring its teeth.",
    "WIllett landed in trouble with his approach at 10 before the 11th found another victim, his putt running through the green.",
    "As Im held the lead at -3 it opened up the competition to even those who started the day in the positive figures.",
    "Recommended\nHe was thriving in his status as the world No 1, just as Lowry was also beginning to have some fun.",
