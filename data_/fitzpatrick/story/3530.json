    "Susan Davidson\nMadison, Wis.\nImperial Tongues\nTo the Editor:\nIn a letter (Feb. 27) responding to Amy Chua’s review of Rosemary Salomane’s “The Rise of English,” Kibbe Fitzpatrick still searches “for the answer to why English could win a battle that Sanskrit, Greek and Latin could not come close to achieving.”\nYou don’t suppose the English-speaking British Empire — which covered about 25 percent of the world’s land mass at its peak — could have had anything to do with this, do you?",
    "While the index includes entries for “Prohibition,” “prostitution” and “Mafia, the,” there isn’t one for “speakeasy,” even though my grandfather worked at such a “gentlemen’s club” across the street from the State Legislature; so under this category, the indexer could have indicated, “see New York State Capitol.”\nMichael Wilpers\nSilver Spring, Md.",
    "Wayne Scott\nPortland, Ore.\nIndexing Humor\nTo the Editor:\nMargalit Fox’s review of Dennis Duncan’s “Index, A History of the” (Feb. 27) reminded me of an entry in the index for William Kennedy’s “O Albany!” When it came out, I looked to see if my great-grandfather’s ice house was listed under the W’s.",
    "In perusing the index late one night, one of my colleagues came upon the following entry: “Chauvinism, male, voluminous amounts 1-1,102.” We also discovered “Eyes, of Texas are upon you, 1-1,102.” We all loved this commentary and came to refer to it as the revenge of the mad indexer.",
    "It wasn’t — but I was amused to see a nearby entry for “vote fraud” where, rather than provide the page numbers, the indexer indicated, “see Democratic Party.” I’d never thought that an indexer could both editorialize and entertain.",
    "Paula Burke Campbell\nWashington, D.C.\nGenre Bias\nTo the Editor:\nRegarding Becca Rothfeld’s review of Rebecca Mead’s “Home/Land: A Memoir of Departure and Return” (March 6): I was so excited when I saw an issue devoted to memoir.",
    "Lack of Focus\nTo the Editor:\nI am treading carefully regarding Amy Bloom’s powerful memoir “In Love” (March 6), about her husband’s Alzheimer’s and euthanasia, and the details highlighted in Alex Witchel’s review.",
    "Citing Bloom’s husband’s declining interest in his wardrobe and her television script seems perhaps unfair given the bigger picture of his prognosis and an impossibly difficult decision for both.",
    "I tried to imagine a reviewer who bemoaned the tedium of having to read any novel, or any book of poetry, before launching into her snooty tirade against a specific example.",
    "The authoritative text at that time was a 1,179-page tome: “Williams Obstetrics, 16th Edition” (1980).",
    "Martin Wilson\nFernandina Beach, Fla.\nbooks@nytimes.com\nThe Times welcomes letters from readers.",
    "Why, in 2022, is it still fair game to trot out all the old, worn prejudices against memoirs?",
    "A Sublime Sketch\nTo the Editor:\nRegarding “Day Jobs,” by Paul Karasik (Feb. 27): Brilliant!",
    "To the Editor:\nI was a resident physician in obstetrics and gynecology from 1982 to 1986.",
    "Letters for publication should include the writer’s name, address and telephone number.",
    "But why would you select a reviewer who clearly has contempt for the whole genre?",
    "Don’t invite these bullies to play on our part of the literary playground.",
    "The authors were faculty at the renowned Parkland Hospital in Dallas.",
    "(My husband had more age-appropriate Alzheimer’s.)",
    "Were the indexer and proofreader in collusion?",
    "Letters may be edited for length and clarity.",
    "We were expected to know every bit of it.",
    "The email address is books@\nnytimes.com.",
    "“Embarrassing indulgences”?",
    "Elaine Cioffi\nParamus, N.J.",
    "It would never happen.",
    "“Reviled species”?",
    "Just wondering.",
