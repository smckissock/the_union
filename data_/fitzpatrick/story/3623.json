    "There will always be the caveat of “Well, doesn’t that mean that Winston needs to be in the right system to thrive?” However, that’s the same question that Garoppolo, Matthew Stafford, Kirk Cousins, and dozens more quarterbacks that people consider “starting-caliber” have faced.",
    "Where Garoppolo’s early success with San Francisco can largely be attributed to a lack of game film on the former New England backup as well as a lack of expectations with him joining one of the worst teams in the league at the time, Winston didn’t have that luxury.",
    "While Winston has always denied the claims from his accuser, Erica Kinsman, and ultimately no charges were pressed on the former Heisman winner due to “lack of evidence, Kinsman remains adamant that Winston did not face proper justice.",
    "When given a great receiving corps, an elite outside zone run scheme, a great offensive line, a brilliant offensive-minded head coach, and a great defense, he helped lead the 49ers to two NFC Championship Games and a Super Bowl.",
    "There were obviously some concerns with his lack of yardage (167.1 yards per game — lowest of his career) and completion percentage (59 percent), but those issues were trivial in the face of what Winston finally did right.",
    "Winston put up career-highs in TD percentage (8.7 percent), INT percentage (1.9 percent), TD-INT ratio (14-3, or 4.67-to-1), adjusted yards gained per pass attempt (8.2), and passer rating (102.8).",
    "Sure, no team seriously wants Ryan Fitzpatrick or Andy Dalton to be their franchise quarterback, but there is someone, untethered to any one team right now who not enough people are looking at.",
    "In his final three seasons with Tampa Bay, Winston finished 10th, ninth, and 14th in Expected Points Added per play (basically a measure of a quarterback’s explosiveness and efficiency).",
    "The lawsuit was settled in 2016 after the case had been “resolved to the satisfaction of the parties.”\nWould signing Winston with the intent of him becoming a franchise starter be risky?",
    "Sure, Winston never reached the heights Garoppolo did, but he also brings much more to the table in terms of arm talent and could likely be signed to a much cheaper deal.",
    "Of course there are reasons why teams may look to avoid Winston altogether, the most obvious of which being his rape accusation while attending Florida State University.",
    "Garoppolo went 5-0 in all fairness, and was in a worse situation when he joined the 49ers than Winston when he joined the Saints, but the similarities are still there.",
    "He wasn’t good with Tampa Bay, but in his first year as the starter in New Orleans, he proved he was capable of winning games, even in a division with Tom Brady.",
    "But when Winston finally figures out how to limit his turnover factor and leads a subpar offense to a 5-2 record, he gets tossed aside without a second thought?",
    "Everyone lauded Winstons’ deep ball in Tampa Bay, and now that he has ball security seemingly under control, he could be the mother of all sleeper free agents.",
    "Keep in mind that several teams seem to be interested in 49ers’ quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo because he was able to win games in the right circumstance.",
    "Maybe, but it’s one more game (and two more games started) that Garoppolo had with the 49ers before they offered him his enormous contract extension.",
    "Teams knew exactly what Winston brought to the table, yet Winston still blew expectations away with his improved decision-making and ball security.",
    "Yet, despite the obvious lack of elite quarterback talent across the league, most NFL rumors center around teams trading for other teams’ starters.",
    "The man literally had surgery performed on his throwing shoulder recently, but when placed in a perfect situation, he can win games.",
    "Jameis Winston may have only played in seven games last season, but it was arguably the most successful season of his career.",
    "Four years, $200 million (supposedly), and one fewer team questioning their future at the quarterback position.",
    "Winston was a turnover machine, who was best remembered as a meme than actual starting-caliber NFL quarterback.",
    "He did all that while throwing to an “elite” receiving corps of Marquez Callaway and Deonte Harris.",
    "Then there’s Washington, Philadelphia, the New York Giants, Indy, Tampa, blah blah blah blah blah.",
    "Hell yes, but it wouldn’t be expensive, and would, at the worst, be a one-year rental.",
    "Is seven games too small a sample size to judge Winston’s success with the Saints on?",
    "That’s a big get for a team in a division with Patrick Mahomes and Justin Herbert.",
    "It seems his year under Drew Brees may have had a remarkable effect on him.",
    "For years, all people could talk about was Winston’s lack of ball security.",
    "With Rodgers back in Green Bay, should Minnesota trade away Kirk Cousins?",
    "Still, there are several teams that don’t know what they’re going to do.",
    "So, Aaron Rodgers duped us all into thinking he was done with Green Bay.",
    "In his lone year as the starter in New Orleans, he finished second.",
    "Much like Winston, Garoppolo brings injury concerns to the table.",
    "Denver has their whole situation figured out as well I guess.",
    "More QB-needy teams need to start giving Winston a look.",
    "Almost none deal with actual free agent QBs though.",
    "Winston actually brings more to the table though.",
    "So many teams, so few quarterbacks to go around.",
    "Will the Texans actually trade Watson this year?",
    "Winston is essentially in the same situation.",
    "Fine numbers, nothing flashy, but solid.",
    "Why is it only an issue with Winston?",
    "What’s Pittsburgh going to do?",
    "What about Carolina?",
    "Russell Wilson?",
    "I don’t get it."
