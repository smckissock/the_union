    "As has been the case for years, Fitzpatrick works best as a one-season rental, either as a top backup or emergency starter.”\nWhy Fitzpatrick Is a ‘Logical’ Option for Bucs\nFitzpatrick missed essentially the entire 2021 season after signing with Washington last offseason.",
    "Gabbert Could Emerge as Bucs’ Starting QB\nAccording to a February 22 story from Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times, the Bucs might avoid going with Trask or a free agent and instead go with Blaine Gabbert.",
    "But considering his veteran experience — he has started 48 games during his career — and his familiarity with Arians’ offense, he may emerge as the dark-horse candidate to start for the Buccaneers in 2022.",
    "Gabbert, 32, has spent four seasons in Bruce Arians’ system — including the 2017 season with the Arizona Cardinals — and taught Brady the offense upon his arrival in 2020.",
    "With the retirement of Tom Brady, the only Buccaneers quarterback under contract is Kyle Trask, a 2021 second-round draft selection who never took a snap last season.",
    "With the top free agent quarterbacks being Jameis Winston and Teddy Bridgewater, according to Pro Football Focus, the number of top-tier options is at a minimum.",
    "“Approaching his age-40 season, it’s unclear if Fitzpatrick will even return for an 18th season, especially after suffering a serious hip injury early in 2021.",
    "For all his colorful character and big-play mentality, though, Fitz hasn’t stayed healthy for a full season since 2015, when he started for the Jets.",
    "In his 10 starts as a Buccaneer, Fitzpatrick went 4-6 and threw 24 touchdowns against 15 interceptions with a 94.7 quarterback rating.",
    "If he does, he at least offers entertainment value, bringing ageless gunslinging and spot-starting experience to the table.",
    "In his February 21 piece, Benjamin described the value Fitzpatrick could bring to the table entering his age-40 season.",
    "But CBS Sports’ Cody Benjamin suggested another familiar face — Ryan Fitzpatrick — as a “logical” fit for Tampa Bay.",
    "He also led the league with 9.6 yards per pass attempt and 14.4 yards per pass completion during the 2018 campaign.",
    "After spending 2021 with the Washington Football Team, Fitzpatrick is expected to become a free agent in March.",
    "He’s a gritty veteran capable of leading a team to victories in short spurts, but he’s not a long-term option.",
    "Benjamin suggested Fitzpatrick likely will command a market value between $3 million and $7 million a year.",
    "Entering the 2022 offseason, the Buccaneers will have a little under $7 million available in cap space.",
    "So, it’s likely that Tampa Bay will look to the free agent and trade markets for a veteran quarterback.",
    "If the Buccaneers pursue Winston or Bridgewater and fail, Fitzpatrick could be a nice fallback option.",
    "As Fitzpatrick enters what would be his 18th season, you know what you’re going to get out of him.",
    "His only notable playing time came in mop-up duty during a 2020 game versus the Detroit Lions.",
    "Bruce Arians' Buccaneers could pursue 39-year-old quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick in free agency.",
    "Most importantly, he could push Trask, 23, during training camp and serve as his mentor.",
    "Fitzpatrick, 39, played for the Buccaneers in 2017 and 2018 as Jameis Winston’s backup.",
    "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be on the hunt for a new quarterback this offseason.",
    "He has seen minimal playing time in Tampa Bay since joining the team in 2019.",
    "A hip injury in the season opener forced him to miss the rest of the season.",
    "He’s played for nine different teams and has never led one to the playoffs.",
    "In fact, he hasn’t started a game since the 2018 season.",
    "The Bucs could target either one of those quarterbacks.",
    "He’s also always been prone to turnover sprees.",
