    "Carter II told Brandin Echols to expect a quick throw to Hunder’s hitch route from Tua Tagovailoa, who is known for getting the ball out quickly – Tagovailoa’s average time to throw was 2.53, third fastest in the NFL.",
    "Having a young man have success and to watch him grow.”\nYOUTH IN THE ROOM\nComing into the season, the cornerbacks unit’s experience and talent were questioned by fans, media and some within the Jets building.",
    "Normally, a quick throw would be to the offense’s benefit, but when there is a cornerback who knows exactly what’s coming, it leaves very little time to make late-breaking adjustments.",

    "But Ashytn Davis lounged at Breida and Davis’ arm jarred the football out and it flung towards C.J Mosley, who stuck his hand out which caused the ball to pop up in the air.",
    "Absent a veteran stud or transcendent rookie, Oden did not have the luxury of allowing his young charges to pick up on good habits by observing all-pro teammates.",
    "But Carter II jumped up and slapped the ball out of Moose’s possession and landed in front of Sharrod Neasman’s feet before ricocheting off of Neasman’s cleats.",
    "Echols registered a solid rookie season as he snagged two interceptions, second most among rookies, and QBs had a passer rating of 80 when targeting Echols.",

    "The cornerback room never discussed the pervasive doubt about their ability amongst themselves, but used it as motivation throughout the season.",

    "EXPERIENCE BEYOND YEARS\nA lot of work went into the Jets corners arriving at those eureka moments and it started early.",
    "It wasn’t his play to make but he fought his butt off.”\nAnd Week 10 against the Bills encapsulated Oden’s teachings.",
