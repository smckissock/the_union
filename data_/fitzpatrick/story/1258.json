    "Bills May Have Other Options\nThough the Bills have prioritized other positions since the start of free agency — especially defensive line, where they added All-Pro edge rusher Von Miller — general manager Brandon Beane has hinted that there will still be more additions to come through the draft.",
    "We don’t play games until September, so it’s my job to make sure we have the roster ready by then.”\nTre’Davious White was the first to coin the term, but with a restrictive cap #Bills GM Brandon Beane is living up Tre’s “Big Baller Beane” moniker more than ever this offseason.",
    "Eagles CB Steve @Nelson_Island with his first INT since picking off Carson Wentz twice last year in Pittsburgh\n— John Clark (@JClarkNBCS) October 11, 2021\nBallentine said Nelson could be a cheap addition for a team in need of a No.",
    "As Jay Skurski of the Buffalo News pointed out, they could release linebacker and special teams ace Tyler Matakevich to free up $2.5 million, and could get another $2.5 million with a simple restructuring of Josh Allen’s contract.",
    "Early in the last offseason, reports indicated that the Bills were among a group of teams interested in former Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Steve Nelson as they looked to add some depth behind Tre’Davious White.",
    "Now, with White rebabbing a torn ACL and potentially missing some of the start of the season, Buffalo’s need for help in the secondary is even greater, and they could have another chance at Nelson.",
    "Nelson Could Bring Strong Value\nWhile the Bills have brought in help at a number of positions, they have not yet made any additions in the secondary, even after losing Levi Wallace in free agency.",
    "In his first season in Pittsburgh, he was lights-out, giving up no touchdowns and a passer rating of 65.8 when targeted while playing 99 percent of the defensive snaps,” Ballentine noted.",
    "pic.twitter.com/lNKREWk7OS\nThere could be some moves Beane can make to gain more cap space and potentially create room for another cornerback, whether it be Nelson or another veteran.",
    "They could have a chance with Nelson, who Bleacher Report’s Alex Ballentine identified as one of the most underrated free agents still on the market.",
    "Over the last two seasons, Nelson has given up 12 touchdowns and more than 1,300 yards, he noted, but could be ripe for a bounce-back season.",
    "Free agency could also be an option, though Beane noted that the team doesn’t have the cap space to make any moves right now.",
    "Ballentine noted that Nelson had a rough season with the Eagles and wasn’t much better with the Steelers the previous year.",
    "We’re not just waking up every day, going `where’s the corner?’ We’re looking everywhere, and we’ve got a lot of time.",
    "The Buffalo Bills could get a second chance to land the veteran cornerback that got away last year.",
    "It’s well-worth the gamble to give him a one-year deal, as he can still be a No.",
    "Steve Nelson reacts to a play in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs.",
    "“We’ve got a lot of positions that I still want to get more depth.",
    "“My main focus right now is just the [NFL] Draft,” Beane said.",
    "2 outside corner and might return to peak form,” he wrote.",
    "2 cornerback, which would fit the needs for the Bills.",
    "“We’re out of money, unless you guys have some here.",
    "So yeah, other than that, I mean, we’ll always look.",
    "“He’s capable of playing much better, though.",
    "The latest Bills news straight to your inbox!",
    "Join the Heavy on Bills newsletter here!",
    "Like, you know, we’re never satisfied.",
    "After the draft, we’ll be looking.",
    "We’re always looking.",
