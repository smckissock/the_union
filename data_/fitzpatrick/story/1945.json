    "The Bills tendered Bates at the low level of $2.433 million, which gives them only the right of first refusal.”\n#Bears are hopeful that by Tuesday, they'll have added O-lineman Ryan Bates, a restricted free agent whom Bills could retain by matching Bears' offer sheet.",

    "As Biggs noted, the offer from Chicago could be a bit of a stretch given the light resume for Bates and the Bears’ need for upgrades to the offensive line.",
    "Bills Expected to Decline Offer Sheet\nAs Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune reported, the Bills could be hard-pressed to match the Bears’ offer for Bates.",
    "The Bills tendered the lineman at the lowest level, meaning Chicago will not have to send a draft pick to Buffalo if he ends up signing there.",
