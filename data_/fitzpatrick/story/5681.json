    ": NFL app // Yahoo Sports app: https://t.co/EMdqIO97si pic.twitter.com/yaMXpsNQID\n— NFL (@NFL) January 3, 2021\nAs Nick Fierro of SI.com’s Bills Central added, McKenzie could be the eventual slot replacement for Cole Beasley, who turns 33 later this year and would carry a hefty $7.6 million salary-cap hit for the upcoming season.",

    "He came back this year on a $1.15 million contract with $300,000 guaranteed, but said at the time that he didn’t need any amount of money to come back.",
    "“McKenzie will turn 27 in April, is likely at the peak of his athletic career and would come much cheaper than Beasley,” Fierro wrote.",
    "McKenzie Cuts a Rug\nA fan took to Twitter on February 4 to share a video of McKenzie dressed up and dancing the salsa in a ballroom.",
