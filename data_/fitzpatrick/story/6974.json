    "• Rudolph 11/4\n• Derek Carr (Las Vegas) 7/1\n• Jimmy Garoppolo (San Francisco) 15/2\n• Jameis Winston (New Orleans) 9/1\n• Kenny Pickett (Pitt) 9/1\n• Haskins 10/1\nA pair of other veterans, Kirk Cousins and Ryan Fitzpatrick, are next at 11/1.",
    "Other potential rookies besides Pickett included Mississippi’s Matt Corral (12/1), Liberty’s Malik Willis (14/1), Cincinnati’s Desmond Ridder (15/1) and North Carolina’s Sam Howell (18/1).",
    "The best thing Rudolph has going with the fans right now is that the next best option is Haskins, and most of Pittsburgh doesn’t seem to be too excited about him either.",
    "The further this team has gotten away from being a Super Bowl contender, the clearer it has become to them that they may need to supplement some holes on their roster.",
    "If the cost of acquiring one of those three players is too high in terms of either draft picks or dollars (or both) to work out a manageable contract, then oh well.",
    "It sure feels like either of the team’s current backups — Mason Rudolph or Dwayne Haskins — will be the man under center to replace Ben Roethlisberger, though.",

    "The defense, too, by keeping that unit off the field by converting an occasional third down pass beyond the sticks.",
    "“The Steelers never do stuff like that.”\nWell, they also usually don’t trade up into the top 10 of the first round.",
    "If the likes of Rodgers, Wilson and Carr stay put or go elsewhere, I’d consider drafting Pickett or Corral.",
    "Regardless of circumstances, the whole city is going to pounce on the guy after his first interception.",
    "But if the Steelers are going to do that, just trade Rudolph and have Haskins compete with the rookie.",
    "Because I think the Steelers should be aggressive in their pursuit of one of those three quarterbacks.",
    "But, if the Steelers are outbid, I hope the highest bidding team is seriously stupid in its spending.",
    "Let’s be honest, watching Rodgers move and throw at 38 is much different than Roethlisberger’s 39.",
    "If the Rudolph-Haskins approach doesn’t work out in 2022, the Steelers could go bold in 2023.",

    "That may even be the case if they draft a quarterback in the first round.",
    "So, I’d rather replace one with another future Hall of Famer in Rodgers.",
    "I bet Wilson (33) and Rodgers (38) each have at least four years left.",
