    "Cincinnati Bengals: Kenyon Green, G, Texas A&M\nAfter quarterback Joe Burrow was sacked 19 times during a stunning Super Bowl run, the Bengals’ draft strategy should be pretty simple: “best offensive lineman available.” The 6-4, 325-pound Green projects as a standout guard, but he could fill in at tackle for a team that desperately needs to fix the right side of its line.",
    "Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Jordan Davis, DT, Georgia\nEven before quarterback Tom Brady retired, the Bucs were facing a mass exodus of players like wide receiver Chris Godwin, tight end Rob Gronkowski, defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh and edge defender Jason Pierre-Paul in free agency.",
    "Washington Commanders: Desmond Ridder, QB, Cincinnati\nAfter trading for Alex Smith, using a first-round pick on Dwayne Haskins and trotting out journeymen like Taylor Heinicke and Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Commanders need to try and develop a real franchise quarterback.",
    "New York Giants (via Chicago Bears): Derek Stingley Jr., CB, LSU\nWhile fixing the offensive line remains a top priority for the Giants, it’s hard to pass up a special talent like Stingley — especially if New York decides to move on from cornerback James Bradberry.",
    "Tennessee Titans: Jermaine Johnson II, EDGE, Florida State\nOffensive line and tight end are more glaring needs, but the Titans shouldn’t pass on a chance to upgrade their pass rush, especially with star outside linebacker Harold Landry III hitting free agency.",
    "Pittsburgh Steelers: Bernhard Raimann, OT, Central Michigan\nThe Steelers have been heavily linked to quarterbacks like Malik Willis and Kenny Pickett, but the bet here is that Pittsburgh lands an established veteran to take over for Ben Roethlisberger.",
