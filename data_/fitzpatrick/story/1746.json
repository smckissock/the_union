    "+4\nView gallery\nRory McIlroy's hopes of completing the career Grand Slam receded into the distance again\nBut he's never come so close since that fateful Augusta afternoon to claiming the season's first major, and he spent his time yesterday fretting and sweating over making the halfway cut, rather than getting in position to win.",
    "McIlroy felt he'd played better than he scored in his opening round of 73 but, even allowing for the admittedly capricious breezes that made life difficult for everyone, there were still too many mistakes over the first two-thirds of his round to force his way into contention.",
    "+4\nView gallery\nJustin Rose was on Friday night on course to miss the weekend garden party at Augusta\nWith his second straight loop of 76, the 41-year-old was stranded a long way short of where he needed to be on eight over par.",
    "The South African was the man who slipped on the green jacket unnoticed in 2011 while everyone else wanted to wrap their arms around 21-year-old McIlroy, after the Northern Irishman collapsed over the final nine holes.",
    "As Rory McIlroy's hopes of completing the career Grand Slam receded into the distance for another year, the unlikely sight of Charl Schwartzel tied for the early second round lead felt like insult added to injury.",
    "At the 11th, matters came to a head as he backhanded his golf ball into the water by the side of the green after running up a double bogey on the hole that has caused him plenty of grief in the past.",
    "His second round started badly with a bogey at one, got worse with another at seven and, after a brief recovery at 10, it bottomed out on the modified 11th, which was brutally tough in the gusts.",
    "+4\nView gallery\nEnglishman Matt Fitzpatrick started his second round slowly with a three-putt at the first\nMcIlroy believes he is firmly in contention following a battling second round.",
    "After opening with a 71, the 27-year-old from Sheffield started his second round slowly with a three putt at the first and then failing to get his birdie at the par five second.",
    "McIlroy made a wonderful recovery thereafter to win the next major played — the US Open — by a street and also the Open and two PGAs for good measure in the years that followed.",
    "+4\nView gallery\nMcIlroy's misery was compounded by the unlikely sight of Charl Schwartzel tied second\nNow he was four over for the championship, and hovering on the cut line.",
    "His challenge looked to be unravelling when he bogeyed the 10th and ran up a double bogey six on the 11th, hardly ideal preparation with the treacherous par-three 12th next.",
    "His tee shot went into the trees down the right, his second clattered into the crowd and his third, a recovery pitch, skipped through the green and into the pond.",
    "Playing alongside McIlroy was the studious Englishman Matt Fitzpatrick, a far better player than his average majors record suggests.",
    "As it was, he birdied two of them, to move back to two over, where he finished, so maybe all Grand Slam hope is not lost.",
    "Slowly he found his rhythm, getting a good birdie at the sixth and following it with a succession of pars.",
    "In the build-up McIlroy had spoken about going against his natural instincts and playing conservatively.",
    "'Yeah, that was a soft couple of holes there on 10 and 11, giving away three shots,' McIlroy added.",
    "He could have birdied every hole from the 12th to the 16th, following a series of glorious shots.",
    "'Then Brooks Koepka hit first in our group and hit it straight over the green as the wind died.",
    "'And in front of us Jordan Spieth hit two in the water, so that wasn't a great visual either.",
    "I think the conditions look pretty similar tomorrow as well, so I'm looking forward to that.'",
    "You play a decent front nine tomorrow and you're right in the thick of things.",
    "'I'd like to be a couple of shots better, but I'm still right there.",
    "His triple bogey seven effectively killed his trip to the Masters.",
    "'To play the last seven holes in two under was really nice.",
    "After that double, it was like the shackles came off.",
    "He finished with a 73 to be two ahead of McIlroy.",
    "Justin Rose will miss the weekend garden party.",
    "I felt like I left a couple out there too.",
    "'I'm in a decent position,' he said.",
    "I hit the ball very well coming in.",
    "'It's not supposed to be easy.",
    "It's just so up and down.",
    "I had a few chances.'"
