    "@Gil_Brandt identifies one free agent each NFC team must keephttps://t.co/oD67fv9M0V pic.twitter.com/IXTO8266Ru\n— Around The NFL (@AroundTheNFL) February 18, 2022\nAs Skurski noted, Patterson could be a good replacement for McKenzie, if the Bills can afford to get him.",
    "But with so much uncertainty swirling around Atlanta in the final phase of the Matt Ryan era, and with Calvin Ridley’s status with the team up in the air, the Falcons might as well go in for more multi-category fun with the resurgent Patterson,” he wrote.",
    "In the latter part of last season, the Bills moved the speedy Isaiah McKenzie into a bigger role on offense as he filled in for the injured Cole Beasley in the slot and became an asset to the running game by using his speed to stretch the field.",
    "So we’ll continue to look for various ways.”\nMost targets without a drop this season:\n— PFF (@PFF) February 19, 2022\nPatterson also proved himself to be a reliable receiver, with PFF noting that he had the most targets without a drop in 2021.",

    "Bills Could Add Versatile WR/RB/KR\nIn a mailbag, Skurski addressed the option of the Bills targeting Atlanta Falcons wide receiver/kick returner/running back Cordarrelle Patterson in free agency.",
    "Patterson racked up 1,166 yards from scrimmage as a receiver and running back, and also has proven to be one of the league’s most dangerous kick returners, with eight career return touchdowns.",
    "He noted that Patterson is headed back to the open market after outplaying the one-year, $3 million contract he was given by the Falcons, and has likely earned a raise on his next deal.",
    "But with McKenzie headed to free agency, Jay Skurski of the Buffalo News wondered if the team might take a swing at signing an improved and more accomplished version of the speedster.",
    "He is expected to be an in-demand free agent, and NFL.com’s Gil Brandt predicts that the Falcons will do everything they can to keep him from hitting the open market.",
    "Patterson Could Fit Buffalo’s Plans\nWhile getting him under contract may be a challenge, Patterson would seem to fit the plans the Bills have for 2022.",
    "“Sure, Patterson’s late-career breakout season — he broke 1,000 scrimmage yards for the first time at age 30 — might pump up his price tag.",
    "The Buffalo Bills could look to give Josh Allen a new weapon by adding one of the league’s most versatile players, an insider speculates.",
    "“You’d love to have a (run after catch) guy that you can get the ball to and he can turn a five-yard pass into a 60-yard touchdown.",
    "Beane spoke after the season about the need for more home run hitters, and Patterson would certainly bring that to the offense.",
    "But the team could also make moves that free up more space, including some strategic cuts and contract restructures.",
    "It would no doubt be intriguing to add him to the offense, but the price tag is the likely holdup,” he wrote.",
    "The Bills will likely have some tight competition if they make a run at Patterson.",
