    "He’s the flashiest looking guy in the locker room and out on the field.”\nWatt, the favorite for NFL Defensive Player of the Year, said that about Haden after Haden’s biggest play of the 2021 season, a textbook tackle of the Tennessee Titans’ Nick Westbrook-Ikhine on fourth down during the final minute of a win against the AFC’s eventual No.",
    "— Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) November 15, 2021\nIt might be a stretch to say that most of his teammates grew up watching Haden play, but not a big one — at least not for the Steelers’ rookies, who were in grade school when he was an All-American cornerback winning a national championship at Florida in the late 2000’s.",
    "So just being able to ask questions to guys like him, soak up the knowledge, is great.”\nHaden’s age, the market and the Steelers’ long list of other positional priorities significantly cloud a possible return in 2022, but if he’s allowed to leave it won’t be because the Steelers haven’t enjoyed having him around.",
    "He’s a guy that I really, really enjoy playing with.”\nRay-Ray McCloud ($950,000 salary) in comparing his fashion sense to @joehaden23 ($7 million salary):\n\"Joe is different money, so you're gonna have a different look with Joe.\"",
    "https://t.co/ZdsnMOdOyT\n— Tribune-ReviewSports (@TribSports) December 20, 2021\nThe “Joe Money” moniker was an obvious one for a man who seems to always have on the newest sneakers and the latest fashions.",
    "And while Joe Haden doesn’t carry the same cachet that two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Ben Roethlisberger does in Pittsburgh, Haden’s stature in the Steelers’ locker room rivaled Roethlisberger.",
    "There’s not too many (12)-year vets who have made over $100 mill who are loving the game and practicing and having so much fun as he is every day, whether it’s in practice, whether it’s in the game.",
    "A few years back, Haden spent about a half hour after a practice walking around the Steelers’ locker room like Santa Claus, handing out new Nike shoes to surprised and grateful teammates.",
    "Even if Joe Haden wasn’t all over the official stat sheet, the Steelers insist it isn’t a coincidence that their defense was full of “splash” on the day he returned to their lineup.",
    "“Joe is probably one my favorite players that I ever played with,” safety Minkah Fitzpatrick said, “not just because of the player he is but because of the man that he is.",
    "According to Spotrac.com, Haden has earned $121.4 million in his NFL career, including $46.4 over the past five seasons from the Steelers.",
    "He toiled for seven seasons with the Cleveland Browns, a two-time Pro Bowl selection and bright spot on teams that went a combined 29-83.",
    "He started 12 of 18 games, missing four full games and parts of four because of groin and foot injuries and a brief bout with covid-19.",
    "Whether he’s going to play anymore or not, we’ll see.”\nHey, Steelers Nation, get the latest news about the Pittsburgh Steelers here.",
    "“I mean, obviously, he drives around with a chauffeur,” then-defensive coordinator Keith Butler said of Haden late in the season.",
    "But what about the team’s second-oldest and second-most tenured NFL player who was still active at the end of the 2021 season?",
    "Last month, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ oldest, most veteran NFL player got plenty of attention while playing his final games.",
    "Haden made $7 million in salary and counted $15.8 million against the cap in 2021, his fifth season with the Steelers.",
    "Still, the swagger Haden brought helped him stay not only relevant but much-respected across the league.",
    "Long a paid endorser of Nike, Haden kept his “cool” even through all the losing — and even into his 30s.",
    "But his presence in the locker room and leadership were arguably almost as valuable to the Steelers.",
    "He’s a great guy to have on our team, that’s for sure.”\nBut will he be on the team any longer?",
    "That is very much in doubt as Haden embarks on unrestricted free agency for the first time.",
    "“He’s come up with (plenty of) plays for us, and he’s been around league for a long time.",
    "You can contact Chris by email at cadamski@triblive.com or via Twitter .",
    "“Young guys gravitate to him because of that passion that be brings.",
    "He’s a vet, he’s a smart guy, he’s a leader in the locker room.",
    "His Steelers career also very well could have come to an end.",
    "He’s seen a lot in this league,” rookie DB Tre Norwood said.",
    "“Joe’s always been a good player,” Butler said last month.",
    "The energy that he brings to the locker room, the passion.",
    "He’s not daggummit hurting for anything, that’s for sure.",
    "Chris Adamski is a Tribune-Review staff writer.",
    "When on the field, he was steady and reliable.",
    "On the defense, they looked up to Joe Money.",
    "“He’s Joe Money,” linebacker T.J. Watt said.",
    "Haden, who turns 33 in April, was the No.",
    "We’ll see what happens to him after this.",
    "“He’s done pretty good in this league.",
    "“He loves the game and he has fun.",
    "7 overall pick of the 2010 draft.",
    "Categories: Sports | Steelers/NFL",
    "The offense has had its Big Ben.",
    "He loves the game of football.",
    "“A good competitor for us.",
    "“He’s seen a lot of game.",
    "He’s got a lot of reps.",
    "He’s a great guy.",
    "“But I love Joe.",
    "“Joe is Year 12.",
    "“He’s got swag.",
    "1 seed."
