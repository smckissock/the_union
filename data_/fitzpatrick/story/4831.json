    "He refused because: “I respect the game too much to do that.”\nWhile many of the moves the franchise made that season — trading Laremy Tunsil, Kenny Stills, Kiko Alonso and Minkah Fitzpatrick, releasing a number of veterans to clear cap space and starting players claimed off waivers or signed off another team’s practice squad after three days of practice — seemingly aligned with an organization’s attempts to tank, Flores said he viewed those personnel decisions as “a challenge.”\nHis theory is that his defiance ruined his relationship with Ross, general manager Chris Grier and CEO Tom Garfinkel.",
    "“If I never coach again, but there’s a significant change, it’ll be worth it.”\nDuring an interview with the I Am Athlete podcast, which I participated in, Flores said pulling back the curtain on how some minorities in the NFL are treated was more important than his personal career goals and his paycheck, which he hasn’t received yet from the Dolphins because he refused to sign a release forfeiting his legal rights to sue.",
    "He hopes that’s not the case, but knew that could potentially be a reality after filing a lawsuit against the NFL, accusing the league of being “rife with racism, particularly when it comes to the hiring and retention of Black head coaches, coordinators and general managers.”\nThere is, however, a good chance he will become the Colin Kaepernick of the coaching world.",
    "He’ll be working with his son’s 7-on-7 Broward-based flag football team in the coming weeks, using the game he loves to guide young men the same way coaches assisted him as a kid, helping him use football as his escape from the poverty and despair he saw growing up in the projects of Brownsville, Brooklyn.",
    "Flores said an oversight committee is needed when it comes to hiring coaches and executives and a process that monitors and evaluates the hiring process must be put in place to prevent “sham” interviews he felt he participated in during 2019 and 2022.",
    "According to Flores, he’d rather keep his integrity than fill his bank account, pointing out he survived on his $20,000 a year salary when he got his big break as a scouting assistant two decades ago with the New England Patriots.",
    "The release, which was presented to him when he was fired last month, would have kept Flores from saying anything disparaging against the Dolphins in exchange for the $6 million he’s owed on the five-year contract he signed.",

    "The biggest point of contention I had during our discussion was when Flores addressed his relationship with Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who led Miami to a 13-8 record during his two-year tenure as a starter.",
    "I think he’d say the same thing.”\nAccording to team sources, Tagovailoa and Flores had a heated exchange during last month’s 34-3 loss to the Tennessee Titans, which derailed Miami’s push to advance to the playoffs.",
    "In the lawsuit and subsequent interviews, Flores alleges that Dolphins owner Steve Ross offered to pay him $100,000 for every loss at the end of the 2019 season, to potentially improve Miami’s draft standing.",
    "During last week’s Super Bowl news conference, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged the league has a serious problem when it comes its hiring practices and admits the Rooney Rule isn’t working.",
    "Flores also pointed out that being stern and holding players and coaches accountable is usually not viewed as a bad thing when it comes from a head coach trying to change the culture of a franchise.",
    "Flores points out that the root of the problem is that all 32 owners acknowledge that there’s an issue, but would all claim they aren’t prejudice and don’t feel they are part of the problem.",
    "“I know coaching is what I was born to do, but this was my calling in life,” Flores said, referring to his lawsuit, which he hopes eludes arbitration for the sake of transparency.",
    "As far as the NFL, Flores, who was fired by the Miami Dolphins after producing a 24-25 record in three seasons, is prepared to never coach at the highest level of the game.",
    "The Dolphins’ monthlong hiring process, which ended with naming Mike McDaniel as Flores’ replacement, hints the organization wanted someone they could control.",
    "That was one of Tagovailoa’s worst games and, according to a source, Tagovailoa told Flores that he needs to learn how to communicate better with people.",
    "The most important points Flores made during his sit down with I Am Athlete, which airs on Monday, focus on Miami’s “tanking” efforts in 2019.",
    "But if change comes, and generations of aspiring Black coaches and executives benefit from it, then, he said, the sacrifice was worth it.",

    "And oftentimes the player challenges the coach.",
    "The world can think what it wants to think.",
    "He acknowledged that he’s direct and firm.",
