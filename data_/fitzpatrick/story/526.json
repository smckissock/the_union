    "Add that to trades for four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Matt Ryan and Pro Bowl pass rusher Yannick Ngakoue, plus the hire of longtime defensive coordinator Gus Bradley and his trademark Seattle-style scheme, and the Colts have pushed the chips in on a window that’s now open during the lifespan of their new quarterback.",
    "From Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce to Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs to Derek Carr and DaVante Adams to Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase to Deshaun Watson and Amari Cooper, the AFC playoffs were always going to throw the kitchen sink at a secondary and see if it had the physical and mental toughness to survive.",
    "They replaced Matt Eberflus, who preferred run-stopping edge defenders and interior pressure, with Bradley, who runs an attacking front four with a \"LEO\" edge rusher who lines up in a wide-9 stance and gets after the quarterback like every play is 3rd-and-10.",
    "Add in the occasional blitz from Leonard and Moore II, who have 22 combined sacks, plus the ability to simulate pressures and drop coverage, and the Colts should start to live in the heads of quarterbacks in ways they never could last season.",
    "He needed a proven, elite athlete to step into the role and build the rest of the rush plan around it, so the Colts traded for the most proven player he's worked with in Ngakoue, who has 55.5 sacks in six seasons.",
    "At 27 years old, Ngakoue gives the Colts one more Pro Bowler in his prime years on defense to go along with nickel Kenny Moore II (26), defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (28) and linebacker Darius Leonard (26).",
    "Indianapolis finished eighth in defense, per Football Outsiders' DVOA metric, and second in turnovers last season but also had a clear flaw in its inability to close out games with the pass rush.",
    "The double teams that Buckner creates, at a level second only to Aaron Donald, will now have a direct payoff with Ngakoue, who has never had fewer than eight sacks in a season.",
    "The Colts’ latest splash is their most aggressive yet, as they agreed to terms with five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Stephon Gilmore on Friday, a source confirmed to IndyStar.",
    "The Colts see Ryan, a 14-year starter, as a tone-setter for an offense that mostly needed a point guard to play with the balance it has long sought around Jonathan Taylor.",
    "But defense is a reactive job, and well-coached units can also microwave a retool by placing proven commodities in premium roles and making everyone else's job easier.",
    "But unlike last season, when they chased around star quarterbacks in the fourth quarter aimlessly and watched their leads slip, the horses are in the barn this time.",
    "On the outside, the Colts have a physical veteran to match physical veterans in Gilmore and a sleek speed option to take the fastest opposing receiver in Rodgers.",
    "Opposite him is the \"big end,\" taking on the tight end as well as the tackle, and it'll be a committee between 265-pound Kwity Paye and 276-pound Dayo Odeyingbo.",
    "They long had a well-coached defense under Mike Tomlin but lacked the back-end talent to complement their front-end of Cam Heyward, T.J. Watt and Stephon Tuitt.",
    "That experience matters because this is a passing league and a conference filled with the quarterbacks and receivers to break a young defensive back's spirit.",
    "But perhaps his best friend in a transition to a new team for the first time could be what he almost never had with the Falcons: an elite defense.",
    "The AFC is full of quarterbacks who will occasionally escape that pressure, from Mahomes to Lamar Jackson to Russell Wilson to Watson to Allen.",
    "The secondary, which will run plenty of Cover-3 with match-man principles when routes find enough vertical depth, should be a strength.",
    "They want to build a top-five defense for Matt Ryan, who hasn't played with one of those since 2011, his fourth season in the NFL.",
    "The next year, Pittsburgh signed veteran Chiefs cornerback Steven Nelson and traded for a superstar safety in Minkah Fitzpatrick.",
    "On pass rushing downs, Stewart will come off the field and Odeyingbo will slide inside next to Paye to rush against guards.",
    "And some lag time should be expected with new pieces fitting into a new scheme after four years of a different one.",
    "They'll need the right availability, added depth moves and a breakout or two from a player now in an easier role.",
    "FOR SUBSCRIBERS: Gregg Doyel: Colts just did something big by signing Stephon Gilmore, but is it something good?",
    "On base downs, 315-pound Grover Stewart and 295-pound Buckner will bring a steady run-stopping presence inside.",
    "Gilmore brings both as the 2019 Defensive Player of the Year and a man who has reached four straight Pro Bowls.",
    "Indianapolis beat out suitors such as the Eagles, Bills and Rams for the 2019 Defensive Player of the Year.",
    "The problems have been related to scheme and personnel, and the Colts addressed both this offseason.",
    "The Colts first signed safety Rodney McLeod, who has 123 career starts and a ring with the Eagles.",
    "For years now, the turnovers have been bankable but either the pass rush or the coverage has not.",
    "Except there's one problem: Only one of these players, Buckner, has made it far in the playoffs.",
    "Opponents had to confront the nightmares of the front four without holes to exploit in coverage.",
    "And in the middle of all of this chaos will be Leonard, the NFL's reigning leader in turnovers.",
    "He'll read the eyes of quarterbacks as they throw and wield that Peanut Punch at the ball.",
    "They have a lockdown nickel corner to prevent teams from creating mismatches in the slot.",
    "Those two, along with Moore II, will raise the belief of a secondary in need of it.",
    "The 246-pound Ngakoue will play the \"LEO,\" rushing every play like it's must-pass.",
    "Then they signed Gilmore, who has 125 career starts and a ring with the Patriots.",
    "As Ryan turns 37 this offseason, he will need support on both sides of the ball.",
    "McLeod at least brings the former as one of the biggest leaders on the Eagles.",
    "The deal is for two years and around $23 million with $14 million guaranteed.",
    "This defensive transfusion is reminiscent of the Steelers of a few years ago.",
    "That aggressiveness is playing out much more on defense as time has gone on.",
    "Chris Ballard stressed a little bit of patience and that he had a plan.",
    "The Colts have that potential now, in ways they haven’t for years.",
    "Rodgers and Moore II are smaller bodies susceptible to collisions.",
    "Strong safety Khari Willis has missed some time with injuries.",
    "That's where being competent and confident in coverage is key.",
    "Jim Irsay promised this would be an “All chips in” offseason.",
    "Free safety Julian Blackmon is coming off an Achilles tear.",
    "Contact Colts insider Nate Atkins at natkins@indystar.com.",
    "So this week became about finding those missing links.",
    "And he plays on the first of a four-level defense.",
    "But it won't be the strength of the Colts defense.",
    "Gilmore has missed 14 games the past two seasons.",
    "Health is always the Achilles heel of identity.",
    "Blackmon is working back from an Achilles tear.",
    "Cornerback Isaiah Rodgers has started one game.",
    "They can all now progress on their timelines.",
    "It's time to see just how far they can roam.",
    "That defense finished 14th in DVOA in 2018.",
    "That's what Gilmore and Ngakoue can do.",
    "The boats then raised everywhere else.",
    "Those statements are aging quite well.",
    "That's the dream the Colts have now.",
    "The defensive line depth is suspect.",
    "Follow him on Twitter @NateAtkins_.",
    "This is the ideal unit, of course.",
    "And the Steelers finished No.",
    "3 in DVOA in 2019 and No.",
    "That starts up front.",
    "1 in 2020."
