    "Coach Mike Tomlin didn’t rule anything out at his season-ending press conference, saying “all options are on the table.”\nTomlin, though, reiterated the two “major” ways the Steelers can add to a position group that includes Mason Rudolph and Dwayne Haskins.",
    "Trades involving high-profile quarterbacks returned to fashion last offseason with the Los Angeles Rams and Detroit Lions swapping starters Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff and the Philadelphia Eagles sending Carson Wentz to the Indianapolis Colts.",
    "Free agency\nThe league year begins March 16, and here are several quarterbacks who could be hitting the open market:\nTeddy Bridgewater\n2021 base salary: $4.25 million\nPros: Started 14 games this season with Denver and 15 in 2020 with Carolina.",
    "And then we kind of bring those two discussions together, and it kind of gives us a path in which to go about addressing our needs.”\nRudolph and Haskins have been told they will compete for the starting job in training camp.",
    "And the last deal involving a quarterback with Super Bowl experience came in 1984 when, after bypassing Dan Marino in the draft a year earlier, the Steelers dealt for his predecessor on the Miami Dolphins, David Woodley.",
    "Ryan Fitzpatrick\n2021 base salary: $3 million\nPros: He would bring experience to the position room, having made 147 starts in 17 seasons, and he passed for 3,500 yards as recently as 2019.",
    "Jameis Winston\n2021 base salary: $1 million (with two void years on contract)\nPros: He is still only 28 years old and has seven years of experience with Tampa Bay and New Orleans.",
    "Kenny Pickett, Pitt\nPros: He was a Heisman Trophy finalist after finishing as Pitt’s career passing leader and setting an ACC record for touchdown passes in a season.",
    "One would have to go back to 1958 when the Steelers acquired Bobby Layne from Detroit to find the last time they landed a veteran with Hall of Fame credentials.",
    "Malik Willis, Liberty\nPros: He was the FBS top rushing quarterback in 2019, and he showed off his arm in 2020 by throwing a school-record 27 touchdown passes.",
    "Sam Howell, North Carolina\nPros: In 2020, the year before Pickett took the ACC by storm, Howell led the conference in passing yards and touchdown passes.",
    "Matt Corral, Mississippi\nPros: He’s a mobile quarterback who cut down his turnovers significantly in 2021, throwing five picks as opposed to 14 in 2020.",
    "Marcus Mariota\n2021 base salary: $3.5 million\nPros: He would be accepting of a backup role based on two years playing behind David Carr in Las Vegas.",
    "Cons: He could be knocked for dominating at a lower level of competition, and he threw six interceptions over his final three regular-season games.",
    "Such trades would require the Steelers to part with the draft capital necessary to fill the franchise’s voids on the offensive and defensive lines.",
    "Desmond Ridder, Cincinnati\nPros: He is a winner, having compiled a 41-5 record for the Bearcats and leading them to the college playoffs in 2021.",
    "Cons: His college career ended with a scary ankle sprain that, had it been more serious, could have hurt his draft standing as a first-rounder.",
    "Which makes it unlikely the Steelers will find Ben Roethlisberger’s replacement by pursuing Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson in the offseason.",
    "Cons: With North Carolina losing several top targets, Howell’s numbers dipped in his junior season, and he got off to a slow start.",
    "Cons: He’s only about eight months younger than the 39-year-old Roethlisberger and started just one game for Washington in 2021.",
    "Cons: After returning to Carolina in midseason, he went 0-5 as a starter and was replaced when Sam Darnold returned to health.",
    "He also has played for four teams in seven years, never quite living up to his potential as a former first-round pick.",
    "Cam Newton\n2021 base salary: $4.5 million\nPros: He has made 144 starts in 11 seasons and has appeared in a Super Bowl.",
    "Cons: Former first-rounder never lived up to potential and has attempted only 30 passes over the past two years.",
    "Such deals don’t come along every offseason, and they are even rarer when they involve the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
    "Cons: Bridgewater was concussed twice this past season and finished the year on injured reserve.",
    "In 2004, Roethlisberger was the last first-rounder drafted by the Steelers, who hold the No.",
    "Cons: He has a slender frame and, like Willis, dominated against non-Power 5 competition.",
    "We have to look at what’s available to us potentially in free agency, positionally.",
    "Draft\nThe first round will be held April 28, six weeks after free agency starts.",
    "Cons: He likely won’t be on the board when the Steelers make their first pick.",
    "“You do it through free agency, and you do it through the draft,” Tomlin said.",
    "He was 5-2 as starter with Saints, tossing 14 TDs against three interceptions.",
    "The question is whether the Steelers add a veteran or a prospect to the mix.",
    "Or even two others presented by oddsmakers: Derek Carr and Jimmy Garoppolo.",
    "“We have to look at what’s available to us in the draft, positionally.",
    "You can contact Joe by email at jrutter@triblive.com or via Twitter .",
    "Would bring mobility to the position, which Tomlin covets.",
    "Threw an NFL-high 30 interceptions with Tampa Bay in 2019.",
    "He set a career high with 18 touchdown passes in 2021.",
    "Cons: Suffered season-ending ACL tear in November.",
    "He accounted for 116 touchdowns in his career.",
    "Joe Rutter is a Tribune-Review staff writer.",
    "Categories: Sports | Steelers/NFL",
    "20 pick this year.",
    "Brings mobility."
