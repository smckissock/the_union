    "Manning, Brady or whomever, would bring a new face to assemble a professional organization that knows how to do fundamental things like operate a season, conduct a proper coaching search and stay off the radar of NFL investigations like the one starting up now against the Dolphins.",
    "Then came the national embarrassments of Bullygate and an assistant coach snorting cocaine in Dolphins offices in a video released by a Vegas, uh, “model.”\nNow there’s this case, where a team that’s lost plenty doesn’t lose enough for the No.",
    "Former Dolphins coach Brian Flores made the television rounds Wednesday morning, setting the narrative about his lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in NFL hiring and discussing how Ross offered him $100,000 for each loss.",

    "That’s just who I am.”\nRoss denied it loudly in a statement Wednesday night, calling the allegations, “false, malicious and defamatory.” Everyone has lawyered up.",

    "Ross can still run Hard Rock Stadium, where he’s made buckets of money on tennis, a grass company and soon a Formula One race.",

    "Until Ross came aboard, the big crisis was how coach Nick Saban left town in 2006 — an entirely different story.",
    "If the Dolphins wanted to tank in 2019 — and the owner and front office did — they do it properly.",
    "Ross’s reign has been one embarrassment after another, with Flores’ firestorm being the biggest.",
    "Flores said on ESPN Ross suggested, “taking a vacation,” and offered the money as an incentive.",
    "It’s one thing to hedge ideas to protect Flores or Ross to a reporter or league investigator.",
    "You get a subpoena from the Justice Department considering the allegation is of fixing games?",
    "Now we’re learning just how badly, perhaps illegally, the Dolphins tried to tank for the No.",
    "Beal should then offer a slice of the team to some respected football name — Peyton Manning?",
    "Have Beal go out and get real a football person with a respected reputation to run the team.",
    "Let’s hope Steve Ross throws in the towel as easily as he allegedly asked his coach to do.",
    "That’s the best way out of the latest and messiest fiasco of his Miami Dolphins ownership.",
    "It’s posted in every NFL locker room that it’s not just against league rules to do that.",
    "Just like the Heat did when they hired Pat Riley and the Marlins did with Derek Jeter.",
    "If Ross stays as the Dolphins owner, there will be something for a next crisis.",

    "The Dolphins have done more in the community than any other NFL franchise.",
    "Not that they’re on speaking terms, except through lawyers at this point.",
    "Before that, maybe receiver Mark Duper being arrested for drugs in 1988.",
    "There’s one way out: Ross agrees to lay down like he asked Flores to do.",
    "But it’s clear after 13 years, he doesn’t know how to run a sports team.",
    "Bring in Beal, who has traveled in Ross’s inner circle for a few years.",
    "No one even needs to insult Ross by offering $100,000 to quit.",

    "This is the latest sordid episode under Ross’s ownership, too.",
    "Anyone asked to fix games has to report that to the league.",
    "Worse, he doesn’t know that he doesn’t know how to do it.",
    "The question becomes: Who else is coming to investigate?",
    "No coach worth his playbook will agree to throw games.",
    "No one will know what to think about the rookie coach.",

    "That’s another matter.",
    "Throw in the towel.",
    "It’s time to sell.",
    "— to run the team.",
    "Flores’ response?",
    "There always is.",
    "He’s really not.",
    "1 pick in 2019.",
    "Let’s see them.",
