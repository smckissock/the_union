    "Similar to the perforin- or Fas-FasL–dependent suppression of self-reactive CD4+ T cells by murine Ly49+CD8+ T cells (4, 7, 35), human KIR+CD8+ T cells likely target pathogenic CD4+ T cells through direct killing because KIR+CD8+ T cells significantly up-regulate cytotoxic molecules and suppress gliadin-specific CD4+ T cells in a contact-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis.",
    "GLIPH2 analysis\nSingle-cell TCR sequences of sorted KIR+ (6815 unique TCRs) and KIR–CD8+ T cells (1630 unique TCRs) from HCs (N = 10), MS (N = 2), SLE (N = 20), CeD (N = 5), T1D (N = 5), and COVID-19 (N = 5) patients and bulk TCRß sequences of sorted KIR+CD8+ T cells from nine HCs (5607 unique TCRß) along with their class I HLA alleles were used as inputs.",
    "In this work, we identify CD8+ T cells expressing inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)—the functional counterpart of the mouse Ly49 family in humans (8)—as a regulatory CD8+ T cell subset in humans that suppresses pathogenic CD4+ T cells in celiac disease (CeD) and likely other autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases as well.",
    "After two washes with FACS buffer, 10% of the cells were reserved for FACS analysis and 90% were labeled with anti–phycoerythrin (PE) microbeads and subjected to magnetic bead enrichment of PE-conjugated tetramer-positive cells using a single magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) column according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi).",
    "scRNA-seq analysis of kidneys and synovial tissues\nThe unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrices of cells in kidneys (accession code SDY997) (50) or synovial tissues (accession code SDY998) (51) generated by CEL-Seq2 were downloaded from the ImmPort repository, and downstream analysis was performed using the Seurat 3.0 package (52).",
    "TCRs of KIR+CD8+ T cells from healthy donors and different diseases could be grouped into the same GLIPH clusters, although with different extents of clonal expansion (Table 1), which indicates that they may recognize the same antigens that commonly exist under physiological and different pathological conditions.",
    "Finally, the selective depletion of Ly49+CD8+ T cells in virus-infected mice did not interfere with the antiviral responses but resulted in exacerbated autoimmunity after infection, demonstrating the critical role that this subset of CD8+ Tregs plays in controlling harmful self-reactivity in infectious diseases.",
    "This suggests that increase of KIR+CD8+ T cells is a general mechanism induced during an infection, which, in classical murine studies, has been seen to break tolerance—that is, allow the activation of self-reactive T cells that normally require innate immune signals in addition to their cognate antigens (36).",
    "Although there is still much more to learn about KIR+CD8+ T cells and their murine equivalents, the data presented here and in previous studies indicate that they represent an important element in peripheral tolerance and in our understanding of the relationship between autoimmunity and infectious diseases.",
    "Gene Ontology analysis plots were generated with the R package “clusterProfiler.” To generate gene sets for GSEA, we selected the top 200 genes up-regulated in Ly49+CD8+ T cells compared with Ly49–CD8+ T cells in EAE mice (7) and the previously reported CD4+ Treg signature genes identified in mice (17).",
    "To better understand the similarity and heterogeneity of KIR+CD8+ T cells under different circumstances, we performed scRNA-seq on 4512 KIR+CD8+ T cells sorted from healthy subjects and patients with MS, SLE, or CeD using the Smart-seq2 protocol (26) and analyzed their TCR a and ß sequences (27).",
    "Our findings also provide insights into understanding the relationship between autoimmunity and infectious diseases and into the development of potential therapeutic approaches targeting KIR+CD8+ T cells to suppress undesirable self-reactivity in autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases.",
    "Quantification of scRNA-seq gene expression by Smart-seq2 and data analysis\nBlood KIR+CD8+ T cells (live CD3+CD56–CD8+TCRaß+KIR+ cells) were sorted into 96-well plates, and cDNA synthesis was performed using the Smart-seq2 protocol (26) with minor modifications described previously (54).",
    "Similarly, influenza-infected Klra6creDTA mice displayed more-severe inflammation and pathology characterized by peribronchial and interstitial accumulation of inflammatory cells, pulmonary consolidation, and fibrous tissue hyperplasia in the lung 60 days after influenza infection (Fig.",
    "Abstract\nIn this work, we find that CD8+ T cells expressing inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are the human equivalent of Ly49+CD8+ regulatory T cells in mice and are increased in the blood and inflamed tissues of patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases.",
    "To further investigate whether KIR+CD8+ T cells are the phenotypic equivalent of mouse Ly49+ T cells in humans, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on KIR+ versus KIR–CD8+ T cells from patients with MS to compare with mouse Ly49+CD8+ T cells in EAE, a mouse model of human MS.",
    "Increased KIR+CD8+ T cells in SARS-CoV-2– and influenza-infected patients\nAlthough it was previously accepted that most self-specific T cells were eliminated in the thymus, recent work has shown that many such cells survive and populate the periphery of both humans and mice (18, 19).",

    "In vitro cell proliferation assay\nCD8+ T cells were purified from PBMCs of healthy donors using CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi) per manufacturer’s instructions, stained with flow antibodies, and live CD3+CD56–CD8+KIR+ or KIR– T cells were sorted out by FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer (BD).",
    "Blood samples from patients during influenza virus infection were obtained from patients who had influenza-like symptoms and were tested positive for influenza A virus at the Emergency Department or the Express Outpatient Clinic at Stanford Hospital, which is covered by IRB-22442.",
    "After 450g centrifugation, cells were treated with Fc receptor (FcR) block (Biolegend, 10 µg/ml) in FACS buffer [0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] for 10 min followed by staining with antibodies against surface molecules (30 min, 4°C).",
    "This type of peripheral tolerance is distinct from and likely complementary to the one mediated by CD4+ Tregs, which represent a separate lineage of T cells and do not appear to be generally active in the human infectious diseases analyzed here or in murine infections (37, 38).",
    "Additionally, clonally expanded KIR+CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients identified from the previous 10X Genomics scRNA-seq (24) displayed a higher expression of cytotoxic genes while downregulating naïve- or memory-associated genes compared with unexpanded KIR+CD8+ T cells (fig.",

    "Likewise, our findings on the KIR+CD8+ T cells and their properties described here may be useful in understanding key cellular dynamics in immune dysregulation and in potential therapeutic approaches to suppress undesirable self-reactivity in autoimmune or infectious diseases.",
    "Because KIR receptors deliver inhibitory signals through their ITIMs to suppress the activation and functions of KIR+CD8+ T cells, antibody-dependent blockade of KIR3DL1 or KIR2DL3 may further enhance the suppressive activity of KIR+CD8+ T cells toward pathogenic CD4+ T cells.",
    "These cells, which can suppress self-reactive CD4+ T cells, were more abundant in patients with autoimmune conditions such as celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, and lupus, as well as in patients infected with influenza virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.",
    "The frequency of tetramer-positive cells was calculated by dividing the number of postenrichment tetramer+ CD4+ T cells by the number of CD4+ T cells in the pre-enrichment sample multiplied by 9 (to account for the fact that 90% of the cells were used for the enrichment).",
    "Immunohistochemistry\nTo evaluate the glomerular nephritis in the kidneys of LCMV-infected mice, tissue sections were generated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) kidneys and Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain was performed by Stanford Animal Histology Services.",
    "Quantification of viral load by RT-qPCR\nRNA was extracted from the blood of LCMV-infected mice or the lungs of influenza-infected mice using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and converted to cDNA using Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (cat.",
    "Additionally, the destruction of pathogenic CD4+ T cells by KIR+CD8+ T cells appears to depend on recognition of both classical and nonclassical class I MHC molecules because the blockade of either HLA-ABC or HLA-E can reverse the suppression by KIR+CD8+ T cells.",
    "In the transwell assay, CD8– PBMCs were cultured with 250 µg/ml of deamidated gluten and 50 U/ml of IL-2 in the lower chamber, and preactivated KIR+CD8+ T cells were added to the upper chamber of the Millicell-96 Cell Culture Insert Plate (Millipore Sigma, cat.",
    "They are induced as part of the response during an autoimmune reaction or infection and may act as a negative feedback mechanism to specifically suppress the self-reactive or otherwise pathogenic cells without affecting the immune responses against pathogens.",
    "Although the analysis above shows that the TCR repertoire of KIR+CD8+ T cells is less diverse than KIR–CD8+ T cells generally, it is still considerably diverse, using multiple classical HLAs and HLA-E and probably recognizing many antigenic peptides as well.",
    "Moreover, our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed many similarities between human KIR+CD8+ T cells and mouse Ly49+CD8+ T cells, which suggests that KIR+CD8+ T cells are the functional and phenotypic equivalents of mouse Ly49+CD8+ T cells in humans.",
    "Moreover, elevated levels of KIR+CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), were also observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)– or influenza-infected patients and correlated with vasculitis in COVID-19 patients.",
    "Using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (23), we also found an increased frequency of KIR+CD8+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe disease compared with that from HCs (Fig.",

    "Unsupervised clustering of these KIR+CD8+ T cells identified six clusters, with clusters 1 to 3 mostly containing expanded KIR+CD8+ T cells (=2 cells expressing same TCR), and clusters 5 and 6 consisting of unexpanded cells expressing unique TCRs (Fig.",
    "Clinical metadata were obtained from the Stanford clinical data electronic medical record system as per consented participant permission, and definitions and diagnoses of disease were used according to Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 20e.",
    "RATIONALE\nBecause killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are the evolutionary counterpart of the mouse Ly49 family in humans, we investigated whether KIR+CD8+ T cells are the phenotypic and functional equivalent of mouse Ly49+CD8+ T cells.",
    "Compared with KIR– effector CD8+ T cells, KIR+ effector CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of IKZF2 and NK cell–associated genes (e.g., TYROBP, KLRC2, KLRC3, NCR1, and NCR3) while expressing lower levels of IL7R, CD27, and KLRB1 (table S3).",
    "The CD8– PBMCs were stimulated with 250 µg/ml of deamidated gluten or 10 µg/ml of influenza A HA 306-318 peptide (PKYVKQNTLKLAT) or left unstimulated at 3 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells/100 µl per well supplemented with 50 U/ml or 300 U/ml of IL-2.",
    "CD8+ T cells (expressing CD3D, CD3E, CD8A, and CD8B transcripts) and CD4+ T cells (expressing CD3D, CD3E, and CD4 transcripts) were selected for standard downstream procedures of log-normalization, variable gene selection, and data scaling.",
    "Because the KIR+CD8+ T cells we focused on in this study express inhibitory KIR receptors, which contain intracellular ITIMs, we investigated how these KIR receptors contribute to the differentiation and functionality of KIR+CD8+ T cells.",
    "In vitro, KIR+CD8+ T cells were able to specifically eliminate gliadin-specific pathogenic CD4+ T cells from the leukocytes of CeD patients through their cytotoxicity in a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–dependent manner.",
    "We next compared the diversity of KIR+CD8+ TCRs with KIR–CD8+ TCRs from the same individuals (N = 26) and found that TCRs of KIR+CD8+ T cells had significantly lower Shannon-Wiener indices and Chao estimates than KIR–CD8+ T cells (Fig.",
    "Klra6creDTA mice did not appear to spontaneously develop any autoimmune disorders or exhibit changes in their frequencies of effector T cells, T follicular helper (TFH) cells, or germinal center (GC) B cells up to 8 months of age (fig.",
    "However, the frequency of Ly49+CD8+ T cells in Klra6creDTA mice remained very low at all times after viral challenge, whereas Ly49+ NK cells in Klra6creDTA mice showed only minor reductions compared with DTA (wild-type) mice (figs.",
    "We have hypothesized that this occurs because the threat of infectious diseases (20) necessitates a complete T cell repertoire (18, 21), such that even self-reactive T cells might be needed in the response to a particular pathogen.",
    "CD8+ T cells were purified from PBMCs using CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi) per manufacturer’s instructions, stained with flow antibodies, and live CD3+CD56–CD8+KIR+ or KIR– T cells were sorted out by FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer (BD).",
    "To further elucidate their role in infectious diseases, we analyzed the effects of selective ablation of their murine counterpart on the antiviral responses during infection and tissue pathology after resolution of viral infection.",
    "We performed principal components analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction on the integrated data, then clustered cells with the Louvain algorithm and visualized the data using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP).",
    "To compare the antigen specificities of KIR+CD8+ T cells from different disease types, we also analyzed the TCR sequences using GLIPH2 (28), which is an algorithm to cluster TCRs that recognize the same antigen in most cases.",
    "By contrast, we did not observe any difference in the levels of CD25hiCD127loCD4+ Tregs or KIR+ NK cells in COVID-19 patients compared with HCs or in COVID-19 patients with different disease severities or complications (fig.",
    "Correlations between KIR+CD8+ T cells and tumor immune surveillance (31, 32) or chronic viral infections (33, 34) have been reported, but the suppressive functions of this population have not been clearly defined previously.",
    "However, whether a similar CD8+ regulatory T cell subset exists in humans and whether its suppressive activity extends beyond autoimmune diseases to play a more general role in peripheral tolerance remains to be determined.",
    "report the existence of a similar CD8+ T cell subset in humans that expresses killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), a functional parallel of the mouse Ly49 family (see the Perspective by Levescot and Bensussan).",
    "Therefore, we analyzed CD8+ T cells expressing inhibitory KIRs (which we refer to as KIR+CD8+ T cells) (9, 10) in the peripheral blood of patients with autoimmune diseases and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs).",
    "For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set (eBioscience), followed by staining with antibodies against intracellular antigens (30 min, 4°C).",
    "We further filtered the resulting GLIPH clusters to 62 specificity groups that contained TCRs from three or more individuals and exhibited significant bias of V-gene usage (P < 0.05), and some of them are shown in Table 1.",

    "Moreover, we developed an in vitro functional assay to test their regulatory functions on gliadin-specific disease-driving CD4+ T cells from patients with celiac disease (CeD) and to study the mechanisms of suppression.",
    "Consistent with the transcriptional profiles, KIR+CD8+ T cells had higher protein expression of granzyme B, perforin, CX3CR1, KLRG1, CD244, TIGIT, T-bet, and Helios and lower levels of CCR7, CD27, and CD28 (fig.",
    "Therefore, we hypothesize that a major role of these CD8+ regulatory T cells is to control autoreactive T cells that are activated during an infection, likely because they are cross-reactive to foreign antigens.",
    "For the first TCR reaction, 1 µl of the cDNA products of Smart-seq2 was preamplified with HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) using multiplex PCR with multiple Va and Vß region primers, Ca and Cß region primers.",
    "The suppression by KIR+CD8+ T cells was contact dependent because their inhibitory effects on gliadin-specific CD4+ T cells were abrogated when they were separated from the CD8– PBMCs by a membrane insert (Fig.",
    "Although most CD8+ T cells are geared toward the control of pathogen-infected or cancerous cells, there has been long-standing evidence in mice that a small subset can also suppress autoimmune responses (1).",
    "Commonality and heterogeneity of KIR+CD8+ T cells\nWe next performed scRNA-seq analysis on peripheral blood CD8+ T cells from HCs, MS patients, and COVID-19 patients (24) using the 10X Genomics platform (25).",
    "They typically have immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic tails and are ubiquitously expressed on NK cells as well as on a small subset (1 to 5%) of CD8+ T cells (5).",
    "KIR+CD8+ T cells are the functional and phenotypic equivalent of mouse Ly49+CD8+ T cells\nWe next investigated whether KIR+CD8+ T cells are the functional counterpart of mouse Ly49+ regulatory CD8+ T cells.",
    "These cells can suppress myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)–specific pathogenic CD4+ T cells through their cytolytic activity and thereby ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).",
    "Thus, KIR+CD8+ T cells appear to be the functional and phenotypic equivalent of mouse Ly49+CD8+ T cells in humans, with many conserved features in both healthy subjects and those with autoimmune diseases.",
    "PBMCs from MS patients were also obtained from the Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), with the protocol approved by the committee on Human Research at UCSF.",
    "CD8– peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DQ2.5+ CeD patients were cultured with preactivated KIR+ and KIR–CD8+ T cells supplemented with deamidated gluten (fig.",
    "This regulatory function of CD8+ T cells was first implicated by the depletion of CD8+ T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of human multiple sclerosis (MS) (2, 3).",
    "Recently, our research group found that clonally expanded CD8+ T cells in EAE recognized peptides bound to H2-Db and that these peptides stimulate Ly49+CD8+ regulatory T cells and suppress disease (7).",

    "Previous studies have suggested that the regulatory function of mouse Ly49+CD8+ T cells is mediated by recognition of both classical (7) and nonclassical class I MHCs (4, 5, 13) on their target cells.",
    "There are common features shared by KIR+CD8+ T cells from healthy subjects and from subjects with different diseases, yet there is also heterogeneity associated with different diseases or treatments.",
    "The sorted KIR+ and KIR–CD8+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Gibco) at 1:1 ratio (1 µl of beads per 4 × 104 cells) supplemented with 50 U/ml of IL-2 in 96-well plates for 18 hours.",
    "The Ly49 family of inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptors, which are ubiquitous on natural killer (NK) cells, were identified as specific surface markers for this regulatory CD8+ T cell subset (5).",
    "Notably, expanded KIR+CD8+ T cells from healthy subjects and different diseases displayed shared phenotypes and similar TCR sequences as revealed by single-cell RNA-seq and TCR sequencing (TCR-seq).",
    "In Klra6creR26R-EYFP mice (EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein), all of the YFP+ cells expressed CD3 or NK1.1, indicating that the Cre expression is restricted to NK, T, and NKT cells (fig.",
    "The sorted KIR+ or KIR–CD8+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Gibco) at 1:1 ratio (1 µl beads per 4 × 104 cells) supplemented with 50 U/ml of IL-2 in 96-well plates for 18 hours.",
    "After removal of anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads, KIR+ and KIR- CD8+ T cells were mixed with CTV-labeled CD8- PBMCs at 1:30, 1:15, or 1:10 ratios and cultured in 96-well plate precoated with anti-CD3.",
    "Then 2 µl of the purified products were subjected to quality control using capillary electrophoresis on a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) by Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility.",
    "Expanded KIR+ cells in clusters 1 to 3 had higher transcripts for cytotoxic molecules (e.g., GZMH, GZMB, and PRF1) and genes associated with effector T cells (e.g., FCGR3A, FGFBP2, and CX3CR1).",
    "Moreover, the highest frequencies of KIR+CD8+ T cells were found in patients with vasculitis or embolism and, to a lesser extent, in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fig.",
    "For analysis of IgG deposition in kidney, frozen sections from mouse kidneys were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen), and images were acquired using Leica SP8.",
    "KIR+CD8+ T cells appeared to target only the pathogenic CD4+ T cells because they had no discernible effect on hemagglutinin (HA)–specific CD4+ T cells induced by influenza A HA peptides (fig.",
    "Data and materials availability: Raw and processed RNA-seq data that support the findings of this study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number GSE193442.",
    "Thus, KIR+CD8+ T cells specifically eliminate gliadin-specific CD4+ T cells from the leukocytes of CeD patients through the recognition of classical and/or nonclassical class I MHC molecules.",
    "This extended the original observations beyond Qa-1 to encompass classical class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) interactions, suggesting a general mechanism of peripheral tolerance.",
    "Furthermore, KIR+CD8+ T cells expressed higher transcript levels for Helios (encoded by IKZF2), a transcription factor associated with regulatory functions of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (6).",
    "Thus, KIR+CD8+ T cells suppress pathogenic CD4+ T cells through direct killing instead of a competition for IL-2, consistent with the perforin dependance of Ly49+CD8+ T cells in mice (4, 7).",
    "Similar to the circulating KIR+CD8+ T cells, both kidney and synovial KIR+CD8+ T cells up-regulated KLRG1, CD244, TIGIT, CX3CR1, PRF1, GZMB, and IKZF2 and down-regulated CD28 and CCR7 (fig.",
