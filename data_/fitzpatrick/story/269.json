    "Offensive line\nProjected starters: Taylor Lewan, Jamarco Jones, Ben Jones, Nate Davis, Dillon Radunz\nDepth: Aaron Brewer, Christian DiLauro, Derwin Gray, Daniel Munyer, Jordan Roos\nPass protection was one of Tennessee’s biggest issues last season – Tannehill was sacked 47 times, second-most in the NFL – and two starters need to be replaced, with left guard Rodger Saffold released and right tackle David Quessenberry not tendered as a restricted free agent.",
    "Running back\nProjected starters: Derrick Henry, Tory Carter (fullback)\nDepth: Dontrell Hilliard, Jordan Wilkins, Trenton Cannon\nHenry might still be a superstar, but the Titans would be wise to start thinking about his long-term replacement after he missed nine games in 2021 with a Jones fracture.",
    "Defensive line\nProjected starters: Jeffery Simmons, Denico Autry, Teair Tart\nDepth: Larrell Murchison, Naquan Jones, Kevin Strong, Da’Shawn Hand\nSimmons and Autry formed one of the NFL’s most disruptive interior defensive-line tandems last season, and that should stay the same in 2022.",
    "Cornerback\nProjected starters: Kristian Fulton, Caleb Farley, Elijah Molden (nickel)\nDepth: Buster Skrine, Chris Jackson, Shyheim Carter, Kobe Jones, Justin Lawler\nThe Titans could be in trouble at cornerback if 2021 first-rounder Caleb Farley doesn’t stay healthy (and produce).",
    "Punter\nProjected starter: Brett Kern\nDepth: n/a\nKern is still one of the top punters in the game, but his play has declined the past couple seasons from his All-Pro 2019 campaign (He ranked 22nd in punts downed inside the 20 and 18th in punting average last season).",
    "Quarterback\nProjected starter: Ryan Tannehill\nDepth: Logan Woodside, Kevin Hogan\nTannehill is the Titans’ starter (for right now), but Tennessee needs to start looking at long-term options at the most important position.",
    "Here’s the breakdown:\nOutside linebacker\nProjected starters: Harold Landry, Bud Dupree\nDepth: Rashad Weaver, Ola Adeniyi, Nate Hall, Kobe Jones, Justin Lawler\nLandry and a healthy Dupree are double-digit sack threats.",
    "To many team observers, Tannehill’s three-interception performance in the AFC divisional-round loss to the Bengals adds to a resume that suggests he’s not the quarterback who can lead the Titans to the Super Bowl.",
    "Depth: Monty Rice, Dylan Cole, Tuzar Skipper, Joe Jones\nRashaan Evans and Jayon Brown are gone, but Cunningham and Long showed last season that they are Tennessee’s inside linebacker tandem for 2022 and beyond.",
    "Tennessee's offense revolves around a strong run game, and D’Onta Foreman, who led the committee approach that kept Tennessee’s run game afloat without Henry, signed with the Panthers in free agency.",
    "Brown, Robert Woods, Nick Westbrook-Ikhine\nDepth: Dez Fitzpatrick, Racey McMath, Josh Malone, Cody Hollister, Mason Kinsey\nThe wide receiver room was a major issue last season outside of Brown.",
    "Tight end\nProjected starter: Austin Hooper\nDepth: Geoff Swaim, Ryan Izzo, Tommy Hudson\nTight end was a significant concern until the Titans added Austin in free agency, a versatile No.",
    "Placekicker\nProjected starter: Randy Bullock\nDepth: n/a\nArmed with a new two-year deal, Bullock brought stability to the Titans’ kicking in 2021 after inconsistency in 2019 and 2020.",
    "Moore, Jamal Carter, Rodney Clemons\nThe Titans have one of the best starting safety tandems in the NFL with Byard, a two-time first-team All Pro, and Hooker, an ascending starter.",
    "There will be at least some concern with the depth here if Weaver, a 2021 fourth-rounder who broke his leg in Week 3 last season, doesn’t have a healthy second season.",
    "A 2021 second-rounder, Radunz had a disappointing rookie season and must make a big leap for an offensive line that’s going through big change.",
    "Murchison and Jones shore up the depth, though the Titans could benefit from the addition of another key contributor in the next two seasons.",
    "Adeniyi, known primarily as a special-teamer, brought more than expected pass-rush value last season, and that could continue.",
    "Long snapper\nProjected starter: Morgan Cox\nDepth: n/a\nCox has been one of the NFL’s best long snappers for the last few years.",
    "Defensive lineman Denico Autry, who tied a career-high nine sacks last season, also plays outside linebacker occasionally.",
    "But depth at the spot took a hit with the departure in free agency of Dane Cruikshank, who was the No.",
    "There should be a lot of comfort in the defensive front, which paced a defense that ranked No.",
    "For 2022, the level of uncertainty for the Tennessee Titans varies drastically by position.",

    "More receiver depth should be one of the Titans’ biggest priorities in the draft.",

    "Contact him at barthur@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter at @benyarthur.",
    "2 receiver – but he’ll be 30 next season, and he tore his ACL in November.",
    "Rice, a 2021 third-rounder, figures to take a step next season as a No.",
    "But then there are positions like cornerback which have some questions.",

    "His 83.9% field goal success rate ranked 21st in the NFL last season.",
    "Three weeks from the draft, how should we assess the Titans’ holes?",
    "Ben Arthur covers the Tennessee Titans for The USA TODAY Network.",
