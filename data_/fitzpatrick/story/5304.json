    "I did construction work, as a handyman.”\nThe group is also getting creative, offering the “Poi Dog Pondering / Private Concert Series,” where you can hire anything from just Orrall and his guitar ($950), to the full 13-member band, plus dancers and lights and a sound system ($22,000) for a no-holds barred backyard blowout.",
    "So while I generally avoid concerts (crowds, noise, expense) when I saw that Poi Dog was playing at SPACE in Evanston for a few days around New Year’s Eve, I began hinting to my wife that maybe we should uncurl from our protective fetal ball, rise up, step out and go enjoy some music.",
    "I called Frank Orrall, who wrote “Complicated,” and asked for permission to quote from it, beginning “Sorrow is an angel, that comes to you in blue light, and shows you what is wrong, just to see if you’ll set it right...”\n“Sure,” he said, or words to that effect.",

    "But I didn’t really grasp the reality until I found myself tumbling along, working on my last book, which uses literature to explain addiction and recovery.",
    "“Poi Dog has done house parties before, and I felt I needed to get creative so we can get out there until things open up again,” Orrall said.",
    "I found myself conducting negotiations in French, tracking down three different people who got together and wrote a song 30 years ago.",
    "Then I noticed that a few members of Poi Dog were providing musical backing to Tony Fitzpatrick reading at the Poetry Foundation.",
    "She was leery about jamming into SPACE, and the performances got canceled anyway as omicron raged across the world.",
    "Securing the rights from nearly 80 poets and novelists took over two years — longer than writing the book itself.",
    "I knew this intellectually, the way you know that falling down a rocky embankment would hurt.",
    "Poi Dog is trying again at SPACE, March 14, 15 and 16 as the group struggles to keep afloat.",
    "“Frank,” I said, “I need written permission.”\n“Sure,” he said, or words to that effect.",

    "“People are still nervous to be in a room with strangers.",
    "We love to dance, and get the crowd moving.”\n?????????",
    "There is no First Amendment when it comes to poetry.",
    "At intermission, I made a beeline to Orrall.",
    "I typed up a letter, and hurried over.",
