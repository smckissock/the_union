    "+2\nView gallery\nFitzpatrick (pictured) and the teen allegedly sparked a relationship together - and booked to go on a 200-mile trip from the home to Thorpe Park\nThe hearing was told he hid a recording device under a bed because he was suspicious she was seeing another person.",
    "Speaking at the hearing, Griffiths said: 'Over the past 17 months I have maintained professional boundaries and I have not let this distract me from my service of looking after young people.",
    "Jade Fitzpatrick, 26, sparked a relationship with the 17-year-old resident at the home, based in Wales, and communicated with him using a secret love language called 'jibba-jabba'.",
    "'It was more likely than not that her behaviour was sexually motivated - there is no other plausible explanation that explains the conduct that we have found proven'.",
    "A carer at a children's home is facing the sack after having a 'sexual relationship' with a 'vulnerable' teenage boy and wearing hot pants and a crop top to work.",
    "Mr Griffiths said Fitzpatrick was 'dishonest and lacking integrity' and her behaviour was an 'egregious breach of duty relating to a vulnerable young person'.",
    "Justin Davies, legal adviser to the panel, said he would have needed no assistance with being put to bed and there was no reason to close the door.",
    "'We recognise that there are a number of reasons why staff members would go into a young person's bedroom, however it would be with the door open.'",
    "Fitzpatrick, who worked for the Keys Childcare group, is now facing the sack after the panel found her actions amounted to serious misconduct.",
    "But concerns were raised about Fitzpatrick in August 2020 when the teenager damaged a car after becoming angry the trip had been called off.",
    "Presenting officer Graham Miles said Fitzpatrick made contact with the boy on social media and even sent a message saying 'I love you.'",
    "He said: 'Given the evidence, we are satisfied that Miss Fitzpatrick visited the young person at night with the door closed.",
    "'I have proven with regards to my character therefore that I am looking to the future and have learned from past mistakes.",
    "Her ex-partner Matthew Griffiths, who worked as a carer for another firm, also faced allegations of dishonest conduct.",
    "The Social Care Wales panel heard Fitzpatrick had visited the teenager in his bedroom at night 'on many occasions'.",
    "You were under a professional obligation to raise your concerns about the practise of another professional.'",
    "Fitzpatrick also visited his room at night with the door closed, a Fitness to Practice hearing heard.",
    "The pair had also booked to go on a 200-mile trip from the home to Thorpe Park to stay in a hotel.",
    "He played the recording to a colleague who agreed the noise 'sounded like two people having sex.'",
    "Griffiths was handed a warning that will stay on his record for three years.",
    "He added: 'The inappropriate nature of the relationship was plain to see.",
    "A decision on Fitzpatrick's sanctions will be announced at a later date.",
    "Legal advisor Mr Davies said: 'You failed to take appropriate action.",
    "This is not just a job for me, this is my life.'",
    "'This has been a massive learning curve for me."
