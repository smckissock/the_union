    "“On the foregoing basis, I request WorkSafe determine the AFL an unsafe workplace until such time as safe Return to Play Protocols and the multi-modality testing regimes and concussion passport are introduced.”\nWhile Jess continues to deal with WorkSafe, potential legal action could cease if the AFL introduces a multimillion-dollar insurance fund, which former players impacted by head knocks could tap into.",
    "In his letter to Josevski, Jess “alleges that at all relevant times the AFL, in breach of Section 23 of the Act, failed to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, that players in the AFL, AFLW and second-tier competitions were not exposed to risks to their health and safety arising from the unsafe Return to Play Protocols in conduct of the competitions.",

    "The AFL, however, has tightened its protocols considerably over the past decade, including introducing a minimum 12-day break for concussed players, and last year allowing teams on game day to replace an injured or concussed player.",
    "Sources say Josevski opened his investigation in September last year – there had been an earlier WorkSafe report on the AFL in 2020 – with Jess hoping the latest report ultimately lands with the Director of Public Prosecutions.",
