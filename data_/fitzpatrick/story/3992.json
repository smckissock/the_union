    "These are some of the conclusions of a historian who has researched the two years the Kelly Gang was on the run to tell the story of the police who eventually caught them.",

    "After what became known as 'the Fitzpatrick incident', Ned and Dan rode into the hills and were joined by their mates Steve Hart and Joe Byrne.",
    "Wallace had been a childhood friend of Byrne's who became a double-agent giving information to both sides of the law during the Kelly outbreak.",

    "McIntyre escaped to describe how his colleagues were slaughtered, but Kelly insisted until his death the police had come to kill him.",
    "'But in terms of who helped him actually turn it into a written document, who crafted it, you'd need someone who is highly literate.'",

    "On December 9 the gang held up a station near Euroa, taking all of its occupants hostage and cutting the town's telegraph wires.",
