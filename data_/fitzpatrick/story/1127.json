    "+4\nView gallery\nAnother unforgettable episode of the Tiger Woods legend is playing out at Augusta\nIt appeared for all the world it would end in a sad missed halfway cut — the first in 24 Masters appearances — when he ran up four bogeys in his first five holes and looked every bit the man who has had numerous operations and hadn’t played competitive golf for 506 long days.",
    "+4\nView gallery\nWorld No 1 Scottie Scheffler made his move over the back nine to take the halfway lead\n+4\nView gallery\nIrishman Shane Lowry prospered late as he compiled one of the rounds of the day\nWho better than the Irishman on a day when the capricious breezes turned a stringent test into an occasionally daunting one?",
    "Another to prosper late on was Shane Lowry, who compiled one of the rounds of the day with a 68 to move into a tie for second place with defending champion Hideki Matsuyama, South Korean Im Sung-jae and South African Charl Schwartzel.",
    "In the UK, of course, the fact he got his hands on a green jacket went largely unnoticed because everyone wanted to wrap their arms around 21-year-old Rory McIlroy, who had blown a four shot lead in the final round.",
    "+4\nView gallery\nAfter four bogeys through five, Woods looked as if he'd miss the cut but he battled back\nPerhaps an apology is in order at this juncture to those who delivered some sterling performances.",
    "For the final three hours of his second round he delivered a testament to sporting bravery and when it was all over, to the delight of 30,000 patrons, he was still standing heading into the weekend.",
    "‘What a thing of beauty we’ve been treated to over the last two days,’ said Sir Nick Faldo, on American television — and what treats we still have to savour this weekend.",
    "At some point here at the other National in focus this weekend you presume the narrative will turn and we’ll take in the other men who might win the 86th Masters.",
    "New world No 1 Scottie Scheffler leads by no fewer than five shots, for heaven’s sake, taking full advantage of the evening calm to post a wonderful 67.",
    "‘What else can go wrong?’ Woods said to himself, bending over in anguish as all the expectation built up on day one was replaced by a different emotion.",
    "As he made his way to the first tee, there were some last-minute stretching exercises, as if the exertions from the previous day had taken their toll.",
    "What a manful defence, too, from Matsuyama, who’s barely played recently owing to a bulging disc in his neck but has fought through the pain.",
    "Two days in however, it is quite clear we’re still some way from that point after another engrossing performance from the man who won’t quit.",
    "What we’re witnessing here is quite simply another unforgettable episode of the Tiger Woods legend, and who knows where it still might end.",
    "Scheffler made his move over the back nine with a series of authoritative strokes to birdie both the two par fives and the two par threes.",
    "Over the opening holes the crucial putts for pars that had disappeared below ground on Thursday were now stubbornly grazing the edges.",
    "Playing quite beautifully over the back nine, he overcame his early struggles to finish up with a 74 for a total of one over par.",
    "What a contrast to the atmosphere the previous day when the early starter Woods treated his audience to one of his great rounds.",
    "Naturally, he took full advantage of his good fortune with a lovely low pitch to 4ft for a birdie to right the ship once more.",
    "The main attraction emerged shortly after noon dressed in Seve blue, before removing his sweater to reveal a turquoise shirt.",
    "Among the players competing yesterday morning were such popular names as McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka.",
    "He will take some stopping as he goes in search of his fourth win in nine amazing weeks, and what would be his first major.",
    "Lowry actually began with a bogey but played superbly thereafter, before making his birdies when the wind dropped.",
    "His face was creased with irritation but it lifted when the ball came up fortuitously short of the creek.",
    "All round Augusta, there were few roars echoing through the pines, just groans as the bogeys piled up.",
    "So to the fabled back nine, the fabulous setting for so many of his incredible feats over the years.",
    "As the patrons awaited his arrival, it was rather like turning up at a concert for the warm-up act.",
    "Now 37, he opted to change the mood by watching some feelgood footage of his triumph here in 2011.",
    "It wasn’t long before it became all too apparent that this was to be a different type of round.",
    "It got off to a thrilling start, and one of those imperious iron shots stamped with greatness.",
    "Forgotten was Schwartzel’s sumptuous finish, with four birdies in a row to clinch his success.",
    "The 11th took the stroke back again, alas, and one more was spilled at the par three 12th.",
    "His second shot never had a hope of clearing Rae’s Creek, as he flared a five wood.",
    "Woods refocused and accepted the birdie opportunity at the 8th to ease the stress.",
    "From there to the house he was well-nigh perfect, to the delight of his army.",
    "Whoever thought that a battle against a missed cut could be this compelling?",
    "Talk about 36 holes to illustrate he is fully deserving of his status.",
    "Now the task was far more prosaic, but no less compelling for that.",
    "Now the sad fate of a first missed cut had become a grim prospect.",
    "It finished just 4ft from the hole and he tapped in for a birdie.",
    "The comeback of comebacks continues for two more blessed days.",
    "Far from a missed cut, he’s only four shots off second place!",
    "Here, his trip down memory lane worked a treat as he shot 69.",
    "‘Hey, a perfect lay-up!’ he said to his caddie, Joe LaCava.",
    "There was a lovely moment at the par five 13th.",
    "Three more at the third, fourth and fifth.",
    "It made no difference.",
    "One at the first.",
    "Isn’t he just."
