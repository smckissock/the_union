    "Those records, most of which have been kept under wraps by the committee as it prepares for public hearings, have included text messages as well as testimony demonstrating how Trump’s staff, family members, friends, and other White House officials or hangers-on—including those at Fox News—repeatedly begged him to quell the violence on Jan. 6 with little to no success.",
    "Investigators have said those messages offer insight into the sprawling pressure campaign to subvert the election that ensconced former Vice President Mike Pence and extended out to a wide cast of players including Trump’s personnel director to campaign aides to attorneys like John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell, and Rudy Giuliani, and others.",
    "Several critical findings have trickled out in the last year including text messages sent and received from former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to legislators like Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Ginni Thomas, the Q-anon conspiracy spewing wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.",
    "The transfer of Trump’s presidential records began in mid-January and by Feb. 10, early reporting on White House call logs obtained by the committee revealed that Trump’s habit of using personal cell phones or staff phones had left White House records riddled with new gaps for investigators to explore.",
    "Subpoenas have steadily flowed to a wide array of people both tangentially and overtly connected to Trump’s efforts to spread election disinformation, including those who submitted bogus electoral certificates on behalf of Trump in key election battleground states.",
    "Trump, she has maintained, ignored court rulings against his claims of widespread fraud and launched a “massive campaign to mislead the public.”\n“Our hearings will show that these falsehoods provoked the violence on Jan. 6,” she said in February.",
    "A meticulous review of the logs submitted by the National Archives continues and at least one investigator has aired concerns that a “possible coverup” of the official White House record from Jan. 6, 2021 was in place that very day.",
    "Trump’s defeat at the Supreme Court in a bid to stop the National Archives from transferring his presidential records to the probe has proven a boon for the committee as well as for overall transparency into the executive branch.",
    "From those who helped write Trump’s speech that incited the mob to those officials who waved alleged coup conspirators into meetings with Trump or his lackeys, the committee ramped up the pressure as it pursues accountability.",
    "Trump has endorsed Republican political candidates for the House and Senate at every turn as the midterms approach and there’s no sign that his push to install Trump-friendly legislators will stop anytime soon.",
    "From top to bottom, scrutiny by the probe has been intense as investigators have drawn in White House advisors, strategists, and aides of various ranks, opting to leave few if any stones unturned.",
    "This is a particularly curious development given that several lawmakers, including House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, have publicly stated they spoke to Trump before, during, and after the attack.",
    "Though he was once one of Trump’s most vocal champions, as Brooks launched a campaign to win a Senate seat, he’s tried to memory hole his promotion of Trump’s election fraud bunk.",
    "The committee is simultaneously exploring the scope of extremist elements behind Jan. 6 with a review of rallies and other pro-Trump events from before the Capitol attack.",
    "Prosecutors argue there was a well-funded, well-equipped, and organized scheme to stop the peaceful transfer of power among the extremist Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.",
    "The censure described Jan. 6 as “legitimate political discourse.”\nAs for Trump, he has unsurprisingly maintained the position that the 2020 election was stolen.",
    "The extremism analysis by the Jan. 6 Committee is split between two groups, with one group focused on the extremist-related events occurring just on Jan. 6.",
    "The gap has now prompted the committee to expand its investigation even further into the use of disposable or burner phones in the Trump White House.",
    "Unlike Brooks, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney—the vicechair of the committee who has paid steep political costs to join the probe—has been steadfast.",
    "The Republican National Committee formally censured the only two Republicans on the probe, Rep. Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.",
    "That would include the Million MAGA March attended by Proud Boys in November 2020 and the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally held that December.",
    "Those indictments have importantly come to include the first seditious conspiracy and conspiracy indictments tied to the attack.",
    "They say it was in place for several weeks and premised on the false belief espoused by Trump that he won the 2020 election.",
    "Records obtained thus far have corroborated huge chunks of public reporting about Trump’s conduct in the Oval on Jan. 6.",
    "Those who swear fealty to Trump and openly declare faith in conspiracies of election fraud receive priority treatment.",
    "Records showed a seven-hour gap in the White House call log extending from 11:17 am to 6:54 pm on Jan. 6.",
    "Nonetheless, in the last year, he has taken that line and used it as a litmus test for his endorsements.",
    "A striking example of this fall from Trump’s graces came recently from Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.",
    "As for the Justice Department, it has prosecuted over 725 people for crimes related to Jan. 6.",
    "Trump used the official phones before the riot, but once the violence exploded, he went dark.",
    "Over 550 interviews have been conducted by the select committee as of March.",
    "In March, a review of call logs by The Washington Post thickened that plot.",
    "Pushback from the right against the committee’s work has been unabated.",
    "The other group is reviewing events from before and after.",

    "It was not."
