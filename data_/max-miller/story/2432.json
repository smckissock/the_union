    "“Eric has always been a great Dad, who loves his boys and has always put them first, and that is why he is filing for full custody of his children.”\nProf. Greitens describes the ex-governor as becoming mentally unstable as his political fortunes unraveled, threatening to harm himself if she didn't publicly support him and implying that he might hurt the children if she didn't do what he asked.",
    "The professor also describes her ex-husband hiding a gun in the house, so that “multiple people other than myself were worried enough to intervene to limit Eric’s access to firearms.”\nAnd if all this sounds familiar, it's because Senate candidate Sean Parnell dropped out of the race in Pennsylvania in November after similar allegations of spousal and child abuse by his ex-wife.",
    "“I became afraid for my safety and that of our children at our home.”\nShe went on to describe “behavior [that] included physical violence toward our children, such as cuffing our then-3-year-old son across the face at the dinner table in front of me and yanking him around by his hair.”\nFor the record, Greitens denies the allegations.",
    "At one point, Eric Greitens made a reference to the fact that he had the children — and she didn’t — while trying to persuade Sheena Greitens to delete emails she had sent to the family therapist seeking help, according to the affidavit.",
    "“Prior to our divorce, during an argument in late April 2018, Eric knocked me down and confiscated my cell phone, wallet and keys so that I was unable to call for help or extricate myself and our children from our home,” she wrote.",
    "Not to be confused with Herschel Walker in Georgia, whose ex-wife alleged pervasive abuse during their marriage, including having him hold a gun to her head and threatening to \"blow her fucking brains out.\"",
    "This is, after all, the guy who had to resign as governor after a woman accused him of tying her up and taking her photograph as potential blackmail material if she told anyone about their affair.",
    "Prof. Greitens, a China expert who relocated to Austin where she teaches at the University of Texas, did manage to extricate herself and her children from the marriage.",
    "But the AP got its hands on an affidavit filed by Greitens's ex-wife Sheena Greitens in the custody dispute over their two children, and it is really, really ugly.",
    "But he is being represented by Don Jr.'s ladyfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, who does not appear to have commented on the latest AP allegations as yet.",
    "Or Max Miller, a congressional candidate in Ohio, who White House comms flack Stephanie Grisham alleges abused her during their relationship.",
    "“His ex-wife is engaged in a last-ditch attempt to vindictively destroy her ex-husband,” the candidate's spokesman Dylan Johnson told the AP.",
    "But now her ex-husband is seeking custody of the children, and she's alleging a shocking pattern of abuse at the end of their relationship.",
    "“Eric threatened to accuse me of child abuse if I did not delete the emails and convince the therapist to delete them,” she wrote.",
    "It's not like the GOP would nominate someone credibly accused of abuse by multiple women for a Senate candidacy, would they?",
    "Unlike Parnell, Walker, and Miller, though, Greitens hadn't yet secured Trump's endorsement before shit hit the fan.",
    "Sen. Josh Hawley, who had already endorsed Rep. Vicky Hartzler, is calling for him to drop out.",
    "It remains to be seen whether this will be the nail in Greitens's political coffin.",
    "You already knew Missouri's US Senate hopeful Eric Greitens was garbage.",
    "And if you're ordering from Amazon, use this link, because reasons.",
    "Notably, Hawley has not called for Walker or Miller to drop out.",
    "Click the widget to keep your Wonkette ad-free and feisty.",
    "Select an amount (USD)\n$2$25$5$50$10$100$15$500$20$1000",
    "But surely Greitens will GTFO now, right?",
    "How often would you like to donate?",
    "LOL."
