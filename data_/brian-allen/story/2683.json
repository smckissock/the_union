    "Researchers discovered that Australia's \"Black Summer\" wildfires in late 2019 and early 2020 created a cloud of smoke so large that it rose into the stratosphere, circled the southern hemisphere, and triggered a chain of chemical reactions that destroyed ozone.",
    "Australia had the first 'super outbreak' of fire-driven thunderstorms\n In this photo taken with a drone provided by the Bootleg Fire Incident Command, a pyrocumulus cloud is seen over the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon, on July 14, 2021.",
    "The smoke was associated with a 1% decrease in ozone at southern midlatitudes in March 2020, according to calculations in one of the studies, published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
    "\"This field of research into pyroCbs and their effects is relatively new, especially compared to other types of wildfire impacts,\" Peterson said, adding, \"We learn a lot, but then we get a lot of new questions.\"",
    "RAMMB/CIRA/CSU; Business Insider\n\"Smoke was not supposed to do this,\" Peter Bernath, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Waterloo, who co-authored one of the studies and led the other, told Insider.",
    "You need a certain atmospheric condition that allows for the thunderstorm to develop,\" Peterson said, adding, \"Just because you have more wildfires doesn't necessarily mean you'll get more pyroCbs.",
    "In the 1980s, researchers discovered that a class of household chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were eating a hole in the ozone layer, which protects Earth from cancer-causing radiation.",
    "More than half of those clouds reached the stratosphere, according to research led by David Peterson, a meteorologist who studies pyrocumulonimbus clouds at the Naval Research Laboratory.",
    "\"The smoke particles have a reactive surface, and that surface catalyzes this chemistry that destroys the ozone,\" Bernath said, adding, \"So we kind of know what the smoke is doing.",
    "They think that the hydrated, acidic surface of the smoke particles triggers chemical reactions that wouldn't otherwise take place in the stratosphere, creating new compounds.",

    "Researchers aren't sure how the smoke causes an increase in these reactive compounds, but they are confident that this is what caused the ozone levels to dip in March 2020.",
    "But the researchers suspect that other major wildfire events, like the 2017 and 2020 blazes across the Pacific Northwest, could have a similar ozone-depleting effect.",
    "Nancy and Brian Allen stand outside the house as high winds push smoke and ash from the Currowan Fire towards Nowra, New South Wales, Australia, on January 4, 2020.",
    "Now the ozone layer is on track to fully recover by 2060, according to a scientific assessment from the United Nations and the World Meteorological Association.",
    "Smoke cools and expands as it quickly rises miles high, allowing water vapor to condense on the ash particles and create a cloud sitting atop the smoke column.",
    "It's unclear how often fires will shoot ozone-destroying smoke into the stratosphere\n Wildfire smoke rises from burning forests in Canada on August 12, 2021.",
    "World governments banded together to phase CFCs out of household products, like refrigerators and hairspray, when they signed the Montreal Protocol in 1987.",
    "In recent global climate and wildfire reports, the United Nations warned that fires will become more frequent and more severe as global temperatures rise.",
    "Laboratory research that inserts smoke particles into a stratosphere-like environment, and documents ensuing chemical reactions, could fill in the blanks.",
    "Pesquet\nPyrocumulonimbus clouds that reach into the stratosphere could become more common as the climate warms, but for now, that's hard to forecast.",
    "A 10% decrease in ozone levels would result in an additional 300,000 skin-cancer cases worldwide, according to a World Health Organization estimate.",
    "The second study found that the smoke led to a rise in compounds, like hypochlorous acid, which react with ozone molecules to break them apart.",
    "\"As severe wildfires increase in number, they will play an increasingly important role in the global ozone budget,\" Bernath's study concludes.",
    "Drone footage shows aftermath of tornadoes, storms, and high winds\nTornadoes and storms ripped through southern US states on March 22nd, 2022.",
    "REUTERS/Tracey Nearmy\nWithin about nine months, the smoke had cleared from the stratosphere, and ozone had recovered to pre-wildfire levels.",
    "\"That's why we refer to it as the first pyroCb super outbreak,\" Peterson, who is not affiliated with the new studies on ozone, told Insider.",
    "Copernicus EMS; Sentinel 2/ESA\nBernath and his colleagues aren't even sure how wildfire smoke leads to compounds that react with ozone.",

    "NSW Rural Fire Service/Handout via Reuters\nThat's what happened above Australia in the final months of 2019 and beginning of 2020.",
    "One percent may sound small, but it's significant, considering the ozone layer is rebuilding itself by about 1-3% every decade.",
    "The fires below fuel hot updrafts that sustain the thunderstorm and funnel smoke into the upper atmosphere, like a chimney.",
    "As fires consumed about 50 million acres of land, they created about 38 pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which persisted for days.",
