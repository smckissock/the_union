    "“What’s also unique is going into a market where the NFL hasn’t been very active and seeing early returns from that time and energy.”\nBentley praised the Giants’ scouting department for “turning over all the rocks to see what’s out there” and the NFL for “expanding the footprint of what’s possible discovering talent around the globe.”\nUgboaja said Mbaeteka is going to blow the Giants away with how quickly he learns from them, too.",
    "That’s why The Uprise becomes the future they can see now.”\nDEVELOPMENT: A TEAM EFFORT\nDamani Leech, the COO of NFL International, said the league’s placement of the Nigerian players at Bentley’s Arizona facility — rather than the previous host, Florida’s IMG Academy — was the product of development discussions with the NFL’s competition committee last year.",
    "“You’re still dealing with the logistics of travel and getting it in front of the right people, making sure they get it processed.”\nOnce they landed in Arizona, Bentley, a senior NFL advisor on player performance and development, said his lead performance coach Davis turned Mbaeteka’s lack of experience with organized football into a positive.",
    "He wanted to make sure education was never an impediment to success.”\nMbaeteka was born in Nigeria’s Anambra state, in the city of Onitsha, and moved with his family at a young age to Benin City, in Edo state, where he grew up in a “small house.” He has four siblings: an older sister and three younger brothers.",
    "I felt really bad about it, and I told my mom and she said she’d do everything she could to make sure I got better.”\nSo his mother found an English teacher to give her son extra lessons, while Roy scoured foreign movies to reinforce his knowledge and learn more.",
    "“When we first got the news of Roy’s signing, I sent emails and started ticking off all the people involved, from Will Bryce guiding the program [as head of football development for NFL international] to Ken Edmonds in the D.C. office,” Leech said.",
    "Umenyiora said “I still have to pinch myself,” however, “to fully understand the gravity of what has transpired.”\n“Ya know, Roy, Kenny, they were living in a situation where they didn’t know what tomorrow was gonna bring,” Umenyiora said.",
    "And before I knew it I was signing a contract.”\nMbaeteka signed a three-year, $2.56 million contract that guarantees $207,000 of his 2022 salary, indicating the Giants plan to carry him on their practice squad this year at least.",
    "So every day we were able to cover positive ground.”\nCurrent NFL linemen like Alex Cappa (Bengals), Justin Herron (Patriots), Isaiah Prince (Bengals), Brian Allen (Rams), Taylor Decker (Lions) also train at Bentley’s facility.",
    "SPEAK IT INTO EXISTENCE\nTwo-time Pro Bowl lineman LeCharles Bentley oversaw the Nigerians’ 10-week training regimen from January to March at his LB O-Line Performance facility in Chandler, Ariz. Roy started with the basics.",

    "That’s part of what drove the interest in the three Nigerian players.”\nLeech and Ken Edmonds, the NFL’s VP of Government Affairs, played pivotal roles in getting the players to the United States in January, too.",
    "It’s a crazy experience.”\nMbaeteka, 22, said the flight to America was surreal alongside teammates Haggai Chisom Ndubuisi, another offensive lineman, and Kehinde (Kenny) Oginni Hassan, a defensive lineman.",
    "The players didn’t know proper techniques, but “the way he moved, his competitiveness, his fire, that’s what stood out to me.”\nAnd no, the great Giants pass rusher did not test Mbaeteka himself.",
    "“And when I got to the Giants and they started asking the same basic questions, I’m like, ‘OK, if this is it, then I’m probably ready to blow you out of the water, man!” he said with a laugh.",
    "Even when “Roy” and two teammates were flying to the United States in January as standouts of the NFL’s International Pathway Program, they still couldn’t believe this opportunity was real.",
    "As he stretched afterwards, O-line coach Bobby Johnson was one of many coaches to tell him: ‘Good job, Roy, I’m impressed.’”\n“Everybody wanted to know what college I went to,” he laughed.",
    "Bentley and Davis also took their players to a local high school one day to observe younger players being taught basic concepts to give them confidence they could learn it themselves.",

    "He was training for the inaugural May 2021 football camp of The Uprise program co-founded by Ugboaja and Giants legend Osi Umenyiora, whom Ugboaja calls “a messiah” to these boys.",

    "Ejike Ugboaja, a Nigerian basketball player and former Cleveland Cavaliers draft pick, cried tears of joy when the Giants signed offensive tackle Chigbo Roy Mbaeteka on April 8.",

    "The Philadelphia Eagles hit the jackpot in 2018 by drafting Australian tackle Jordan Mailata in the seventh round, though, ahead of his placement on someone else’s roster.",
    "“I tried to hang out with them, and one day one of the young ones said my parents don’t like me hanging out with you because she thinks your Igbo is ruining our English.",
    "But his journey to signing a contract with the Giants is a success story in itself, and it’s a credit to a lot of people who were determined to make a positive impact.",
    "“I used to see cartoons, Disney movies like “The Lion King.” I remember watching “Titanic.” I remember I did cry, but I was also trying to learn the words,” he joked.",
    "From that group, 13 players from nine countries earned the opportunity to train in the United States and compete for spots in the International Pathway Program.",
    "He bought and acquired uniforms, arranged sponsorships for more gear, helped found NFL Africa, and then co-founded The Uprise football program with Ugboaja.",
    "“There was this family that moved in from Lagos, the bigger city, so the kids had better command of English, and when they came in, they were the cool kids.",
    "“So I called him out and said, ‘Switch to go play football.’ He said, ‘No, I love basketball.’ I said, ‘No, you’re not gonna play basketball in this camp.",
    "If anybody would have told me then you may not come back from this…”\nUgboaja met Umenyiora during his final NFL season with the Atlanta Falcons in 2014.",

    "That’s where Giants scout Jeremy Breit saw Mbaeteka and, unbeknownst even to Umenyiora, set the wheels in motion for Roy’s biggest break.",
    "Davis said all of the Nigerians “retained information” at a high rate and were diligent doing their take-home “homework” every night.",
    "We then did the rest of the playbook in three weeks.”\n“I think I understood it as quick as they were putting it up,” Mbaeteka said.",
    "It’s crazy.”\n“A lot of times in America you take the country for granted,” he added, “but these guys are coming from real struggle.",
    "He called Mbaeteka “the leader of the pack.”\nDavis concentrated on teaching them concepts rather than specific plays or positions.",
    "Bentley and Davis had a target date to have their players ready: March 14, for an international player showcase at Arizona State.",
    "Umenyiora said the Nigerian players at first were refused visas, and Leech and Edmonds straightened it out with the U.S. embassy.",
    "But Umenyiora said at his April 7 Giants tryout, Mbaeteka blew the team away with his understanding of football’s X’s and O’s.",
    "He quickly realized there were more football scholarships available in the U.S. and added a concurrent football camp in 2009.",
    "You see boys hucking waters just to eat.”\nMbaeteka spoke his Igbo tribal language as a child while he was learning English.",

    "“Thank God for Osi,” said Ugboaja, who has 17 athletes living with him, plus another 45 in separate housing as they train.",
    "If I start working out, it might start to seem real.’ No one had ever given me a chance to do anything this big before.",
    "The preemptive signings of these players are major developments, especially in the infancy of these NFL Africa efforts.",
    "If he’d known he was taking his first step to leaving Nigeria for the United States, it might have been too daunting.",
    "Amazingly, Umenyiora, who was born in London to parents of Nigerian descent, is a native of the town of Ogbunike.",
    "And to go from that to you’re playing and signing a contract with the New York Giants within a couple of months?",
    "“The Giants took him to the board, asked him to draw up what he knew, and he knew the schemes,” Umenyiora said.",
    "I’m 6-9 on a good day!”\nHe’s not the only one of the Nigerians who has earned an NFL contract quickly, either.",
    "The entire trajectory of their lives has changed.”\nHe thinks Roy can help change the Giants’ trajectory, too.",
