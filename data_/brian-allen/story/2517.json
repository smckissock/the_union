    "The first week of free agency brought surprises, both good and bad, to Baltimore: a playmaking safety, Marcus Williams, signed to a long-term contract; the arrival of two mammoth starting linemen, right tackle Morgan Moses and defensive tackle Michael Pierce; and a disappearing deal with another former Raven, outside linebacker Za’Darius Smith.",
    "But as the pool of free agent dwindles, 90-man rosters take shape and next month’s draft approaches, DeCosta will have to decide where to focus the Ravens’ team-building efforts.",
    "General manager Eric DeCosta was never expected to patch up the holes in the Ravens’ roster during the first wave of free agency, or even by the second or third wave.",
    "Will he spend to fill a need in free agency, or does a rookie offer better value for a franchise with Super Bowl aspirations?",
    "The team has 10 picks in the NFL draft, including four in the top 100, and salary cap constraints.",
    "Here’s a look at where the Ravens can turn at five key positions.",
    "Ravens officials must spend what capital they have wisely."
