    "195 overall pick in the 2018 draft out of Rutgers, Joseph-Day became an instant hole plugger for the middle of the Rams’ trenches:\nOne other signature play from this past season: Joseph-Day fighting off this block from 2021 Pro Bowler and 2020 Super Bowl champ with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Ryan Jensen, who recently signed a blockbuster three-year, $39 million deal to stay with T.B.",
    "The Huge Losses on the Rams’ Side\nVeteran Sebastian Joseph-Day, who went from sixth rounder to starter and was someone putting together a career-best season before losing the rest of his 2021 to a pectoral injury, will remain in L.A. but is expected to sign with the Chargers, first reported by the NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.",
    "Significance & Impact of Both Losses\nBoth the 6-foot-4, 310-pound Joseph-Day and the 6-foot-4, 306-pound Corbett were unrestricted free agents heading into the free agency period — which officially launched on Monday with the start of the league’s tampering period.",
    "On a day the Los Angeles Rams locked away three crucial members of their trenches, the Super Bowl champions are now set to lose two valuable assets from their line of scrimmage — making both the first members who won’t be able to “run it back” with the franchise.",
    "For Joseph-Day, he was averaging 5.4 tackles per game including 3.28 solo stops and hit a career-high for sacks with three in seven games played — all those stats coming before his injury following the 28-19 home win over the Detroit Lions on October 24.",
    "As for Corbett, his market and value began to increase following the news of Laken Tomlinson of the San Francisco 49ers leaving his team to solidify the offensive line with the New York Jets, with Tomlinson set to sign for $40 million.",
    "Per Mike Garafolo of the NFL Network, Corbett’s deal is expected to hit $29.25 million for three years, making him the second-highest paid guard for this current 2022 free agent cycle.",
    "Rapoport says “Bash” will receive a financial elevation by earning $24 million with $15 million guaranteed — far different from the $2.6 million he once received from the Rams.",
    "Though he played a less scrutinized and glorified position on the Rams, Corbett still brought a needed nastiness to the front line for Matthew Stafford and company.",
    "And just four days ago, the Chargers secured a monster trade that lured six-time Pro Bowler and 2016 NFL Defensive Player of the Year winner Khalil Mack to L.A.",
    "Prized cornerback J.C. Jackson, formerly of the New England Patriots, signed a huge five-year, $82.5 million deal per ESPN’s Adam Schefter on Monday.",
    "Nearly an hour before, ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported that the Carolina Panthers were closing in on a deal to lure in the right guard Austin Corbett.",
    "With Brian Allen, Joe Noteboom and Coleman Shelton resigning with the champs, it’s the latter who is projected to slide into Corbett’s vacated spot.",
    "The 6-foot-1, 312-pounder took over for “Bash” and went on to produce career best numbers across the board while starting in 13 games for the Rams.",
    "— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) March 15, 2022\n“Bash” joined a growing list of aggressive moves that have been made by the Rams’ neighbors.",
    "He also showed an aggressive first punch that helped clear out his blocking assignment, which Panther fans will gladly welcome.",
    "Gaines still has another year left on his current contract and becomes an unrestricted free agent for 2023 when he turns 26.",
    "With three key signings along the offensive line, the Rams may not be in a hurry to find the replacement for Corbett.",
    "If anything, the Rams could still use the March period or next months draft to continue to add depth along the line.",
    "“Bash” was on pace for 91 tackles, 55 solo stops and seven sacks — which all would have set personal bests for him.",
    "And the soon-to-be free agent losses came within not even an hour’s time from each other on Monday, March 14.",
    "The move will reunite Joseph-Day with his former defensive coordinator in Chargers head coach Brandon Staley.",
    "Ram fans may likely remember him for dominating multiple Pro Bowler Ndamukong Suh in their Week 3 contest.",
    ":\nJoseph-Day posted his own happy dance following the announcement of his upcoming Chargers deal.",
    "Former #Rams DT Sebastian Joseph-Day is expected to sign with the #Chargers, source said.",
    "Corbett’s name was also highly thought of among free agent offensive guards.",
    "Joseph-Day is another who already has his replacement in place: Greg Gaines.",
    "But the nose tackle isn’t the only early significant loss for the Rams.",
    "But both provided a valuable impact at their spots when called upon.",
    "Sebastian Joseph-Day walks out to the field with Austin Corbett (No.",
    "63) before the Rams' September 26 home win over the Buccaneers.",
    "He gets a 3-year deal worth $24M with $15M fully guaranteed.",
    "Once he arrived to the Rams as a No.",
    "Who do the Rams Turn to Now?",
    "LAC doing work."
