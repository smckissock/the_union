    "DeCosta said team officials had pegged this offseason as one when they would “have to find some more young guys.” That doesn’t mean the Ravens won’t try to re-sign the 35-year-old Campbell — he was one of the NFL’s higher-rated interior linemen, according to Pro Football Focus, and regularly drew double teams — but Williams’ likely exit after nine years in Baltimore would leave a big hole at nose tackle.",
    "If San Diego State’s Matt Araiza is still on the board in the sixth round, though, the Ravens might be tempted to take the prospect known as the “Punt God.”\n()\nMost Popular\nCape Cod great white shark detections surpass 150,000 last year, hitting all-time high for the 6th straight year",
    "The Ravens could be tempted to target the position early in the draft — Georgia’s Nakobe Dean and Utah’s Devin Lloyd are first-round talents — but all eyes this week will be on Bobby Wagner, an eight-time Pro Bowl selection with the Seattle Seahawks and recent salary cap casualty.",
    "… I think we’ll have enough salary cap room to do everything we need to do, to do responsible, good deals that work for the club but also work for the player.”\nThe Ravens have obvious needs across their roster, both big (defensive line) and small (wide receiver).",

    "There’s little financial benefit to releasing Boyle, who will have another offseason to strengthen his knee and try to regain the form that made him one of the offense’s most important pieces.",
    "Queen fared better at weak-side linebacker after moving over from the middle last season, suggesting that the former first-round pick would fare better with a cerebral thumper next to him.",

    "Running back\nReturners: J.K. Dobbins, Gus Edwards, Justice Hill, Ty’Son Williams, Nate McCrary\nFree agents: Latavius Murray, Devonta Freeman\nWhat they need: Healthy knees.",
    "But if Averett, Young and Smith all leave, the team will need considerable help at a position where even the usually durable Peters and Humphrey are minor question marks.",
