    "Wide Receiver\nIn the Market: Jaguars, Browns, Falcons, Bills, Bears, Lions, Packers, Texans, Colts, Chiefs, Chargers, Raiders, Dolphins, Patriots, Saints, Jets\nTop of the Class: Allen Robinson II\nExpected Deal Value: $17 million/year\nIt’s impossible to quantify the impact of Robinson’s deteriorating relationship with the Bears coaching staff on his 2021 season.",
    "Edge Rusher\nIn the Market: Falcons, Browns, Broncos, Lions, Texans, Colts, Jaguars, Chiefs, Vikings, Giants, Eagles, Seahawks, Titans\nTop of the Class: Von Miller\nExpected Deal Value: $18 million/year\nMiller’s slow start with the Rams was immediately forgotten after a dominant postseason run, which culminated in a two-sack performance in L.A.’s Super Bowl win.",
    "Offensive Tackle\nIn the Market: Panthers, Bears, Cowboys, Texans, Colts, Dolphins, Saints, Steelers, Seahawks\nTop of the Class: Terron Armstead\nExpected Deal Value: $22 million/year\nArmstead is an elite blindside protector, but there’s a reason the cash-strapped Saints let him hit free agency: He can’t stay healthy.",
    "Quarterback\nIn the Market: Panthers, Steelers, Colts, Saints, Texans, Seahawks, Commanders\nTop of the Class: Jameis Winston\nExpected Deal Value: $10 million/year\nDuring the 2021 season, 37 quarterbacks attempted at least 200 dropbacks and only one produced a higher EPA per play than Jameis Winston, per RBSDM.com.",
    "Linebacker\nIn the Market: Panthers, Cowboys, Broncos, Lions, Texans, Jaguars, Rams, Chargers, Raiders, Patriots, Giants, Jets, Eagles, Commanders\nTop of the Class: De’Vondre Campbell\nExpected Deal Value: $10 million/year\nThe Packers put a lot on Campbell last season and he answered the call almost every week.",
    "Interior Offensive Line\nIn the Market: Cardinals, Falcons, Panthers, Bears, Bengals, Cowboys, Packers, Jaguars, Rams, Dolphins, Vikings, Giants, Seahawks, 49ers, Buccaneers, Titans\nTop of the Class: Ryan Jensen\nExpected Deal Value: $14 million/year\nJensen might be the league’s biggest instigator.",
    "He’s not nearly as impactful a defender as he was during his first season in Kansas City—he’s forced just four incompletions since 2020 after forcing seven in 2019, per Pro Football Focus—and the Chiefs cut his snaps lined up in the slot by about 16 percentage points last year.",
    "Sure, things didn’t end well in Tennessee after he was replaced by Ryan Tannehill—who immediately brought the Titans offense to new heights—but the last time he got extended playing time, Mariota had nerve issues that risked permanent damage to his throwing arm.",
    "Interior Defensive Line\nIn the Market: Ravens, Bills, Browns, Cowboys, Texans, Colts, Chargers, Raiders, Buccaneers\nTop of the Class: Akiem Hicks\nExpected Deal Value: $9 million/year\nAt his peak, Hicks is the ideal interior defensive lineman in today’s game.",
    "Buyer Beware: Orlando Brown Jr.\nExpected Deal Value: $20 million/year\nThe Chiefs traded a first-round pick to get Brown in 2021, and the fact that they’re letting him walk a year later tells you everything you need to know about his season-long performance.",
    "Buyer Beware: Marquez Valdes-Scantling\nExpected Deal Value: $12 million/year\nWith the free-agent-receiver group thinning out even before the legal tampering period, Valdes-Scantling’s value could inflate to the point that he’s pulling in high-end no.",
    "He isn’t the smoothest mover in coverage, and he attacks the line of scrimmage recklessly at times, but the 30-year-old’s strength in the run game and usefulness as a blitzer will make him an attractive option for a smart defensive coordinator.",
    "Safety\nIn the Market: Ravens, Lions, Texans, Jaguars, Saints, Jets, Eagles, Commanders\nTop of the Class: Marcus Williams\nExpected Deal Value: $16 million/year\nA decade ago, Williams might have been considered the top free agent in this class.",
    "It’s fair to ask whether Miller can still be dominant week after week due to his age and history of significant injuries, but he’s clearly capable of taking over a game—especially if he gets help from a creative defensive coordinator.",
    "There’s something for everyone in this group: Conner will do the dirty work, Edmonds is a big-play threat, and Gordon remains a starting caliber player whose reputation took too big of a hit after his failed holdout with the Chargers.",
    "Tight End\nIn the Market: Texans, Jaguars, Titans, Packers\nTop of the Class: Rob Gronkowski\nExpected Deal Value: $10 million/year\nGronkowski is washed up, but a washed Gronk is still better than 95 percent of the tight ends in the NFL.",
    "Trubisky did play fairly well down the stretch of the 2020 season to help lead the Bears to the playoffs, but Matt Nagy’s coaching staff had to strip down the offense to its bare bones in order to coax that performance out of him.",
    "Best Value: Odell Beckham Jr.\nExpected Deal Value: $6 million/year\nA torn ACL will complicate Beckham’s first foray into free agency, but a smart team (with a good medical staff) should take a chance on the mercurial receiver.",
    "Buyer Beware: Cordarrelle Patterson\nExpected Deal Value: $7 million/year\nWatching Patterson finally emerge as a do-it-all threat in Atlanta was fun as hell, but I have to ask: Does he get all those touches on a good team?",
    "Cornerback\nIn the Market: Cardinals, Falcons, Bears, Bengals, Broncos, Lions, Texans, Jaguars, Chiefs, Rams, Chargers, Raiders, Vikings, Patriots, Jets, Eagles, Steelers, Seahawks, 49ers … basically, the entire league.",
    "Secondary Market: Teddy Bridgewater, Andy Dalton, Ryan Fitzpatrick\nYou won’t find any viable starting options here, but any team that’s worried about its backup situation should at least consider some of these vets.",
    "Every defense was looking for their own version of Earl Thomas at the time—a rangy center-field safety who could eliminate throws to the deep middle—and Williams is one of the premier free safeties in today’s game.",
    "Best Value: Melvin Ingram III\nExpected Deal Value: $9 million/year\nYou’d think NFL teams would have learned their lesson after letting Kansas City acquire Ingram for pennies in return at the last trade deadline.",
    "Now, I’m not saying Winston is one of the better quarterbacks in the league—we’re talking about a half-season sample size here, and one just two years removed from a campaign in which he threw 30 interceptions.",
    "The fact that he was able to earn Brady’s trust early on should draw the attention of teams with young quarterbacks who aren’t ready to handle pass-protection calls—and I can’t overstate how much that matters.",
    "Secondary Market: James Conner, Chase Edmonds, Sony Michel, Melvin Gordon, Marlon Mack\nAny team that misses out on Penny should skip past the bigger names and try to land one of these backs on a modest deal.",
    "Running Back\nIn the Market: Cardinals, Seahawks, Texans, Falcons\nTop of the Class: Leonard Fournette\nExpected Deal Value: $7 million/year\nTom Brady deserves a percentage of whatever deal Fournette signs.",
    "Buyer Beware: Chandler Jones\nExpected Deal Value: $17 million/year\nJones’s dominant five-sack performance in Week 1 inflated his 2021 stat line and may be enough to help earn him another massive payday.",
    "But now, with the usage of two-high coverages on the rise, teams are looking for defensive backs who can offer more versatility, and it remains to be seen whether the 25-year-old can provide that.",
    "Buyer Beware: Mitchell Trubisky\nExpected Deal Value: $15 million/year\nTrubisky has been one of the hottest names of the offseason, which is kind of weird because, well … he’s Mitchell Trubisky.",
    "Robinson’s contested catch rate dropped to 33.3 percent in 2021, per Pro Football Focus, after he caught 53.3 percent of his contested targets in the first three seasons of his time in Chicago.",
    "But teams looking to improve their pass rush should take a patient approach to free agency and hope that one of these dudes will slip through the cracks and end up settling for a cheaper deal.",
    "Secondary Market: Emmanuel Ogbah, Randy Gregory, Haason Reddick, Jadeveon Clowney, Jerry Hughes, Justin Houston\nA lot of these guys will get paid, so don’t expect to find any bargains here.",
    "Whether you’re looking for a coverage guy who can hang on the outside (Hayward and Ward) or a player who can work in the slot (Nelson and Reed), there is a little something for everyone.",
    "He’s impossible to shake in man coverage and, after working with Belichick, the second-team All-Pro selection has a good understanding of whatever genre of coverage you ask him to play.",
    "Now, the former Jets safety—who played under the franchise tag a year ago—is expected to take a cheap-but-incentive-heavy deal, making him one of the better values of this class.",
    "Penny was impossible to tackle in 2021—he forced 27 missed tackles through the last six games of the season—and he ran away from defensive backs when he got into the open field.",
    "Best Value: Carlton Davis\nExpected Deal Value: $16 million/year\nDavis may not be a lockdown corner, but he’s capable of surviving when tasked with shadowing a star receiver.",
    "Hill’s a run stuffer first and foremost who may never be a star, but he can disrupt the pocket every now and then, and every good defensive line has a player like him on it.",
    "Best Value: Connor Williams\nExpected Deal Value: $8 million/year\nWilliams looked like a weak link on the Cowboys’ formidable line last year, which might suppress his market.",
    "Buyer Beware: Brandon Scherff\nExpected Deal Value: $15 million/year\nScherff is a nasty run blocker who’d be a perennial Pro Bowl candidate if he could just stay healthy.",
    "It’s just that a deal for him will be very expensive, and there are some options in this next group who have been just as productive—if not more so—in recent campaigns.",
    "Hill\nExpected Deal Value: $7 million/year\nThe Bengals swung a midseason trade for Hill last year and he was instantly one of the most important players on the defense.",
    "Secondary Market: Quandre Diggs, Jayron Kearse, Devin McCourty, Jordan Whitehead, Justin Reid, Kareem Jackson\nThis class of safeties offers a little bit of everything.",
    "Secondary Market: Leighton Vander Esch, Dont’a Hightower, Foyesade Oluokun, Josey Jewell\nSigning one of these guys would be like stopping for food at the gas station.",
    "The numbers suggest that Brown’s play dipped in 2021, but he was blocking for two quarterbacks who hold onto the ball for an eternity (Russell Wilson and Geno Smith).",
    "If you’re paying nearly $20 million a year for a safety, you’re looking for versatility, and Mathieu is having more and more trouble providing that as he gets older.",
    "Brady essentially willed the one-dimensional back into being a productive player on passing downs, sending 84 targets his way in 2021—third most among running backs.",
    "But smarter teams will see that his production steadily declined as the season wore on, and that it’s been two years since he played at least 900 snaps in a season.",
    "Buyer Beware: Bobby Wagner\nExpected Deal Value: $10 million/year\nSeattle’s release of Wagner last week added some star power to this year’s class of linebackers.",
    "Johnson is the type of linebacker who has thrived under Bill Belichick, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if New England throws money at him early on in free agency.",
    "But it looks as if Ingram could be overshadowed by bigger names (with bigger price tags) this month and find himself taking less money to play for a contender.",
    "But those targets weren’t very efficient: Fournette finished 101st in receiving EPA among running backs despite the high usage rate, per Sports Info Solutions.",
    "Even if the 32-year-old runs like your dad, he still catches everything thrown his way and barrels over defensive backs trying to tackle him in the open field.",
    "Ingram is no longer capable of wreaking havoc on his own—hence the lack of interest—but he can act as a force multiplier for a talented group of pass rushers.",
    "The former undrafted free agent missed 11 games through the past two seasons and has never made it through a full season without missing at least one game.",
    "Secondary Market: James Daniels, Andrew Norwell, Ben Jones, Austin Corbett, Brian Allen\nBehind Daniels, there isn’t a clear long-term option in this group.",
    "A team might regret giving the veteran a long-term contract, but a low-risk, short-term deal makes sense for any franchise that fancies itself a contender.",
    "Using cheaper vets to fill in holes along the offensive line has been a useful strategy for contending teams in recent years, so don’t sleep on this group.",
    "On top of traditional tight end skills, Uzomah has the ability to produce after the catch, making him one of the more well-rounded players at the position.",
    "After last year’s midseason signing with Los Angeles, Beckham showed he can still stretch the field and isn’t afraid to make tough catches over the middle.",
    "Secondary Market: Trent Brown, Eric Fisher, Riley Rieff, Morgan Moses\nEach guy on this list has a clear strength to his game, but also a glaring weakness.",
    "Buyer Beware: Stephon Gilmore\nExpected Deal Value: $14 million/year\nThe lower body injuries continue to pile up for the 2019 Defensive Player of the Year.",
    "Best Value: Duane Brown\nExpected Deal Value: $12 million/year\nYou can’t overpay for good pass protection, and, even at 36, Brown can still provide that.",
    "He held up just fine in that role—and even if Campbell isn’t the most fluid mover, he’s fast when running in a straight line and rarely misses a tackle.",
    "Best Value: Rashaad Penny\nExpected Deal Value: $4 million/year\nFrom Week 13 on last season, Penny racked up 706 yards and averaged 6.9 yards per carry.",
    "But it’s been five years since he played more than 900 snaps in a season, so it’s possible that idealized version of Hicks just doesn’t exist anymore.",
    "Buyer Beware: Zach Ertz\nExpected Deal Value: $9 million/year\nErtz’s brief stint in Arizona proved that he’s still a viable threat in the passing game.",
    "Best Value: Marcus Maye\nExpected Deal Value: $8 million/year\nMaye’s 2021 season ended prematurely after he suffered a torn Achilles in early November.",
    "And with injuries becoming a more common occurrence, any team that signs Gilmore should do so with the understanding that he’ll likely miss some time.",
    "Buyer Beware: Tyrann Mathieu\nExpected Deal Value: $17 million/year\nIt pains me to give Mathieu this label, because he remains a very valuable player.",
    "But any team that’s desperate for a change under center can’t overlook what the 2015 first overall pick did in his lone season as the Saints starter.",
    "Whichever team is lucky enough to land him will be getting a disruptive pass rusher who needs just a little schematic help to really make an impact.",
    "Chark\nTeams would be much better off waiting out the first wave of free agency and hoping one of these second-tier names lowers their asking price.",
    "If he can keep that up in an offense that doesn’t provide Sean Payton’s schematic guardrails, he could very well be the missing piece for a team.",
    "And Fitzpatrick, who’s coming off a gnarly hip injury, provides a veteran presence in the locker room and can be a spark off the bench if needed.",
    "It feels like the Rams just won the Super Bowl on their home field, and yet here we are, mere hours away from the start of the NFL free agency.",
    "Smith-Schuster is an ideal slot receiver for teams running the Shanahan-McVay style of offense that continues to spread throughout the league.",
    "But that doesn’t make it any easier to ignore his decline in production—especially in areas of the game that are supposed to be his strengths.",
    "That may drive down the veteran linebacker’s asking price, but he’ll still probably earn an eight-figure salary with whichever team he joins.",
    "Even if 2021 proves to be a blip for Robinson, he’ll need to land with a quarterback who is both willing and able to throw him 50/50 balls.",
    "Bridgewater couldn’t get the most out of a talented Broncos offense, but he was able to put up league-average results in a good situation.",
    "His athleticism is clearly on the decline, which forced Wagner to do more guessing, and that led to uncharacteristic mistakes in coverage.",
    "With Green Bay favoring lighter defensive personnel, the rangy tackler was often left as the only off-the-ball linebacker in the run box.",
    "Buyer Beware: Calais Campbell\nExpected Deal Value: $10 million/year\nCampbell’s playing ability has nothing to do with his placement here.",
    "Top of the Class: J.C. Jackson\nExpected Deal Value: $19 million/year\nJackson might be the best player available in free agency this year.",
    "The legal tampering period gets underway Monday and lasts two days before teams are allowed to start officially signing players at 4 p.m.",
    "So to get you ready for the next few weeks, we’ve put together this handy guide that covers the top players available at every position.",
    "He’s a tough runner, but he isn’t a big play threat—teams can find dozens of backs like that for half the price Fournette will command.",
    "And if he signs for that expected deal value, his contract will look better with each passing year as the salary cap continues to rise.",
    "And we’ve seen other star tackles play well into their late 30s, which should make that eight-figure price tag a bit easier to stomach.",
    "Not in the bad “I’m going to throw the worst interception you’ve ever seen” kind of way that it was during his final season in Tampa.",
    "But the other extreme—with Winston playing as if there was a voice in his head repeating “Don’t fuck up, Jameis” over and over again.",
    "But now that defenses are treating him like a wide receiver, he’s not seeing mismatches against linebackers as often as he once did.",
    "You won’t find a good starter in this group, but any of these guys would be useful in an offense that deploys multiple tight ends.",
    "He increased his accuracy and ability to read the field, his mobility never went away, and he can add a dimension to any run game.",
    "The receiver-needy teams are better off taking big swings in the draft and using free agency to find role players at the position.",
    "Best Value: Marcus Mariota\nExpected Deal Value: $8 million/year\nAs football fans, we deserve one more season of Mariota starting.",
    "And Moses is a good run blocker, but he also willingly signed up to play for the Jets, so decision-making is a big question mark.",
    "The former Raven wasn’t a good fit for Kansas City’s pass-happy attack, which routinely put him on an island in pass protection.",
    "Gilmore still played well when healthy, but he’s no longer a corner you can trust to survive on an island against top receivers.",
    "Both figures led the league, per Pro Football Focus, and that wasn’t a fluke; his tape may be more impressive than the numbers.",
    "But any teams with an inexperienced or inaccurate quarterback ought to look elsewhere to fill vacancies at the position.",
    "The team that signs him will be paying for a career year that wasn’t as good as the traditional counting numbers imply.",
    "But the 27-year-old has only one quality season to his name thus far, and he barely managed to top the 600-yard mark.",
    "There are always some good finds in the secondary cornerback market, and this year’s class is not short on options.",
    "After a nasty quad injury ended his 2020 season, the corner had trouble staying on the field in Carolina last year.",
    "With a deep group of pass rushers headlining the draft class, it doesn’t make much sense to overpay in free agency.",
    "Maye isn’t the most versatile of safeties, but if you park him in the deep part of the field, he will make plays.",
    "If a defense needs a classic center-field type with some man coverage chops, McCourty isn’t a bad veteran option.",
    "Jones, Sheldon Richardson, Maliek Collins\nReferring to this group as the “Secondary Market” isn’t really fair.",
    "This group is made up of pass-catching tight ends who can’t block and run-blocking tight ends who can’t catch.",
    "Uzomah\nExpected Deal Value: $8 million/year\nIn the age of the mismatch tight end, Uzomah will never stand out.",
    "Trubisky would make a fine backup, but it looks like he will fetch low-level starter money on the open market.",
    "If Armstead’s poor injury luck turns, the team that signs him will be set at left tackle for the next decade.",
    "Best Value: Alexander Johnson\nExpected Deal Value: $7 million/year\nJust get him a Patriots uniform already.",
    "That makes him a valuable coverage piece even if you don’t want him playing man-to-man against tight ends.",
    "But it’s hard to imagine those soon-to-be-36-year-old legs supporting that 6-foot-8 frame for much longer.",
    "Maybe he can line up in the box as a run defender or track tight ends and slot receivers in man coverage.",
    "He’s a good player, just not a great one; and he doesn’t have the athleticism to hold up in such a role.",
    "For a receiver who has never created much separation, that would be a concerning trend if it continues.",
    "It is, however, fair to wonder whether his play falls off just a little without Belichick’s coaching.",
    "But he can block and catch the football, and that combination is getting harder to find by the year.",
    "Winston’s 3 percent turnover-worthy play rate was the lowest of his career, per Pro Football Focus.",
    "Before that injury, the former second overall pick was seemingly starting to put things together.",
    "Belichick has no problem saying goodbye to good players, but he rarely does it with cornerbacks.",
    "And when offenses try to exploit that aggressive nature, he’s typically able to adjust quickly.",
    "Fatukasi might wind up being the best player available if his next team can fine-tune his game.",
    "The perennial All-Pro’s 2021 film raised some red flags for a guy now on the wrong side of 30.",
    "But the 29-year-old’s overly physical play style might be starting to take a toll on his body.",
    "This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.",
    "He’s a run stuffer who offers enough pass-rush juice to keep him on the field for third down.",
    "Secondary Market: Gerald Everett, Evan Engram, Maxx Williams, Mo Alie-Cox, Robert Tonyan Jr.",
    "Taking the financial risk would make more sense if Scherff played a more valuable position.",
    "He’s still extremely solid—both as a stout run defender and a penetrating interior rusher.",
    "The Ringer Newsletter\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.",
    "If a team needs a veteran presence for its linebacker, then Hightower is not a bad option.",
    "There are some good players here who will get paid just as much as the guys listed above.",
    "But these guys could all step into a starting lineup and provide some good snaps in 2022.",
    "It’s not a stretch to call Penny the most talented running back available this offseason.",
    "As far as stopgap options go, Mariota isn’t a bad one, and he shouldn’t be too expensive.",
    "MVS also won’t be bringing the league’s reigning MVP along with him to wherever he signs.",
    "Kirk was miscast as an outside receiver in Arizona and would blossom as a full-time slot.",
    "1 receiver he was in New York, but the Rams’ version of Beckham proved to be an elite no.",
    "The 29-year-old hunts for work, aggressively driving on routes in his area of the field.",
    "Reid is more of a box-safety type who was somewhat miscast in Houston’s two-high scheme.",
    "Secondary Market: Casey Hayward, Steven Nelson, Charvarius Ward, Darious Williams, D.J.",
    "But teams will have a hard time finding a solid, veteran guard at a better price point.",
    "Let another team take that risk—even if the immediate rewards seem awfully tantalizing.",
    "If he decides to continue his career, he’ll get plenty of interest on the open market.",
    "Per Sports Info Solutions, Patterson had a negative EPA on runs and overall touches.",
    "And while those touches produced some awesome plays, they weren’t overly efficient.",
    "And Chark is a talented deep threat who got lost in Jacksonville’s woeful offense.",
    "But post-snap antics aside, he’ll help shore up any team’s pass protection unit.",
    "Secondary Market: Folorunso Fatukasi, Sebastian Joseph-Day, Linval Joseph, D.J.",
    "That well-rounded game makes him a low-risk signing who should fit any system.",
    "Any of the guys above could serve as the missing piece for a receiver room.",
    "Dalton doesn’t have much left in the tank, but he can execute a game plan.",
    "Jensen will be worth every dollar, even if his blocking falls off a cliff.",
    "Secondary Market: JuJu Smith-Schuster, Christian Kirk, Will Fuller, D.J.",
    "And he did that while also producing a career-high big-time throw rate.",
    "If Ertz was just an average blocker, he’d be worth a lot more money.",
    "It’s easy and convenient, but you’ll probably end up regretting it.",
    "But the Patriots letting him hit free agency should be concerning.",
    "Fisher is a reliable blindside protector who can’t stay healthy.",
    "A capable quarterback could get Robinson’s career back on track.",
    "He’s also a smart zone defender who isn’t afraid to tackle.",
    "Joseph-Day will improve any run defense you drop him into.",
    "And Richardson can still make an impact on passing downs.",
    "I’m not sure where this newfound interest is coming from.",
    "If so, that projected price tag isn’t too unreasonable.",
    "At 32, Jones still has some good football left in him.",
    "And which teams are in the market for which positions?",
    "Watching Jameis in 2021 was almost comical at times.",
    "This is easily the deepest position in free agency.",
    "The prices shouldn’t be too bad this year, either.",
    "Brown is big and strong, but he can’t really move.",
    "On film, he still looks like a very good player.",
    "Maybe Williams is more than just a deep safety.",
    "If not, teams can find better value elsewhere.",
    "That’s kind of a big deal for a quarterback!",
    "Which free agents will offer the most value?",
    "But there are no starters to be found here.",
    "Jackson will be good wherever he goes.",
    "I don’t know if he’s the bona fide no.",
    "Teams rarely regret paying those guys.",
    "And Diggs can do a little of both.",
    "He’s just a good football player.",
    "Which should teams want to avoid?",
    "That was NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers.",
    "And that’s a bet worth taking.",
    "You can opt out at any time.",
    "Not good ones, anyway.",
    "But, man, can he play.",
    "Let’s get started.",
    "2 receiver money.",
    "Best Value: C.J.",
    "ET on Wednesday.",
    "Best Value: B.J.",
    "2 option.",
    "Reed Jr.",
    "Alas."
