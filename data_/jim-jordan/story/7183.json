    "pic.twitter.com/5X1UdWC5Xb\n\nCNN In Meltdown Mode Over Biden-Ukraine Phone Call Fiasco\n\nBy Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, Jan 28, 2022:\n\nUpdate (2023ET): CNN journos doing damage control after the network’s Natasha Bertrand panicked and deleted tweets containing harsh comments reportedly made by President Biden to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky – namely that a Russian invasion was “imminent,” that the Capital city of Kyiv could be “sacked,” and to “prepare for impact.”\n\nNow – none of that apparently happened according to CNN‘s Jim Sciutto, the White House, and apparently Ukraine itself.",
    "Here’s more from CNN:\n\nZelensky has been particularly concerned about the US’ rhetoric that war could be “imminent” — a word White House press secretary Jen Psaki used earlier this week to describe the US’ assessment of Russia’s plans — and the recent disclosures of intelligence to US media, the source said, which “is causing panic and economic disaster for Ukraine.” Zelensky is expected to convey to Biden that he believes the US and its allies have to be more careful with their messaging surrounding the conflict, the source added.",
    "(@JackPosobiec) January 28, 2022\n\nCNN‘s Alexander Marquardt gives a master class in walking back misinformation:\n\n* * *\n\nIn their Thursday afternoon phone call which the White House called “a check-in”, it seems President Joe Biden took the opportunity to continue with an alarmist posture as he told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy that a Russian invasion is “now highly certain” – according to CNN.",
    "But it remains that two conflicting narratives have emerged, given just prior to the call it was being reported that Zelensky was expected to request that the US be more cautious in its messaging surrounding a potential Russian attack, per source–particularly the word “imminent,” as it risks causing panic and negative economic consequences for Ukraine.",
    "Of note, CNN claims their source was a “senior Ukrainian official.”\n\nHuman Events‘ Jack Posobiec lays it out:\n\nWe may have just caught a CNN reporter deleting a war report that exposed the truth about the White House and Ukraine And it now looks like the White House pressured them to pull it The American people deserve the truth — Jack Posobiec ????",
    "Again, compare the low key statement of Ukraine’s president himself with what Biden reportedly said to him concerning the “level” of the threat, supposedly with Kiev itself in the crosshairs…\n\nA Russian invasion is now virtually certain once the ground freezes, Biden said to Zelensky, a senior Ukrainian official told @mchancecnn.",
    "(@JackPosobiec) January 28, 2022\n\nAnd the White House disputes:\n\nWe also see a tweet from Emily Horne, a Biden official, which is a brief denial, but does not include the the specific details of Sciuttio’s tweet That means the White House was working the phones to CNN https://t.co/6z8BEW3SBI — Jack Posobiec ????",
    "But the statement immediately after the call of Zelensky himself was much more toned down compared to the White House rhetoric…\n\n“Discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation and agreed on joint actions for the future,” Zelenskiy said in a tweet.",
    "— Alexander Marquardt (@MarquardtA) January 27, 2022\n\nThe Ukrainian side appears to have leaked that Biden informed Zelensky that it’s “virtually certain” that Ukraine’s capital could be “sacked” and that Russian forces are looking to occupy it.",
    "Zelensky’s spokesperson about the call with Joe Biden: “Some reports regarding the content of the talks between Presidents Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden have appeared on social media, citing the alleged ‘senior Ukrainian official’.",
    "According to leakers close to the story, and reported by CNN, the call, which lasted an hour and 20 minutes, and described as “candid” by the two leaders, saw Biden and Zelensky butting heads on the threat posed by Russia.",
    "Indeed this has been the messaging of the Ukrainians all week, especially after the US took the dramatic step of telling some of its embassy staff in Kiev to leave the country over the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine.",
    "(@JackPosobiec) January 28, 2022\n\nWe may have just caught a CNN reporter deleting a war report that exposed the truth about the White House and Ukraine\n\nAnd it now looks like the White House pressured them to pull it.",
    "Zelensky during the call reportedly told the US president to calm down…\n\nApparently, Biden was unaware of the talks going on this week in Paris between Germany, France, Russia, and Ukraine — Jack Posobiec ????",
    "Further, “President Biden reaffirmed the readiness of the United States along with its allies and partners to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,” according to the White House call readout.",
    "pic.twitter.com/Z3blRfCjw2 — Ostap Yarysh (@OstapYarysh) January 28, 2022\n\nCNN is now accusing CNN of spreading war propaganda on CNN This is where we’re at on the Ukraine call leak — Jack Posobiec ????",
    "“Thanked President Joe Biden for the ongoing military assistance,” he said, also affirming that the US offered further financial support to Ukraine, which was highlighted in the Biden statement.",
    "(@JackPosobiec) January 27, 2022\n\nIt seems the two leaders were openly at odds over the true level of the threat, with the White House now being accused of grossly inflating the threat.",
    "Biden “made clear that despite the departure of American family members of embassy personnel, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, remains open and fully operational,” according to the US readout.",
    "Bertrand apparently didn’t get the message to CNN‘s Jake Tapper and Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance, who repeated the now-disputed report – which CNN just deleted.",
    "Well, there is precedent… https://t.co/SsX6W2LLFK\n\nWell @davidfrum , @Liz_Cheney & @MaxBoot , when are you preparing to buy your plane tickets to go defend Ukraine?",
    "(@ZelenskyyUa) January 27, 2022\n\nCNN and mainstream media in general have of late seemed intent on hyping and stoking tensions to the point of armed conflict.",

    "BREAKING: We have recovered the Ukraine call report that @JakeTapper and CNN just deleted Please DO NOT RT this as they do not want anyone to see it!",
    "Kyiv could be “sacked,” Russian forces may attempt to occupy it, “prepare for impact”, Biden said, according to this official.",
    "(@JackPosobiec) January 28, 2022\n\nNow, Posobiec reports that Zelensky’s office is also denying CNN’s report.",
    "Discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation and agreed on joint actions for the future.",
