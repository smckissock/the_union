    "As the most reliable and balanced news aggregation service on the internet, DML News App offers the following information published by Breitbart:\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) is demanding answers from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) regarding its “collusion” with the Biden administration to use federal law enforcement to investigate parents attending school board meetings as “domestic terrorists.”\nIn a letter obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, Jordan — who is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee — points out that the NSBA’s original letter to President Joe Biden prompted a “rapid and stunning response … that culminated in a directive from the Attorney General for federal law enforcement to monitor school board matters.”\nThe article goes on to state the following:\nJordan also pointed out in the letter that the NSBA and Biden administration sought to manufacture a reason for federal law enforcement to go after parents, saying, “We still have concerns about the NSBA’s collusion with the Biden Administration to develop a pretext for invoking federal law enforcement to intimidate and silence parents.” [Emphasis added].",
    "Despite new CEO John Heim’s effort to rehabilitate the NSBA’s image and ‘restore trust’ in the association, you have still failed to produce a single document response to our requests.”\nThe House Judiciary GOP provided a copy of the entire letter on Twitter Wednesday:\n#BREAKING: @Jim_Jordan blasts NSBA for failing to produce documents in relation to school boards investigation pic.twitter.com/htvWFkzzsy\n— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) March 9, 2022\n“Moms and dads deserve answers.",
    "Jordan’s letter to the National School Boards Association begins:\n“It has been over four months since we first requested documents and information about the National School Boards Association’s (NSBA) letter to President Biden in which the NSBA equated parents with domestic terrorists and urged federal intervention – including use of the Patriot Act – to silence parents at school board meetings.",
