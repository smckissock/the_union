    "“And rather than treat Jan. 6 as a protest that got way out of hand with some criminal elements, no doubt the Biden administration and their media cronies insisted on claiming that it was an insurrection and treating everyone who supported President Trump as a traitor.”\n“Here’s how the Biden team looks at the world: They believe that most people who support the GOP are dangerous, they’re dangerous elements that need to be policed and watched.”\nShe played clips of Biden calling the riot an “insurrection” on par with the Civil War, noting that Biden continues to preach that Americans who own firearms he dubs “assault weapons” may be sought.",

    "They abused their power in the way they handled the Jan. 6 situation, and they trash our country’s history every chance they get.”\n“After 13 months of President Biden, Americans have every reason to be suspicious of anything they do that involves collecting information about Americans.",

    "“Republicans in Congress, especially when they take back power, need to exercise strict oversight over every aspect of this Biden team.",
    "You don’t think they’d try to stop gun ownership protected by the Second Amendment over an epidemic of violence,” she said.",
    "I’m talking about lists, databases or surveillance of anything, including your health records or social media history.",
    "And they need to prohibit and defund every action and every policy that undermines our basic constitutional rights.",
    "“[Attorney General Merrick Garland’s] words at the time were meant to intimidate and scare parents.",
