    "The Republican answered their perfectly legitimate ask with a four-page letter detailing his quibbles with the committee, including a declaration that the request “violates core Constitutional principles.”\nWhen did congressional hearings become unconstitutional?",
    "“January 6 was not an insurrection… [but] there may very well have been a ‘fedsurrection.’”\nThe conspiracy theory is that Ray Epps, a man seen in footage from that day, was secretly an FBI informant who tricked Trump supporters into ransacking the Capitol.",
    "There’s Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who tweeted an anti-Semitic trope claiming “upscale liberals who control the media” believe that Jan. 6 is another 9/11, despite the fact that on the day of the Capitol riot, he also condemned the attackers.",

    "Greene, who was stripped of her committee assignments last year and kicked off Twitter earlier this month for her lies about COVID-19, has been living in an alternate reality for years.",
    "Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the speech “unpresidential” and said Biden’s push to end the filibuster was “incoherent, incorrect and beneath his office.”\nIncoherent and incorrect?",
    "When members of the House Select Committee on Jan. 6 asked Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to meet with them, they probably should’ve known that he wouldn’t comply with their request.",
    "This week, President Joe Biden gave a speech on the filibuster and voting rights that compared Republicans trying to curtail voting rights to the segregationists of the 1960s.",
    "Seeing as the GOP spent the year following the Jan. 6 attack planning how to be successful in the next presidential election, the comparison almost seems too tame.",
    "He’d been in the middle of begging for forgiveness for accidentally telling the truth about Jan. 6, and this was the perfect way to humiliate himself even further.",
    "The pair of right-wing conservatives, like the rest of the GOP, skipped the official proceedings to commemorate the Jan. 6 insurrection and held their own event.",
    "Not only was the Trump administration still in charge of the federal government at the time, but what purpose would framing Trump supporters even serve?",

    "And yet…\nIf the truth is whatever Cruz or Greene feel like on any given day, it becomes asymmetrical warfare to operate with a set of fixed rules.",
    "Why should the party that doesn’t believe in anything beyond owning the libs and serving its donors set the parameters for politics and society?",
    "Instead, we have a GOP that never hesitates to lie, engages in wild conspiracy theories, and makes even the biggest hypocrites look like saints.",
    "“Why do we assume that the body’s natural immune system isn’t the marvel that it is?” he asked on a conservative radio show earlier this month.",
    "The GOP is the party that was willing to default on the debt ceiling and usher in unprecedented economic turmoil to stick it to the liberals.",
    "The Biden administration’s poll numbers are lagging, and there are already rumblings of a tough midterm election for the Democratic Party.",
    "However, the current problem is best encapsulated not by the GOP response to Biden’s voting rights speech, but by the Democratic one.",
    "The GOP has proven time and time again that it will make up bald-faced lies about anything, from an attempted coup to a deadly virus.",
    "Advertisement\nWell, a president also can’t inspire thousands of his supporters to overrun the U.S. Capitol to overturn an election.",
    "Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) speak on the one-year anniversary of the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",

    "Part of the reason why is that the Democratic base is feeling abandoned by the people it elected.",
    "We can’t forget Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who touted the perfect solution to the pandemic: God.",
    "On Thursday, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said that Biden went “a little too far” in his rhetoric.",
