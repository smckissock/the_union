    "First, in May, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell decided to come out forcefully against an independent commission to study the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol, despite the fact that its creation had been part of a bipartisan deal in the House -- and 35 House Republicans had voted for it.",

Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana on the panel.",

    "That bet looks like a loser as of today, with the committee seemingly poised to deliver a far more definitive -- and impactful -- review of that fateful day than many expected.",
    "The idea being that without Republican participation the whole thing would look like a partisan witch hunt, with little practical damage, politically speaking, to the GOP.",
    "\"Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts,\" McCarthy said at the time.",
    "Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who refused a subpoena by the committee, was charged with criminal contempt by the Justice Department.",

    "This won't be about what some Democratic members say happened on January 6 and what role (if any) Trump played in it.",
    "In a December TV interview, McConnell said the committee is seeking to uncover \"something the public needs to know.\"",
