    "The original lawsuit was filed under the common law right of access, according to WND, because “the Capitol Police refused to provide records of the day, and Congress had exempted itself from the Freedom of Information Act requirements imposed on others.”\nThe case sought emails that were sent among Capitol Police officials, the FBI, the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security in regards to Jan. 6., along with the video footage from the Capitol.",
    "pic.twitter.com/6zVW0lE0Ni\n— Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) January 3, 2022\nLetter from Bennie Thompson to Mark Meadows’ attorney concludes:\n“The Select Committee is left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution” pic.twitter.com/ahiwtgTaub\n— Alayna Treene (@alaynatreene) December 8, 2021\nIt’s time for Pelosi to admit the jig is up already.",
    "This has resulted in Judicial Watch filing an opposition to a claim from the US Capitol Police department in which it argues that the videos along with related emails and other documents “are not public records.”\nThey make the astounding claim that there is no public interest in the videos being released and that “sovereign immunity” prevents Americans from suing to gain access to them in order to see what happened at our Capitol.",
    "“The hypocrisy is rich, as this is the same Congress which is trying to jail witnesses who, citing privileges, object to providing documents to the Pelosi January 6 committee.”\nThanks to Judicial Watch, multiple audio, visual and photo records have already been revealed regarding the shooting death of unarmed military veteran Ashli Babbitt who was in the Capitol.",
    "— RepScottPerry (@RepScottPerry) December 21, 2021\n(2//2) I decline this entity’s request and will continue to fight the failures of the radical Left who desperately seek distraction from their abject failures of crushing inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, and the horrendous crisis they created at our border.",
    "“The Supreme Court was unequivocal in stating that there is a federal common law right of access ‘to inspect and copy public records and documents.’ … [T]he general rule is that all three branches of government, legislative, executive, and judicial, are subject to the common law right,” Judicial Watch reported.",
    "“The Pelosi Congress (and its police department) is telling a federal court it is immune from all transparency under law and is trying to hide every second of its January 6 videos and countless emails,” said Judicial Watch chief Tom Fitton.",
    "(1/2) I stand with immense respect for our Constitution, the Rule of Law, and the Americans I represent who know that this entity is illegitimate, and not duly constituted under the rules of the US House of Representatives.",
    "(TeaParty.org Exclusive) – It was only a matter of time before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to address the calls for her to be transparent about what took place on and during the events of Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "Because of the Freedom of Information exemption that Congress gave itself, Judicial Watch asked for access under the common law that grants the public a right to access public records and documents.",
    "In October, Judicial Watch released records, showing that multiple officers claimed they didn’t see a weapon in Babbitt’s hand before Byrd shot her, and that Byrd was visibly distraught afterward.",
    "As we could have predicted, Pelosi is engaging in “rich hypocrisy” as she continues to hide video footage that shows the entirety of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.",
    "She’s also claiming to have sovereign immunity, meaning she is not required to let the public in on the facts of what really happened on that day.",
    "One officer attested that he didn’t hear any verbal commands before Byrd shot Babbitt.”\nNew letter from @RodneyDavis and @HouseAdmnGOP.",
    "“The records include a cell phone video of the shooting and an audio of a brief police interview of the shooter, Lt. Michael Byrd.",
    "Judicial Watch, a government-watchdog organization, has been attempting to gain access to the video being hidden by Pelosi.",
    "Release the video footage so Americans can see what a sham the Jan. 6 incident really was.",
    "The video footage comes from hundreds of monitor cameras posted throughout the Capitol.",
    "Pelosi has refused to grant this request despite the footage being public record.",
