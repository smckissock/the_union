    "Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of Russiagate fame recently said that if the Republican Party was going to have any future, it could not be former President Donald Trump’s “anti-truth cult.”\nSchiff made his comments on Tuesday during an interview, ironically, on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.”\nAdam Schiff: GOP Can’t Be the ‘Anti-Truth Cult’ Around Trump if They Want Any Future https://t.co/yohkgDDESk pic.twitter.com/6lqygvUNZh\n— Gaby (@gabymixH) January 12, 2022\nRELATED: Report: McCarthy Will Oust Omar, Schiff, And Swalwell From Committee Assignments If GOP Wins The House\nRep. Schiff Predicts The GOP’s Future\nMitchell said, “We’re hearing something very different from another Republican, Republican Senator Mike Rounds, saying that his party should tell the truth about the 2020 election after he was attacked by former President Trump in recent days.",

Jim Jordan Refuses To Cooperate With Democrats’ Jan. 6 Committee, Calls Request ‘Unprecedented And Inappropriate’\n“If the Republican Party is going to have any future it has to get back to being a party of ideas and ideology and not this anti-truth cult of the former president,” Schiff said.",
    "“So I think he’s spot-on, and I think it will also not only be important for the Republican Party, it’s important for the country that both parties be whetted to the truth and stop tearing down, in the case of the Republican Party, public confidence in our elections because that leads to political violence as we saw on January 6,” Schiff added.",
    "And so, in my opinion, if we want to keep the confidence of our supporters and our voters, then we have to be honest with them.”\nSchiff followed up, saying, “Well, he’s absolutely right.",
    "The truth matters, integrity matters.”\nHe didn’t address his Russiagate comments from the last five years and how that fits into truth and integrity.",
    "Take a listen to Senator Rounds’ comments.”\nRounds said, “I think as Republicans we owe it to tell the truth.",
    "Then Schiff addressed what he believes might be in store for a Republican Party still focused on Trump.",
    "He has not made one honest statement on the House floor in over 5 years.",
    "Who is Schiff to accuse anyone of disinformation?",
    "And I think integrity matters."
