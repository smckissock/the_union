    "(Source Fox News)\nFox News’ Jeanine Pirro blamed Hillary Clinton on Monday for dividing the country and dividing families with “four years of hell” over her narrative on Russian collusion.",
    "“This is surveillance of servers to a Russian bank connected to Putin to make it look the president of the United States is a Putin puppet and a Russian asset,” Pirro said of the filing.",
    "Who do you think was behind all of this?”\n“Well obviously,” Pirro answered without hesitation, “it’s the Clinton campaign and Hillary Clinton.",
    "— Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) February 12, 2022\nThey spied on Trump during the campaign, and they spied on him as President.",
