    "That's how you win.”\nJordan’s answer was in response to host Grant Stinchfield, who asked if he should be concerned that people are taking the idea of a red wave for granted and that conservatives may be too confident in their prospects for the November midterm elections, especially since Democrats have seemingly been doing better in terms of Congressional redistricting than Republicans.",
    "Appearing on Newsmax’s “Stinchfield,” Jordan said that “you always want to be confident, but never overconfident.” Regarding the November midterm elections, this means “you fight, and you take your message to the American people.",
    "Jordan added that there are reasons to be confident, pointing to Republican Glenn Youngkin’s gubernatorial win in Virginia, Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal in Kenosha, and the truckers in Canada protesting COVID-19 mandates.",
