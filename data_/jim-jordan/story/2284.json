    "… Take the example of Twitter, if they’re not originating this content, if you’re posting something else that happened or an article or a statement, you’re not originating that content, and tech companies were arguing, “Well, we can’t be held liable for this content.”\nSo there was a grand compromise and the goal was to create the incentives for these companies to moderate the illegal, the illicit material, in exchange for immunity protections from lawsuits.",
    "And as lawmakers move forward, as they look for solutions, that’s obviously so critical, but there’s an immediate need for individuals in their own homes to kind of be judging, “OK, how do we set boundaries on things like time on Instagram and Snapchat and all these things?” What would be your words of wisdom, as you’re talking with parents in your state and even across the country who are seeing the negative implications of social media on their kids?",
    "Unfortunately, when it comes to censorship, when it comes to protecting free speech, we’ve had hearings in the House, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Democrats’ proposals are really focused on more government, more government regulation, and advocating that we need to address misinformation and disinformation, but that’s just another way for them to control what actually would be on these platforms.",
    "And I’m working with [Rep.] Jim Jordan from the Judiciary Committee on draft legislation that would remove those Section 230 provisions for the larger companies and hold them accountable for a new set of rules, while protecting those liability protections for the smaller startups, the new innovators, the Parlers, the Gettr, the Truth media of the future.",
    "It is extremely difficult for parents to control what’s happening on these devices, and that’s why we need to take action, we need to equip parents, we need to protect our kids, we need to ensure our constitutional rights, freedom of speech, the battle of ideas continues in this country.",
    "Allen: Well, you head the task force on Big Tech Censorship and Data for the House Republicans, and this is an issue that is really of concern to all of us because daily we are seeing more and more issues of these Big Tech platforms censoring conservatives in particular.",
    "“These tech companies have become very destructive in so many different ways, and it is time for Congress to act on behalf of the American people, on behalf of parents, and on behalf of our children and the young generation,” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., says.",
    "Most have concluded since then that that actually would’ve only further entrenched the big guys and that the very 230 immunity protections that would’ve been vetoed are what are being used right now by Truth, his media company, in order to grow and to be competitive.",
    "So there’s a big debate between government regulating and controlling in the name of misinformation, disinformation, versus those of us who believe in the battle of ideas, free speech, and that the answer to information that is false is actually more information.",
    "I mean, that’s pretty fundamental to who we are and we need a privacy law that will ensure that we know what’s being collected, how it’s being shared, and how it’s being used and if it’s being sold, and empower the individual to protect that private information.",
    "McMorris Rodgers: The goal is to agree on a package of bills that will hold Big Tech accountable, that will ensure that we are protecting free speech and the battle of ideas because that is so fundamental and, as conservatives, we are seeking a lot of input.",
    "My goal is to be ready on Day One, on Day One of January 2023, that we would be able to hammer out what we believe are going to be very, very strong and effective reforms that will hold Big Tech accountable while also protecting the free markets.",
    "Rodgers, who leads House Republicans’ task force on Big Tech Censorship and Data, joins “The Daily Signal Podcast” to answer these questions and explain what Congress is doing to protect Americans’ free speech rights on social media platforms.",
    "We also cover these stories:\nFollowing face-to-face talks with Ukrainian counterparts in Istanbul, Turkey, officials on Tuesday, Russian officials announce a reduction in military operations near the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv.",
    "I think that’s a really helpful explanation to kind of hear some of the background of Section 230 and then what you-all, among the House Republicans, are trying to do to really protect Americans and to ensure those free speech rights.",
    "So when we dive in and when we talk about these various instances of tech censorship, what are some of the other policies that you and your colleagues are promoting and are discussing in order to stop so much censorship happening?",
    "And these tech companies have become very destructive in so many different ways and it is time for Congress to act on behalf of the American people, on behalf of parents, and on behalf of our children and the young generation.",
    "There’s examples where illegal activity, sex trafficking, or the individual who bought a pill thinking that it was Oxycontin when it was laced with fentanyl off of Twitter, and yet Twitter can’t be held liable, right?",
    "There’s the example of COVID-19 origins when, at the beginning of COVID-19 for months, actually, well over a year, any mention of the potential of COVID being originated at a Wuhan lab in China was blocked.",
    "There was a time when President [Donald] Trump called for the outright repeal of Section 230 and he actually vetoed the [National Defense Authorization Act], saying that we need to repeal Section 230.",
    "Probably one that is still being played out today is the example of Hunter Biden and his emails on his laptop and the New York Post story that, just days before the election in 2020, was censored.",
    "Because of course, as conservatives, we champion free markets and we want companies to be able to make their way and forge ahead, but we also champion free speech and protection of those rights.",
    "I have examples in my own household, among my kids, that it’s frightening to me how quickly they can get down a path on the internet or on some of these sites that is very destructive.",
    "We are welcoming that input so that we’re ready on Day One with conservative reforms because we’re going to have to be united if we have any chance of being successful.",
    "I also believe that the issue around the harm of these platforms, Facebook and Twitter, and these platforms, social media on our young people needs to be addressed.",
    "… What we’ve really seen in the past few years is that even among conservatives, there’s quite a bit of debate about what do we do with these Big Tech companies?",
    "Listen to the podcast below or read the lightly edited transcript:\nVirginia Allen: I am so pleased today to be joined by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.",
    "I think some who have been promoting that are now recognizing that that might actually entrench them also, that we would put them into the law as a monopoly.",
    "The Food and Drug Administration gives emergency authorization to a second booster shot for the COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna.",
    "As Americans, one of our constitutional values, fundamental values, fundamental rights, is the right to free speech and it includes political speech.",
    "Is there bipartisan support between Republicans and Democrats to recognize, “OK, there are changes that need to take place, reforms are needed”?",
    "The way that it has been interpreted in the years after 1996 has really given them, unfortunately, the courts have given them blanket immunity.",
    "So they’re absolutely deciding what’s going to be shared and promoted through their algorithms and that’s different than just hosting the site.",
    "But there’s also examples where individuals, members of Congress, conservatives have been blocked or taken down by these platforms, certainly.",
    "It is to get it out there so you can have the battle of ideas and so that you can expose when something that is being said is actually false.",
    "So if you are subject to your individual or your site being taken down, you would be able to appeal that decision in a short amount of time.",
    "There’s another one that is debated around common carrier and whether or not these Big Tech companies should be treated as common carriers.",
    "To sound off, please email letters@DailySignal.com and we’ll consider publishing your edited remarks in our regular “We Hear You” feature.",
    "Allen: Well, before we let you go, I do want to ask you personally, you’re a mom, and I think so many parents struggle with social media.",
    "We need to incentivize more content to be left up, that the battle of ideas that we’ve long cherished as Americans need to be protected.",
    "Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us once again here on “The Daily Signal Podcast.”\nRep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers: Thanks.",
    "Also, requiring transparency of the platforms as to why they’re making those decisions, and that would all have to be made public.",
    "And now it is playing out even today where we are learning more about these emails and that they are, in fact, legitimate, right?",
    "Cyberbullying—I’ve talked to parents whose kids were the victims of cyberbullying and parents felt like they had no place to go.",
    "Others, it is the anxiety, the stress, the mental health that has been driven by these companies, but also the illegal activity.",
    "It was put into place in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, long before Google, Facebook, Twitter were even dreamed of, right?",
    "… Also, it’s not just illegal, illicit material, but now we see where, through algorithms, they are promoting certain content.",
    "So we’re proposing to ensure more transparency, ideas to equip parents to protect their kids from the uses of these platforms.",
    "Is there agreement among House Republicans about how to solve these issues and how to move forward on things like Section 230?",
    "At the time, there was a big debate over pornography or criminal activity, that companies would be protected from liability.",

    "And that’s fundamental to these reforms, that the smaller companies and the new competitors are able to be competitive.",
    "I have three school-aged kids and the screens are a continual battle and so much of our lives take us to the screens.",
    "And the goal was to incentivize these platforms, companies, to moderate content—so illegal content, illicit content.",
    "So the work that we’re doing over these few months is critical to that overall success and having a set of reforms.",
    "And there’s a big difference between taking down illegal content and then censoring political speech, free speech.",

    "So those are some of the questions that we’re having to debate right now.",
