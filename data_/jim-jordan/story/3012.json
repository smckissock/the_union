    "Science”, Paul recently released an amendment to get rid of Fauci – or his position at least – Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease,\nPaul, citing Fauci as a “dictator-in-chief” says the amendment is necessary because “no one person should have unilateral authority to make decisions for millions of Americans.”\nPaul continued to go after Fauci by saying, “I’ve been a physician for over 33 years.",
    "In all my years studying and practicing medicine, I had never encountered someone with the gall to proclaim himself ‘the science’ and portray anyone opposing him as ‘attacking science.’ That is until Dr. Fauci became the COVID dictator-in-chief.”\nThe amendment also has a common sense approach to medicine, separating the NIH department into three branches – allergic diseases, infectious diseases and immunological diseases.",
    "In leaked Wikileaks emails, he professed his love for Hillary Clinton during the hearings and emailed her staff “Anyone who had any doubts about the Secretary’s stamina and capability following her illness had those doubts washed away by today’s performance before the Senate and the House.",
    "Kentucky Senator Rand Paul has had many contentious hearings with Fauci, trying to get him to tell the truth about COVID-19, especially about NIH funding of the Wuhan lab.",
    "He said, “It’s Benghazi hearings all over again.”\nIf he means, trying to get facts on record and some accountability for the death of Americans, then yes.",
    "Fauci is probably responding to House republicans like Texas REP Chip Roy or Ohio REP Jim Jordan who have made comments that they’ll be coming after him.",
    "Even though he’s lied to us about masks and vaccines and lockdowns and COVID-19 therapies and many other things, he should still be adored and revered.",
    "Not wanting the republicans to question his integrity and competency, Fauci whined more about any upcoming hearings he’d be subjected to.",
    "The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette.",
    "And then there’s all of the animal experiments that his department has funded that the public is up in arms about.",
    "He said the hearings “will distract me from doing my job, the way it’s doing right now.”\nOh, is that the problem?",
    "He’s also worried about republicans taking control of Congress and having to appear in “Benghazi-like” hearings.",
    "And he loves and is proud of Clinton for not taking any responsibility for the deaths of Americans in Benghazi?",
    "We don’t need an 81-year-old deep state narcissist making decisions about our health and our lives anymore.",
    "She faced extremely difficult circumstances at the hearings and still she hit it right out of the park.",
    "Fauci has been a dismal failure in his career as Director of NIH since 1984 – from AIDS to COVID-19.",
    "Please tell her that we all love her and are very proud to know her.”\nHe’s got one thing right.",
    "Poor Anthony Fauci is just not getting the love and praise he thinks that he deserves.",
    "They just refuse to leave their powerful jobs once they are installed in government.",
    "It originally appeared in SteveGruber.com and is used by permission.",
    "It’s really time for 81-year-old white man Fauci to hit the road.",
    "If he hasn’t done anything wrong, he has nothing to worry about.",
    "But Fauci refuses to admit anything or acknowledge any truths.",
    "Least of all, one who gets proven wrong over and over again.",
    "I wouldn’t say he’s a very well-liked appointed bureaucrat.",
    "They find Fauci not only tyrannical, but also incompetent.",
    "It makes total sense so it’ll probably never come to pass.",
    "This piece was written by Liberty Paige on March 18, 2022.",
    "Like I said earlier, I have the perfect answer for him.",
    "But this is not all poor Fauci has to worry about.",
    "But he’s a loyalist to the democrat party.",
    "Fauci knows all about Benghazi hearings.",
    "What is it with old white democrats?",
    "It certainly was a performance.",
    "Yet others don’t agree.",
    "But instead he whines.",
    "He’s been distracted?",
    "Disgusted with “Mr.",
    "Or so he thinks.",
    "That’s sick.",
    "Retire.",
    "Retire."
