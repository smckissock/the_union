    "Source: AP Photo/John Raoux\nGOP Rep. Jim Jordan (OH) said Friday that House Republicans should weigh the possibility of impeaching President Joe Biden over the president's poor job performance, particularly his administration's inability to curb the surge of illegal immigration at the southern border.",
    "His decision to just defy federal immigration laws and allow 2 million people to come here unimpeded in direct contravention of his obligation under Article 2 of the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" he said at the time.",
    "\"We cannot have a president of the United States that is willing to abuse the power of the office of the presidency and be easily bought off by foreign governments, Chinese energy companies, Ukrainian energy companies.",
    "Cruz said there were \"multiple grounds to consider for impeachment\" against Biden, but, much like Jordan, cited the president's failure at the southern border as the primary reason to remove him from office.",
    "In January, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he expects Republicans to consider impeaching Biden \"whether it's justified or not\" if the party retakes Congress following the 2022 elections.",
    "And one of the real disadvantages of doing that … is the more you weaponize it and turn it into a partisan cudgel, you know, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.\"",
    "\"I would like to announce on behalf of the American people, we have to make sure that our leaders are held accountable,\" Greene said during a Jan. 13, 2021, Newsmax interview.",
    "\"Democrats weaponized impeachment,” he said on his podcast \"Verdict with Ted Cruz,\" referring to House Democrats impeaching former President Donald Trump twice.",
    "And last January, before Biden even took office, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced plans to introduce a resolution to impeach Biden.",
    "\"I think that’s definitely a discussion we have to have,\" Jordan told The Washington Times at a Republican planning retreat in Florida.",
    "Border Patrol agents encountered 164,973 migrants in February, a 7 percent increase over January encounters.",
    "\"Probably the most compelling is the utter lawlessness of President Biden's refusal to enforce the border.",
    "\"You have to have complete buy-in from the entire conference and the leadership of our conference.\"",
    "He explained that every House Republican would need to support impeaching the commander-in-chief.",
    "Jordan is just the latest Republican to suggest an impeachment of the 79-year-old president.",
    "\"They used it for partisan purposes to go after Trump because they disagreed with him.",
    "Greene formally introduced a resolution to impeach the president on Jan. 21, 2021.",
    "So on January 21, I will be filing articles of impeachment on Joe Biden.\"",
    "\"The conference has to decide,\" Jordan said."
