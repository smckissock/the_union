    "“Just like journalists,” the agency said, “we do research with public information.”\nRep. Kelly Armstrong told Politico on Jan. 24 it was a “very, very bad practice” and that it sounded “dangerously close—if not already over the line—to spying on members of Congress, their staff, their constituents, and their supporters.”\nArmstrong then went on to demand that anyone involved in the public record surveillance practices be fired immediately.",
    "Nehls has been an adamant defender of Trump’s and just this week told Newsweek that Jan. 6 was a “law enforcement failure” and a “complete failure of security.”\nHe has also blasted the Jan. 6 committee as a witch hunt hellbent on trying to make Republicans ‘look like we’re absolutely crazy” instead of figuring out why cops were not ready for the assault.",
    "It took more than three months for the Senate to complete; Capitol Police responded on a relatively even-keel, saying it agreed improvements must be made to beef up intelligence-sharing between agencies—but it insisted that there was no way the USCP or others could have anticipated what they ultimately endured on Jan. 6.",
    "Nehls also claimed he was being targeted by police because of his outspokenness and opposition to the official Jan. 6 probe, his support of former President Donald Trump, and his defense of Ashli Babbitt, the U.S. Air Force veteran who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6 and was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer.",

    "Top intelligence agencies did not give adequate warning to law enforcement before the Capitol assault, the report found, and another memo from the FBI dated Jan. 5, 2021 warning people of a brewing “war” in Washington was never delivered to the senior officials in charge at USCP.",
    "Causing much consternation among Republicans on the shadow committee as well was Farnham’s directive ordering analysts to “search for information about lawmakers’ opponents and their opponents’ supporters… to see if they or their followers intend to attend or disrupt” an event.",
    "Then, in an interview this past Sunday with Axios, Rep. Jim Banks didn’t parse words either, explaining that the shadow group would produce a report by this fall—just in time for midterms—that would lay responsibility squarely on the police for preparedness issues on Jan. 6.",
    "He said at the time: “I would never accuse the rank and file, they need an apology.”\nA 127-page bipartisan report issued last year by the U.S. Senate about security and intelligence failures surrounding Jan. deemed both federal agencies as well as Capitol Police to blame.",
    "At the time, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee said the failure to adequately assess the threat of violence looming over Washington that day “contributed significantly” to the Capitol breach.",

    "Information that USCP had among its intelligence division had been collecting since at least mid-December and online chatter about the impending “wild” rally in Washington was pervasive.",
    "The pressure on USCP from the shadow committee only kept ratcheting up when on Tuesday member Troy Nehls took to Twitter to accuse the agency, point blank, of illegally spying on him.",
    "As Newsweek noted in an interview Thursday with Nehls, when the former Texas sheriff first came to Congress, he was on the job just three days when the insurrection occurred.",
    "Where once Capitol Police only compiled reports that assessed lawmaker logistics for congressional events and meetings on and off-campus, Farnam implemented new criteria.",
    "Per protocol, a uniformed officer went inside, assessed any possible threats or theft, and took pictures of the room to later share with the lawmaker’s office.",
    "The USCP officer, Manger revealed, became especially concerned after entering Nehls’ office only to see the word “body armor” scrawled on a large whiteboard.",
    "Leadership for U.S. Capitol Police has defended the new practice, saying it was on par with normal protocols to protect members of congress.",
    "A large X that the same USCP officer also saw on a map of the Rayburn building in Nehls’ office was innocuous, too, according to Nehls.",
