    "Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) raged on Twitter: “Now that the New York Times has even confirmed the Hunter Biden laptop’s veracity, can we begin to admit that Joe Biden is, by definition, a compromised politician?”\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) tweeted a link to a Post story on the Times’ confirmation, saying simply: “Told ya.”\nAnd the House Judiciary GOP linked the laptop scandal to claims by Democrats that former President Donald Trump colluded with Russia ahead of the 2016 presidential election.",
    "“Even today, Hunter Biden is getting paid millions for his ‘artwork’ in a corrupt arrangement blessed by the White House.”\nThe GOP backlash was in response to a Gray Lady report earlier this week that belatedly verified a trove of emails contained on the laptop’s hard drive — 17 months after The Post first started reporting on it.",

    "Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) fumed that the “cover up” helped President Biden secure victory in the 2020 election.",
    "“For decades, the Biden family has cashed in on Joe’s government service,” Cotton added in a subsequent tweet.",
    "“The New York Times admits what we’ve known for years: the Hunter Biden laptop story was true.",
    "Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) called for a congressional probe in the wake of the Times report.",
    "Big tech’s censorship of this story was a disgrace,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)",
