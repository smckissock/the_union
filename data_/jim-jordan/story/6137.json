Garland to use the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute them.\"",
    "“It’s not a criminal investigation,\" Rep. Adam Schiff told the Times, \"But having experienced former prosecutors who know how to run complex, white-collar investigations working on a plot to overturn the presidential election is a very useful talent among your team.” And that's particularly true when you're facing a wall of obstruction thrown up by the former president and his cronies.",
    "\"It is highly unusual for congressional investigators to target a family member of a president,\" the outlet writes of her invitation to speak to the Committee, as if Princess Goya von Nepotism and her idiotic husband didn't voluntarily install themselves in the West Wing despite their total lack of qualifications and inability to qualify for a security clearance.",
    "Short, who is currently leading an astroturf outfit dedicated to \"protecting\" American workers by lowering corporate taxes, got a lot of attention for his comment that \"unfortunately the president had many bad advisers, who were basically snake oil salesmen giving him really random and novel ideas as to what the vice president could do.\"",

    "The January 6 Select Committee members have been busy bees of late, racing toward the midterms on the operating assumption that there's a good chance Republicans take back the gavel and shut the whole thing down in 2023.",
    "Let's give Chuck Todd half credit, though, for noting that there could have been a bipartisan multi-cameral congressional inquiry into the Capitol Riot, but GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell torpedoed it.",
    "\"As a senior adviser to her father, she also had a perch close to power,\" the article concedes, before going on to describe her efforts to persuade her father to call off the mob he himself summoned on January 6.",
    "But aside from letting Trump off the hook for his blatant attempt to foment a coup, Short followed it up by insisting that \"Donald Trump has an incredibly important voice in the Republican Party moving forward.\"",

    "\"I think it's very different to subpoena a former vice president to talk about private conversations he had with the president of the United States.",
