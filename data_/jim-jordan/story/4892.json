    "Ron DeSantis, Republican senators Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, and Representatives Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, Lauren Boebert, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene — in building buzz for the star of the circus, former President Donald Trump.",
    "She’s becoming a fixture on Fox News, while recently blasting the Biden administration in terms that would make even some Republicans blanch:\nBiden chose Harris as his VP because of the color of her skin and sex—not qualification.",
    "Gabbard launched her 2020 campaign with an apology for her past anti-LGBTQ views and closed it with a robust endorsement of Joe Biden for president, speaking to her affection for his late son Beau.",
