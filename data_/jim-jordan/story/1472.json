Marjorie Taylor Greene—the walking id of MAGA-America—tweeted about them, saying “Murkowski, Collins, and Romney are pro-pedophile.”\nMeanwhile, defenders of Florida’s new “don’t say gay” law, which strictly limits public school teachers’ ability to discuss LGBTQ people and issues in the classroom, began referring to the legislation as an “anti-grooming” bill—evoking the deeply homophobic idea that an adult would only talk about these topics with a child in order to prime them for abuse.",

    "3 Republican in the House, said it was a “totally unified decision all around.”\nThis all unfolded in the face of credible allegations that Jordan not only knew about the abuse at Ohio State, but had responded to multiple students who told him about it with comments like “If he tried that on me, I would kill him.” By all accounts, Strauss’ behavior was an open secret.",
    "Also in 2018, Rep. Jim Jordan, one of Trump’s fiercest allies and a co-founder of the hardline conservative Freedom Caucus, became embroiled in a scandal over his time as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University, where a team doctor named Richard Strauss, who committed suicide in 2005, was found to have sexually abused more than 177 male student athletes.",
    "A former ref also filed a lawsuit alleging that he complained to Jordan and another coach after Strauss masturbated in front of him, and they merely responded, “Yeah, that’s Strauss.”\nJordan claims that he was cleared of any wrongdoing in the official report by Ohio State’s investigators, which did not mention his name.",
    "During the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in March, Republican Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz attempted to smear the nominee by inaccurately claiming that she had a record of handing out unusually light sentences in cases where defendants were accused of viewing child pornography.",

    "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said last year he wouldn’t punish Gaetz or strip him of any committee assignments unless charges are filed, because Gaetz is “innocent until proven guilty.”\n“If it comes out to be true, yes, we would remove him if that’s the case,” McCarthy said at the time.",

    "During the 2018 midterms, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore was accused of preying on girls as young as 14 and 16; the New Yorker reported that his habit of trying to pick up high schoolers was so notorious that it actually got him banned from a local mall.",

    "Rather, the investigators wrote that, except in the case of one coach, they could not “identify any other contemporaneous documentary evidence” proving that athletic staff were aware of Strauss’s actions.",

    "Because American politics are now just one, long, low-rent nightmare, Republican culture warriors have spent the past few weeks slandering their various enemies as being soft on pedophilia.",
