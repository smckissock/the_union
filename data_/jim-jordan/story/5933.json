    "Topline\nThe House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is having trouble piecing together exactly whom former President Donald Trump spoke to on the day of the riot, according to the New York Times, since Trump often avoided using secure White House telephones despite known security risks, making calls on his personal cellphone and those of aides.",
    "Trump reportedly spoke with several members of Congress on January 6, 2021, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whose call turned into a screaming match as McCarthy demanded that Trump condemn the rioters.",
    "Key Facts\nAccording to the Times, citing two sources with knowledge of the investigation, few call records have been found in White House phone logs from the day of the riot, but it’s known that Trump was on the phone numerous times as his supporters forced their way into the Capitol.",
    "The gaps could be filled in by call records the committee has subpoenaed from telecom companies for cellphones of a number of people in Trump’s circle, including former chief of staff Mark Meadows, his son Eric Trump and Kimberley Guilfoyle, the fiancée of son Donald Trump Jr.",
    "The National Archives said Monday it retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago after what appeared to be a violation of the Presidential Records Act, which mandates presidents hand over records at the end of their terms.",
    "News reports throughout Trump’s presidency stated he preferred to use his personal phone even though it was more vulnerable to being hacked or otherwise compromised, potentially posing a threat to national security.",
    "Trump has denied any wrongdoing by keeping the records, but the National Archives is reportedly pressing for a criminal probe in the matter and the House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation.",
    "What the committee’s received so far suggests the Trump Administration had serious lapses in maintaining public records, with some documents reportedly having been ripped up and taped back together.",
    "According to Axios, an upcoming book from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman details how wads of documents were allegedly found clogging a White House toilet during the Trump Administration.",
    "The committee has been able to access phone logs and other White House records after the Supreme Court last month struck down Trump’s attempt to block the release of the records.",
    "It's believed the lack of records is the result of Trump falling into an old habit against which he’d been repeatedly advised: using his personal cellphone to make calls.",
    "Trump also didn’t turn over all of his White House records after his presidency ended, instead having some documents shipped to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
    "Trump called the claim “categorically untrue.”\nNational Archives Took 15 Boxes Of White House Records From Mar-A-Lago—Which Should Have Never Been There (Forbes)",
    "There’s no evidence that White House records have been tampered with or deleted, according to the Times."
