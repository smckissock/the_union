    "And now, we find out these text messages and emails that link the entire family, not just Hunter and Joe and — but also uncle, the — Joe’s brother, James Biden, is involved in this as well.”\nBartiromo brought up that author Peter Schweizer said the laptop includes messages from Hunter that show at least $31 million in shady international dealings, as well as a 2019 message to his daughter complaining about covering family expenses.",
    "Jordan, who is the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, remarked how “interesting” it is that the “story has evolved” in recent weeks, coinciding with rising suspicions that President Joe Bidsen himself could be drawn into a federal criminal investigation, even as the White House has been adamant in asserting that the president is not involved and that his 52-year-old son did not commit any crimes.",
    "You don’t see the Washington Post do that.”\nWhile the New York Post led the charge in reporting on the contents of the abandoned laptop, which contained emails detailing Biden’s business dealings and rollercoaster personal life, other major media outlets sought to cast doubt on its authenticity, and Big Tech companies even took steps to suppress its spread in the final weeks of the 2020 election.",
    "Top House Republican Jim Jordan said on Sunday he thinks “something is up” with the MSM’s recent flip-flop on the Hunter Biden laptop story – which was originally branded as Russian disinformation right before the 2020 US election, only to be validated as authentic in recent weeks amid a grand jury investigation into the First Son.",
    "-Washington Examiner\n“Remember, it started off as, ‘Oh, it wasn’t his laptop.’ Then it was, ‘Well, it was his laptop, but it was Russian disinformation.’ Now it’s, ‘No, it wasn’t Russian disinformation, but Joe had nothing to do with it,” Jordan continued.",
    "“And now, finally, it is, ‘Well, Joe had something to do with it, but he really didn’t do anything wrong.’ In fact, that’s what his chief of staff, Ron Klain, told us last Sunday on the Sunday shows,” he added.",
    "So two eight-page-long stories four minutes apart from the news organization that said 18 months ago there was no story here, this was Russian disinformation.",
    "Jordan pointed to the remarkable timing of MSM outlets reporting on Hunter’s laptop in seeming lockstep, which coincides with a flurry of grand jury activity.",
    "TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n“You mentioned those two stories from the Washington Post 10 days ago,” Jordan told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo.",
    "According to Jordan, it “sure seems” that Hunter is on his way to being indicted – though he couldn’t say for sure, according to the Washington Examiner.",
    "“I hope you all can do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family for 30 years,” said Hunter.",
    "But don’t worry, unlike pop, I won’t make you give me half your salary.”\nRead More @ ZeroHedge.com",
    "“I understand they were four minutes apart.",
    "“So, my, how this story has changed.",
    "That tells you something is up.",
    "“It’s really hard.",
    "One was at 11:00.",
    "One was at 11:04."
