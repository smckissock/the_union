    "All the while, the Kansan, who’s always eager to remind folks of his medical background has pushed Covid-19 rhetoric that “defies medical consensus“ and places him “closer to the medical fringe.”\nLast month, while pushing an odd conspiracy theory, Marshall badgered Dr. Anthony Fauci to put financial disclosure information online that was already online.",
    "Maybe we need to be proactive.”\nAs part of the same interview, the senator added that he intends to work with Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Republican Rep.

    "The Kansas City Star reported:\nKansas Sen. Roger Marshall said Sunday he may sponsor legislation requiring President Joe Biden to take an annual mental test, suggesting that the President’s cognitive capacity is in decline.",
    "We could also note that Republicans were unsubtle in pushing a similar line in 2020, right up until Biden scored the biggest win for a challenger against an incumbent president since FDR.",
    "By the summer, Marshall was calling on the president to “resign immediately.” By the fall, he was partnering with far-right allies on a government shutdown scheme over vaccine policies.",
    "After former Sen. Pat Roberts announced his retirement in Kansas ahead of the 2020 election cycle, plenty of Republicans saw a unique opportunity and launched statewide campaigns.",
    "Recommended\nThe Republican establishment rallied behind Marshall, a physician and sitting congressman, whom they saw as far more “normal” than the far-right Kobach.",
    "As Republican optimism grows about this year’s midterm elections, GOP leaders continue to face awkward questions about the party’s complete lack of a policy agenda.",
    "The result is a question the political world should grapple with in more detail: Is there still much of a line separating the GOP fringe from the GOP mainstream?",

    "He has no medical training in making cognitive assessment of people by way of television appearances.",
    "But for now, let’s put all of that aside and focus less on the message and more on the messenger.",
    "“I think we’re all concerned for President Biden’s mental health,” Marshall said.",
