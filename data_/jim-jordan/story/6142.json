    "It is the nature of some elements of politics, bigger than any party or moment in time\n— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) February 10, 2022\nIt is easy to assume that Gaetz wasn’t really talking about killing Kevin McCarthy, but after his participation in Trump’s coup and a violent attack on the Capitol, the threat that Rep. Gaetz made should not be ignored.",
    "As soon as McCarthy doesn’t do what the insurrection supporters want, they are going to force him out, and it is widely suspected that he will be replaced by Rep. Jim Jordan,\nMatt Gaetz is likely to be criminally charged soon with multiple felonies related to child sex trafficking, so he may not be around to get rid of McCarthy.",
    "It makes sense that a political party that supports domestic terrorism has no problem with one of its members threatening the House Minority Leader.",

    "Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) gave his philosophy on leadership and ended with a veiled death threat against Kevin McCarthy.",
    "— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) February 10, 2022\nSo he partners with a younger cheetah male – takes him under his wing.",
    "Gaetz’s tweets align with the RNC’s belief that the Capitol attack was legitimate political discourse.",
    "Here the alpha cheetah organizes 4 other males to join together for unprecedented success.",
    "The right-wing radicals in the House GOP caucus are not afraid of McCarthy.",
    "And the 4 bros he organized and led for years…find him and kill him.",
    "Gaetz tweeted:\nThis isn’t about any one leader or time period.",
    "This is the cruel nature of the animal kingdom.",
    "Through tough territory he makes good choices.",
    "The MOMENT he looks weak they drive him out.",
    "They do not respect him.",
    "Matt Gaetz laid it out.",
    "It’s about a dynamic.",
    "They are prosperous."
