    "Sponsored Links\nTucker Carlson, who is also at Fox News, has for weeks used the build-up of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine to score cheap partisan points against the Biden administration, characterizing the Russian invasion as a “border dispute” and asking viewers to rethink their ill feelings toward Putin, asking “Has Putin ever called me a racist?",
    "“Listen, he’s taking over a country, really a vast, vast location,” said Trump, “a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in.”\nThere are unapologetic and unhinged lunatics in the Republican Party like Arizona State Senator Wendy Davis, who tweeted “Zelensky is a globalist puppet for Soros and the Clintons”.",

    "Others like alleged pedophile Matt Gaetz will always find an opportunity to behave like internet trolls and now mock the idea that Americans should assist Ukrainians in the defense of their country.",
    "Just this Saturday, Trump defended calling Putin “smart” at the Conservative Political Action Conference, while claiming that “our leaders are dumb” and that “Putin is playing Biden like a drum”.",
    "However, if it’s a far-right authoritarian, DeSantis will hide and his spokesperson will offer the hypocritical defense that his silence is due to him being “the Governor of Florida”.",
    "Trump even likened the Russian invasion to a real estate deal, praising at a fundraiser dinner Putin’s unilateral declaration of independence for two eastern provinces of Ukraine.",
