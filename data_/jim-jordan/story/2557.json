    "You can hardly blame Bostelman for genuinely believing that Nebraska kids are crapping in litter boxes when the very top Republicans in the nation insist there's a secret computer in Ukraine that contains all of Hillary Clinton's election crimes, or that China has been shipping fake presidential ballots into the United States but because it's China those ballots are made of bamboo (you can totally tell from the \"fibers\"), or that the world's doctors are keeping you from sucking down tubes of livestock dewormer because they dON't WAnT yOu TO kNoW that the pandemic that's killed 1 million Americans and counting can be easily treated with ingredients from your local farm supply store.",
    "You cannot make me, and none of us deserve to live in a world in which we must simultaneously reckon with a worldwide pandemic, international war, and the insides of Republican heads as they contemplate how \"furries,\" whatever Republicans think they might be, relate to critical race theory, or The Socialisms, or Your Homeowner Association Bylaws, or (checks notes) how our children are crapping in litter boxes these days because our public school teachers have gone too far.",
    "Nebraska state Sen. Bruce Bostelman, a Republican, is now apologizing after going on an emotional tirade about how our children are becoming \"something called furries,\" dressing up as animals and demanding they be allowed to crap in litter boxes like cats rather than using their school's more traditional bathroom accommodations—a demand, Bostelman believes, schools are now abiding by.",
    "Bostelman quickly became the newest internet laughingstock, thank God, and so hours later reversed himself after he claimed to have \"checked into the claims\" with the Democratic head of the state senate's Education Committee and confirmed that no, children are not allowed to crap into designated litter boxes if they tell teachers they identify as animals.",
    "We will check through all our emails, deleting the ones that insist to us that the weird scammers of Project Veri-whatever or the National Rifle Association's Wayne LaGriftyGrift are on the cusp of another amazing discovery and/or redemption, and we will do it day after day because that is the job that has been entrusted to us.",
    "He stood up there with quite a bit of conviction demanding that this thing not happen if it was happening, and in his mind the public school crapocolypse was an urgent enough matter that he had to address it in front of the cameras before taking the step of doing any research on whether or not it was true.",
    "Which is, of course, exactly how the Republican Party ended up in the litter box to begin with: a complete unwillingness to distinguish between reality and asinine hoaxes, especially if the asinine hoaxes fit into whatever \"narrative\" about Our Kids Today the party most intends to thump on.",

    "We are not going to talk about \"fursonas,\" or the conventions, or the costumes, and anyone who wants to Google that shit can do it on their own time in a private browser window and leave the rest of us right the hell out of it.",
    "I am old enough to remember people taking Ann Coulter seriously, and unlucky enough to have been in a room while Louie Gohmert pushed conspiracy theories about the United Nations coming to reeducate your kids.",

    "It’s a recent internet hoax that has now snared many gullible conservatives who, for some reason, continue to be absolutely transfixed by any internet rumors that involve children's nether regions.",
