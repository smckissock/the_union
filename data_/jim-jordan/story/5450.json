    "\"Giuliani is prepared to make exceptions in instances where the panel can demonstrate that meetings with Trump that would have otherwise been subject to those protections might have been broken, and that the protections should not apply,\" Lowell notes, adding later that the committee may be willing to agree in principle to some of the lawyer's demands due to his \"penchant for sometimes revealing too much.\"",
    "People like Alex Jones, Mike Lindell, and Mike Flynn can sue the committee, but if Rudy starts flapping his yap about what went down at the Willard International Hotel when those idiots huddled up and tried to destroy democracy, then it doesn't matter if a handful of them want to spend six months getting smacked around by a federal judge before being ordered to comply.",

    "And now a guy who's famously leaky and ungoverned is going to sit down in a room with Adam Schiff, Liz Cheney, and Bennie Thompson.",
    "Although Mark Meadows did invent a new category of dumbass by handing over thousand of pages of communications — hey, Sean Hannity!",
    "Would it have come to this if Trump hadn't cut Rudy off and refused to pay him for his services, much less cover his legal bills?",
    "His obituary photo will either feature him leaking hair dye or standing in a landscaper's parking lot across from a porno store.",
    "Only Steve Bannon was stupid enough to defy the subpoenas completely and get himself charged with contempt of Congress.",
    "According to The Guardian, Rudy Giuliani is about to pull out his chram for the House January 6 Select Committee.",
