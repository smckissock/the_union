    "In an interview on “The Truth with Lisa Boothe” podcast, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) listed investigations he intends to prioritize should the Republican Party win a majority of seats in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections.",
    "Republican members of the House of Representatives have been highly critical of Mayorkas for not adequately addressing the seemingly perpetual immigration crisis at the country’s southern border with Mexico.",
    "As it currently stands, the GOP has an 85% chance of retaking the House of Representatives and a 73% chance of retaking the Senate, according to MarketWatch.",
    "The DOJ started this process shortly after a letter from the National School Boards Association prompted the President to protect them from accountability.",
    "Upon the Republican Party becoming the majority, he is positioned to become the committee’s chairman.",
    "As chairman, Jordan will be able to determine how the committee spends its time and resources.",
