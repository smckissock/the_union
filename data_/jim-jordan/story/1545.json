    "Vanity Fair’s Katherine Eban uncovered how EcoHealth Alliance operated in a world of “murky grant agreements, flimsy oversight, and the pursuit of government funds for scientific advancement, in part by pitching research of steeply escalating risk.”\nHere’s more on this story:\n[Vanity Fair’s Katherine Eban’s] report delves deep inside EcoHealth Alliance, showing how the group’s president, Peter Daszak, spent years wooing Fauci — at times literally at D.C. cocktail parties — to win federal support for gain-of-function studies at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese lab central to the lab-leak hypothesis of COVID-19’s origins.",
    "The fundamental questions concerning COVID-19 are whether EcoHealth Alliance paid for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab — experiments that make viruses deadlier and more infectious to humans — and whether Chinese scientists, either with federal funding from EcoHealth Alliance or on their own, engineered the SARS-CoV-2 virus before it somehow escaped the laboratory and caused a global pandemic, killing more than six million people.",
    "Is it your belief based on the evidence, senator, that he lied before Congress and broke the law?”\nPaul responded, “Yes, and I will be sending a letter to the Department of Justice asking for a criminal referral because he has lied to Congress.” Video circulated online of Facui “literally shaking” as Paul confronted him with explosive allegations about past statements.",
    "Early analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was 96.2% similar to a previously discovered bat coronavirus, which led many scientists to believe the most likely origin for COVID-19 was that it hopped from bats to humans, possibly through an intermediary animal.",
    "Fauci, in turn, worked with Daszak, Collins, and other top virologists to lead a well-documented campaign discrediting the lab-leak theory, all the while never being completely transparent about their potential conflicts of interest should the theory prove true.",
    "The study had shown it was possible to manipulate a SARS-like bat coronavirus in a laboratory setting so that it would infect human cells, which researchers believed showed the danger that such a virus could naturally evolve to threaten humans.",
    "“Fauci molded his denial to include the qualifier that nothing that was funded could have possibly led to the pandemic (as if that would excuse handing money to the Chinese communists for gain-of-function research),” RedState reported.",
    "A new investigative report, published by Vanity Fair, finds that CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield initially told Fauci to vigorously investigate both the lab-leak and natural origins theories of virus in early 2020.",
    "Paul has asserted that the NIH funded a gain-of-function grant to EcoHealth Alliance titled “Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.” It was partially carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",
    "“I personally felt it wasn’t biologically plausible that [SARS CoV-2] went from bats to humans through an [intermediate] animal and became one of the most infectious viruses to humans,” he told Vanity Fair.",
    "“We’ve released never before seen emails showing Dr. Fauci may have concealed information about #COVID19 originating from the Wuhan lab & intentionally downplayed the lab leak theory,” the statement reads.",
    "Dr. Fauci and Collins reportedly believed that the lab leak theory could implicate the NIH’s financial support for the non-governmental group EcoHealth Alliance and risky bat virus research in China.",
    "Redfield was aware of a 2015 gain-of-function study funded by EcoHealth Alliance and published by Wuhan lab scientist Dr. Zhengli Shi with University of North Carolina virus expert Dr. Ralph Baric.",
    "Redfield questioned whether scientists in Wuhan had gone on to carry out gain-of-function experiments on their own, at a laboratory with insufficient security and little international oversight.",
    "As the Chinese government worked to cover up the spread of COVID-19 in late 2019 and through the new year, Trump administration officials desperately sought to learn how the pandemic started.",
    "pic.twitter.com/p8aIBJ3nom\n— Oversight Committee Republicans (@GOPoversight) January 11, 2022\nIt’s already been proven that Dr. Fauci has lied to the American people on a variety of issues.",
    "Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Rand Paul, “You kicked off your questioning of Dr. Fauci emphasizing federal law makes lying to Congress a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.",
    "We've released never before seen emails showing Dr. Fauci may have concealed information about #COVID19 originating from the Wuhan lab & intentionally downplayed the lab leak theory.",
    "Under Fauci’s tenure at NIAID, EcoHealth Alliance received a $3.7 million federal grant in 2014 to study the potential for a deadly new coronavirus to emerge from wild bats in China.",
    "Here’s Rand Paul pointing out that he was right and Fauci lied:\nSurprise surprise – Fauci lied again\nAnd I was right about his agency funding novel Coronavirus research at Wuhan.",
    "Former National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins also strongly pushed back against scientists who raised legitimate questions about the origins of the virus.",
    "And unique features of the virus led some of the world’s top virologists, including those associated with Fauci, to raise the possibility that it was laboratory-engineered.",
    "Leaked emails show that Fauci lied to Americans by downplaying the role played by the Wuhan lab in China as well as the lab leak theory for the origins of the coronavirus.",
    "However, Fauci reportedly pushed back against the possibility of the lab leak theory, denouncing it as a conspiracy theory and waging a PR campaign to shut it down.",
    "The group partnered with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, sub-awarding the lab $600,000 in federal funds, to collect virus samples from bats and analyze them.",
    "Republican Rep. James Comer and Jim Jordan say they “want Fauci under oath,” adding that its “time for answers.” Here’s a look at Fauci’s emails:\n??BREAKING??",
    "The investigate report analyzes more than 100,000 internal EcoHealth documents, interviewing five former staff members, and speaking with 33 other sources.",
    "Three months ago, we learned about Dr. Anthony Fauci’s involvement in a cover-up scandal that allowed politics to interfere with the science and the truth.",
    "In July, Sen. Rand Paul announced that he referred Dr. Anthony Fauci to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation after Fauci lied to Congress.",
    "The gain-of-function experiments were carried out in Baric’s laboratory in North Carolina, but the Chinese scientists had learned his techniques.",
    "The House Oversight Committee in Congress confirmed this information in a statement that alleges Dr. Fauci concealed information from Americans.",
    "In early 2020, the deadly COVID-19 pandemic would be traced back to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, near where the lab is located.",
    "After the pandemic began, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield asked those questions.",
    "This proves that the NIH funded gain-of-function research on coronaviruses via EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan lab.",
    "Paul alleges that Fauci lied to Congress about funding dangerous gain-of-function research.",
    "“Fauci simply lied to a Senate committee and to the American public,” the report added.",
    "In a written letter, Paul delivered the referral to Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
    "The Intercept has obtained 900 pages of documents on that research.",
    "However, an animal host for SARS-CoV-2 was never discovered.",
    "@RepJamesComer & @Jim_Jordan want Fauci under oath.",
    "— Rand Paul (@RandPaul) September 7, 2021",
    "Could that be where COVID-19 came from?",
    "Paul delivered on this promise.",
    "Time for answers.",
    "1/2??"
