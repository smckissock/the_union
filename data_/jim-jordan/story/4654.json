    "Specifically the special counsel was interested in whether Brennan pushed for a more blunt assessment of Russia's motivations\nTrump-era Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Monday that Brennan did brief then President Barack Obama and Vice President at the time Joe Biden in 2016 about the allegations Clinton was trying to 'fabricate' a link between Trump and Russia.",
    "The Government's evidence at trial will also establish that among the Internet data Tech Executive-1 and his associates exploited was domain name system ('DNS') Internet traffic pertaining to (i) a particular healthcare provider, (ii) Trump Tower, (iii) Donald Trump's Central Park West apartment building, and (iv) the Executive Office of the President of the United States ('EOP').",
    "'Contrary to the allegations in this recent filing, Mr. Joffe is an apolitical Internet security expert with decades of service to the U.S. Government who has never worked for a political party, and who legally provided access to DNS data obtained from a private client that separately was providing DNS services to the Executive Office of the President (EOP),' the statement said.",

    "Rather, the Special Counsel has again made a filing in this case that unnecessarily includes prejudicial—and false—allegations that are irrelevant to his Motion and to the charged offense, and are plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool,' write four lawyers from Latham & Watkins in their response.",
    "Igor Danchenko\nIGOR DANCHENKO\nThe 43-year-old Russian-born analyst was arrested in November 2021 in Virginia by federal agents assigned to Durham's special counsel and charged with five counts of lying to FBI agents about the sources he used in collecting information for Michael Steele, who is identified in the indictment only as 'UK Person-1'.",
    "As set forth in the Indictment, on Sept. 19, 2016 – less than two months before the 2016 U.S. Presidential election – the defendant, a lawyer at a large international law firm ('Law Firm-1') that was then serving as counsel to the Clinton Campaign, met with the FBI General Counsel (James Baker) at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
    "In a footnote the lawyers take on the notion that Sussmann was acting in concert with the Clinton campaign, saying the motion 'conveniently overlooks' the fact that Sussmann's meeting with a government agency 'happened well after the 2016 presidential election at a time when the Clinton Campaign had effectively ceased to exist.'",
    "The Steele dossier 'source', an attorney linked to Hillary and a lawyer in Mueller's probe: The accusations in Durham's investigation\nHILLARY CLINTON\nA recently revealed filing from Special Counsel John Durham alleged Hillary Clinton paid a lawyer to infiltrate Trump Tower and White House servers in the 2016 campaign and after.",
    "The Indictment also alleges that, beginning in approximately July 2016, Tech Executive-1 had worked with the defendant, a U.S. investigative firm retained by Law Firm-1 on behalf of the Clinton Campaign, numerous cyber researchers, and employees at multiple Internet companies to assemble the purported data and white papers.",
    "+24\nView gallery\nMichael Sussmann\nMICHAEL SUSSMANN\nIn September 2021, Durham indicted the cybersecurity lawyer, accusing him of lying to the FBI during a September 2016 conversation when relaying concerns about potentially suspicious cyber contacts between a Trump Organization server and the server of a Russian bank.",
    "The key passage of the Durham filing that led to the accusations against Clinton and her campaign\nBelow is the key part of the legal filing made by Special Counsel John Durham on Friday February 11 that led to the firestorm of claims that Hillary Clinton and her campaign spied on Donald Trump while he was President.",
    "Durham's indictment alleges that Sussmann told FBI General Counsel at the time James Baker in September 2016 that he was not working or 'any client' upon requesting a meeting to show evidence that he claimed 'demonstrated a covert communications channel' between the Trump Organization and the Kremlin Alfa Bank.",
    "'Rather, Mr. Sussmann has been charged with making a false statement about an entirely ancillary matter - about who his client may have been when he met with the FBI - which is a fact that even the Special Counsel's own Indictment fails to allege had any effect on the FBI's decision to open an investigation.'",
    "For example, the more complete data that Tech Executive-1 and his associates gathered – but did not provide to Agency-2 – reflected that between approximately 2014 and 2017, there were a total of more than 3 million lookups of Russian Phone-Provider-1 IP addresses that originated with U.S.-based IP addresses.",
    "In addition, the more complete data assembled by Tech Executive-1 and his associates reflected that DNS lookups involving the EOP and Russian Phone Provider-1 began at least as early 2014 (i.e., during the Obama administration and years before Trump took office) – another fact which the allegations omitted.",
    "When bringing the concerns to then-FBI general counsel James Baker, the indictment alleged that Sussmann lied and said he was not representing a client when he was actually hired by Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign\nSussmann has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers have claimed the case is driven by politics.",
    "The Government's evidence at trial will establish that these additional allegations relied, in part, on the purported DNS traffic that Tech Executive-1 and others had assembled pertaining to Trump Tower, Donald Trump's New York City apartment building, the EOP, and the aforementioned healthcare provider.",
    "'We can't get distracted, whether it's by the latest culture war nonsense, or some new right wing lie on Fox or Facebook - by the way they've been coming after me again lately in case you might have noticed,' Clinton told Democrats in a comeback speech at the party's nominating convention in New York.",
    "It also notes how former President Trump 'seized' upon the filing, and cites Trump statement that it 'provides indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia.'",
    "In fact, the defendant had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including (i) a technology executive ('Tech Executive-1 - identified as Rodney Jeffe) at a U.S.-based Internet company ('Internet Company1'), and (ii) the Clinton Campaign.",
    "'These allegations were not included in the Indictment; these allegations post-date the single false statement that was charged in the Indictment; and these allegations were not necessary to identify any of the potential conflicts of interest with which the Motion is putatively concerned.",
    "'If third parties or members of the media have overstated, understated, or otherwise misinterpreted facts contained in the Government's Motion, that does not in any way undermine the valid reasons for the Government’'s inclusion of this information,' a court filing from Thursday said.",
    "Durham, in his Feb. 11th filing, said Sussmann ' had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1) at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign.'",
    "'To make this case a partisan affair and to inflame media coverage, the Special Counsel chose to include allegations that Mr. Sussmann was part of a wide-ranging scheme involving a number of uncharged parties including the Clinton Campaign, Law Firm-1, Campaign Lawyer-1, a U.S.",

    "Secret Service had parked outside of the restaurant while they are inside filming\nPrior to Durham's Thursday filing, Sussmann's legal team said Durham 'seems to be succeeding in his effort to instigate unfair and prejudicial media coverage of Mr. Sussmann's case.'",
    "They also claim his statement to Baker 'cannot give rise to criminal liability' because he 'voluntarily' met with the FBI in fall 2016 to 'pass along information that raised national security concerns' and the indictment is based on a separate 'ancillary matter'.",
    "Danchenko, 43, was the primary researcher for Steele's dossier alleging that Trump's 2016 presidential campaign conspired with Russia in a covert operation to beat Hillary Clinton, and that Russia had salacious videos that could be used to blackmail Trump.",
    "Those statements came when Sussmann met with the FBI in September 2016 and provided the FBI's general counsel with data and white papers 'that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel between the Trump Organization and a Russia-based bank.'",
    "In his meeting with Agency-2, the defendant provided data which he claimed reflected purportedly suspicious DNS lookups by these entities of internet protocol ('IP') addresses affiliated with a Russian mobile phone provider ('Russian Phone Provider-1').",
    "The latest motion to dismiss comes after Sussmann's lawyers on Tuesday accused Durham of adding inflammatory accusations to a legal filing purely to 'taint' the jury pool and 'inflame' the media by using language that suggested Clinton spied on Trump.",
    "The Indictment further details that on February 9, 2017, the defendant provided an updated set of allegations – including the Russian Bank-1 data and additional allegations relating to Trump – to a second agency of the U.S. government ('Agency-2').",
    "'As an initial matter, defense counsel has presumed the Government’s bad faith and asserts the Special Counsel’s Office intentionally sought to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool,' Durham's Thursday filing said.",
    "In compiling and disseminating these allegations, the defendant and Tech Executive-1 also had met and communicated with another law partner at Law Firm-1 who was then serving as General Counsel to the Clinton Campaign ('Campaign Lawyer-1').",
    "Special Counsel John Durham said Thursday night he wasn't trying to 'politicize' or 'inflame media coverage' in his case against indicted Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann with last Friday's filing that led to spying claims.",
    "The filing says that among the data the tech executive and his associates 'exploited' was DNS traffic to a healthcare provider, Trump Tower, a Trump-owned apartment building and the Executive Office of the President of the United States.",
    "Tech Executive-1 also enlisted the assistance of researchers at a U.S.-based university who were receiving and analyzing large amounts of Internet data in connection with a pending federal government cybersecurity research contract.",

    "'Court filings by Special Counsel Durham suggesting the Clinton campaign may have engaged in an orchestrated effort to infiltrate the Trump campaign are unacceptable and should not be swept under the rug,' Graham said on Tuesday.",
    "July 25, 2019 – Trump held his infamous phone call with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, revealing Trump may have referred to the Durham probe when he asked Kyiv for help and insisted Zelensky speak with Barr and Rudy Giuliani.",
    "Indeed, more complete DNS data that the Special Counsel's Office obtained from a company that assisted Tech Executive-1 in assembling these allegations reflects that such DNS lookups were far from rare in the United States.",
    "What set off a firestorm, however, was in Durham's filing last Friday he says that a Sussman was working with a tech executive who asked researchers to 'mine Internet data' to establish the now infamous Trump-Russia link.",

    "'With the revelations that Trump was indeed spied on during 2016 and deep into his presidency it is time for anyone complicit in this crime resign from the Biden Administration and be charged.",
