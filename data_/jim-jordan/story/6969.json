    "Hannity said that he was recently informed that DeSantis indicated that there was not “any conflict or bickering” between the two and that it was “total BS” manufactured by the media.",
    "I think Ron said last week, he said it very publicly, he says the press is never going to get in the middle of my friendship with Donald Trump, we’re not going to do that stuff.",
