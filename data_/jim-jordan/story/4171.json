    "According to Jordan, this is particularly necessary because Fauci and the CDC knew “from the get-go knew [coronavirus] came from the lab, likely came from a lab, gain of function likely done, and our tax dollars were used.”\nThe genesis of the coronavirus pandemic has been a hotly contested issue for two years, with initial inquiries into a possible lab leak or intentional manufacturing of the virus being labeled “misinformation” and a “conspiracy theory.”\nWhile independent media outlets, including LifeSiteNews, consistently raised the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic initiated from a lab, it was not until mid-2021 that mainstream media outlets began to acknowledge it as a possibility.",
    "According to emails between American and British scientists, top researchers privately acknowledged it was “likely” that COVID-19 escaped from a laboratory but feared publicly admitting as much would undermine “science and international harmony.”\nJust last month, The Telegraph reported that Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the London-based Wellcome Trust, emailed Fauci and then-National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins on February 2, 2020 to posit rapid evolution in a low-security lab, “accidentally creat[ing] a virus primed for rapid transmission between humans,” as a “likely explanation” for COVID’s origin.",
    "In a statement Tuesday to Just the News on Capitol Hill, Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, says he intends to pursue a formal investigation into “all the lies [and] the misinformation, the disinformation” perpetuated by Fauci and the CDC in regard to the COVID-19 so-called pandemic if Republicans gain a majority in the House of Representatives in November.",
    "Furthering public distrust of the health authorities, just last week The New York Times ran a story confirming that the CDC intentionally withheld data pertaining to COVID-19 vaccines for more than a year because they feared the public would “misinterpret” the data.",
    "WASHINGTON, D.C. (LifeSiteNews) — Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio says investigations into Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) need to become a top priority if Republicans get control of the House after the 2022 midterm elections.",
    "The CDC has also been repeatedly accused of failing to adequately warn people about serious known risks from the jabs, including the elevated risk of potentially fatal heart inflammation in teens and young adults after mRNA vaccination.",
    "“Withholding data is scientific fraud.”\nIn addition to withholding data, the CDC has been criticized repeatedly for failing to investigate serious adverse events and to make public the numbers of reports of vaccine injuries to the U.S.",
    "“I share your view that a swift convening of experts in a confidence-inspiring framework is needed or the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony,” Collins replied.",
    "The CDC left out data on a huge swath of the population, those ages 18-49, when it published the first significant data on the effectiveness of boosters in adults younger than 65 two weeks ago.",
    "“This meets the criteria of scientific fraud,” Dr. Robert Malone, a key inventor of the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, told World Net Daily.",
    "People in this age group would be those least likely to benefit from booster shots, and it dramatically skewed the impression of the data.",
    "VAERS now registers 1,071,856 adverse events, including nearly 35,000 injuries in children ages 5-17.",
