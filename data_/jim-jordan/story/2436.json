    "After initially vowing to seek a committee gavel next year instead of pursuing another term as GOP conference chairwoman, Stefanik has spent the past few months quietly laying the groundwork to remain in a leadership role after the midterm elections, according to interviews with over a dozen GOP lawmakers and aides.",
    "Last year's gathering was overshadowed by internal leadership drama, with Republicans incensed that Cheney publicly broke with McCarthy over a bipartisan January 6 commission and refused to rule out a 2024 presidential bid, leading the House GOP to ultimately replace her with Stefanik as the No.",
    "Stefanik and her team have also poured a lot of time and resources into building an app for the Republican conference, which sources say will serve as an internal messaging tool but could also have some public-facing components and is expected to be rolled out sometime this year.",
    "The early leadership jockeying -- not just from Stefanik, but from multiple Republicans across the conference in recent weeks -- comes as lawmakers will descend on Jacksonville, Florida, this Wednesday for their annual policy retreat, which is being organized by Stefanik.",
    "For her part, Stefanik dismissed the idea she has been positioning herself for any sort of leadership post next year, telling CNN she is solely focused on her job as conference chair, as well as helping the GOP win back a congressional majority this fall.",
    "Among the other names in the whip mix: Reps. Drew Ferguson of Georgia, the deputy whip; Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the House GOP's campaign arm; and Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the top Republican on the Financial Services Committee.",
    "One factor that helped Stefanik appease her conservative critics the last time she launched a leadership bid was her support from Trump, which could again come in handy if she pursues a higher-ranking leadership role inside the GOP conference.",
    "Stefanik has remained in close contact with the former President, who helped recruit her to run for conference chairwoman after her predecessor, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, voted to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6, 2021, insurrection.",
    "The desire to have his blessing is hardly surprising, given that Trump backed her initial bid to become the House GOP's chief messenger, but nonetheless shows that Stefanik views his continued support as essential for her future in the party.",
    "Months before she became conference chairwoman, Stefanik voted against the Equality Act, which intends to protect people from being discriminated against based on sexual orientation and gender identity, despite supporting the bill in 2019.",
    "Stefanik has earned chits with her colleagues by building a sizable war chest, including announcing a recent $1 million transfer to the House GOP's campaign committee, and by working to elect more Republican women through her Elevate PAC.",
    "To keep Trump in her good graces, Stefanik has trekked to his properties at least twice in the past eight months: once for a fundraiser at his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort and then again this winter for another fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "But the prospect of a looming leadership shuffle may be impossible to ignore, with Republicans excited about their chances of winning back the majority and many GOP lawmakers beginning to privately whisper about what that might look like.",
    "She has also worked to win over some of her doubters on the right with her combative social media accounts, where she frequently attacks Democrats and the media, and a voting record that is more in line with the Republican conference.",
    "Stefanik has also recently spoken with Trump about her political aspirations and next moves, according to three sources familiar with the conversation, who said the former President has said encouraging things to her.",
    "\"There's been lots of rumblings in the last two weeks that she's got her sights on a higher position,\" said one GOP lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity to speak more freely about sensitive internal dynamics.",
    "When Stefanik was making her bid for conference chair last year, some conservatives were skeptical of her more moderate voting record, as well as how quickly McCarthy was working to install her in Cheney's place.",
    "McHenry was whip effectively for a while,\" said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who serves on McCarthy's leadership team, referring to when McHenry filled in for Scalise after he was shot at a GOP baseball practice.",
    "To quell some of those concerns, GOP lawmakers said Stefanik told them she would only serve one term as conference chairwoman and then intended to seek the top spot on the House Education and Labor Committee.",
    "There's been a lot of internal interest surrounding Stefanik's next moves, in part because she remains more of a mystery than McCarthy or Scalise and previously promised to limit her term as conference chair.",
    "He also pointed out that GOP leaders have the option of resurrecting another position -- chair of the Elected Leadership Committee -- which would create another opportunity for a seat at the leadership table.",

    "She has inquired about whether another lawmaker plans to run for that post in the majority, according to one source familiar with the conversation, in an effort to size up the potential competition.",
    "\"I don't always 100% agree with what leadership does or doesn't do but ... in my view, she's been honoring her commitment to run the conference as conference chair, and kind of check her votes.",
    "She also said in a separate statement that she supports McCarthy for speaker and Scalise for majority leader, tamping down any speculation she'd be gunning for anything higher than the No.",
    "\"I think Elise has worked hard to include people from across the conference,\" said conservative Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who unsuccessfully challenged Stefanik for conference chair.",

    "But the panel's current ranking member, Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, has been seeking a waiver to remain in that role next year, which could change Stefanik's calculus.",
    "Still, it's clear the moderate-turned-MAGA star aspires to move beyond her current role inside the House GOP -- and she's betting her Trump bona fides will help get her there.",
    "A person close to Trump said he has an \"affinity for her\" and \"they get along\" well, though he has relationships with all the top members of the Republican leadership team.",
    "When pressed by a reporter last week about the upcoming gathering and how it would compare to last year's intra-party feud, McCarthy responded: \"Won't see any fallout.\"",
    "\"I am proud to support him and be an integral part of his team working to earn a historic Republican Majority to save America and elect Speaker McCarthy next January.\"",
    "That would likely be an open -- and crowded -- race if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy becomes speaker and Minority Whip Steve Scalise ascends to majority leader.",
    "McCarthy and Stefanik have enjoyed a strong and close working relationship, while Stefanik noted she's served on Scalise's whip team since her first term in office.",

    "And she even outflanked McCarthy and Scalise on one occasion: last summer, Stefanik voted against a measure to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol.",
    "But the ambitious congresswoman is keeping her options open, and her next moves may ultimately depend on what the landscape looks like post-November.",

    "And the New York Republican is sizing up the political ambitions of her colleagues as she weighs decisions about her future.",
    "Stefanik's allies point out her district in New York has become redder, which might explain the shift in her voting record.",
    "It's also unclear if he would back anyone for a lower-ranking leadership position, especially if they are contested races.",
    "And the proof is in the polling: we've never been in a stronger position on every issue that's important to Americans.\"",

    "And the entire leadership has been working as a cohesive unit since Stefanik came on board.",
    "One post that the 37-year-old has her eyes on if Republicans retake the House is GOP whip.",
    "That interaction and Stefanik's interest in the whip job was first reported by Politico.",
    "And it wouldn't be unprecedented for a member to violate their self-imposed term limits.",
    "(Emmer and McHenry, who are both said to be interested in the whip position, did not).",
    "Privately, Republicans acknowledged they need a woman in the top rungs of leadership.",
    "The entire GOP leadership will appear alongside Trump in May for a Texas fundraiser.",
