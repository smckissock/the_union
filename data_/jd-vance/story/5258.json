    "Grellong, who has written for “Hawaii Five-O” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” manufactures a caricature of Harvard in which all anyone seems to care about is getting on “The Rachel Maddow Show.”\nThe most interesting character — which isn’t to say the most credible — is Lucas, whose unlikely research (a running gag) is on the “agrarian economy and practices of 17th century Sweden.” It’s not his scholarship but his right-wing long game that reenergizes this sluggish play.",
    "He argues not only from the standpoint of friendship but also from the broader principle that not everyone deserves a place at “the table where the grown-ups are talking.”\nLucas (Seth Numrich) and Maggie (Tedra Millan), two grad students vying for the same Harvard fellowship that launched Baxter’s career, are aligned in wanting to help their professor out of this mess.",
    "Extremists ought to be exposed, and Charles promises a “full dismantling.”\nAmy (Brenneman), his worried dean in full damage control mode, reminds him that Carver “cozies up to Klansmen.” She shows Charles the Boston Globe op-ed that calls him a neo-Nazi “apologist” and strongly urges him to reconsider giving a prestigious platform to a purveyor of hate.",
    "But as Charles unbudgingly argues, “The answer to hate speech is more speech.” He regularly whips out this slogan whenever he needs a shield — a sign that his motivation may not be as straightforward as it seems.",
    "Playing Charles Nichols in Paul Grellong’s “Power of Sail,” which opened Thursday at the Geffen Playhouse, Cranston embodies the weary petulance of a grizzled Harvard history professor whose star is in decline.",
    "In his Tony Award-winning performance as Lyndon B. Johnson in “All the Way,” Cranston brought the president’s vote-wrangling power to life with a Texas drawl, cocky slouch and inexhaustible lung power.",
    "Charles, a free-speech absolutist whose politics are more aligned with Rachel Maddow than with Tucker Carlson, has invited to campus a 31-year-old Nazi sympathizer and Holocaust denier named Carver.",
    "When she swats a stack of books onto the floor in a standoff with Maggie, who has improbably decided to take justice into her own hands, it’s as though her character has been demoted to melodrama.",
    "Baxter (Brandon Scott), a Black historian who was groomed by Charles and has now surpassed him in cultural prominence, shows up unannounced to try to stop him from sabotaging his reputation.",
    "Implausibly popping up at the behest of the playwright, he has a postcrisis confrontation with a drunk and desperate Charles that only exposes the dramatic emptiness of their relationship.",
    "As Howard Beale in the stage version of “Network,” he won another Tony for delivering an on-air nervous breakdown that was so visceral it’s amazing no one in the audience called 911.",
    "“Power of Sail,” a debate play on the hot topics of free speech and academic freedom, is something a cable news network looking to get into scripted television drama might dream up.",
    "The production, under the direction of Weyni Mengesha, wastes an enviable cast (that includes Amy Brenneman) on a play that’s part position paper, part political mystery.",
    "Tickets: $39-$149\nInfo: (310) 208-2028 or geffenplayhouse.org\nRunning time: 1 hour, 45 minutes (no intermission)\nCOVID protocol: Proof of full vaccination is required.",
    "These little physical details, incidental yet evocative, create a portrait that’s capable of distilling an entire personality in the neat trim of an academic’s beard.",
    "As Walter White in “Breaking Bad,” he never lost touch with the ravaged health that was driving this married chemistry teacher into acts of criminal desperation.",
    "Lucas, who makes throwaway remarks about being a “cis white male” at an elite institution, is cagier — and more in control than his skittish demeanor lets on.",
    "And in the most thankless role, Hugo Armstrong is granted an aimless scene as a bartender whose main characteristic is telling the world’s most feeble jokes.",
    "In registering the character’s contempt at anyone who would question his progressive bona fides, he takes on the character’s niggling aches and pain.",
    "Even with all her veteran wiles, Brenneman can’t make Amy, an academic institutionalist who acts more like a public relations executive, believable.",
    "But only Lucas, who’s always looking to exploit an opportunity for advancement, agrees to join him on a visit that will have shocking consequences.",
    "While waiting for a delayed Amtrak with one of his graduate students, he massages a bad knee — an arthritic reminder that time stops for no one.",
    "Where: Geffen Playhouse, 10886 Le Conte Ave., Los Angeles\nWhen: 8 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays, 3 and 8 p.m. Saturdays, 2 and 7 p.m. Sundays.",
    "Rachel Myers’ set conjures an Ivy League dream of book-lined shelves and Gothic archways, but the dramatic world is built on shadows.",
    "The scene on the train platform, in which Lucas slyly entices Charles to indulge in some white pride, is disturbingly fresh.",
    "Charles invites these students to accompany him to a planning dinner with Carver at his white nationalist compound.",
    "Donna Simone Johnson plays an FBI agent whose pauses are all pregnant and whose nods are consistently knowing.",
    "The logistics of the uncovered plot are as strained as the psychological explanation of Charles’ behavior.",
    "Scott’s Baxter is meant to be the rationalist in a sea of frothing fanatics, but he comes off as a cipher.",
    "Maggie wants Charles to attend a “safe space meet” with outraged students who have drawn her sympathy.",
    "Unfortunately, while Cranston is painting in oils, his playwright is diagramming in stick figures.",
    "The characters, at the service of an increasingly convoluted plot, must hang on for dear life.",
    "Numrich is an excellent actor, so I wish the role would have better packaged his deviousness.",
    "Having planted this clue, Grellong might be expected to probe deeply into Charles’ character.",
    "Coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum, however, they have different agendas.",
    "“Power of Sail” moves backward in time to account for how events disastrously conspired.",
    "It goes without saying that Cranston fleshes out every moment of stage time with truth.",
    "Instead, he ushers in other points of view while setting up a tangled web of intrigue.",
    "The other characters are all pawns in an argument presented from different angles.",
    "Complexity is the goal, but the drama is too manipulative to be enlightening.",
    "Apparently, he’s dying of envy of colleagues who have become MSNBC regulars.",
    "Students are loudly protesting on campus, but Charles refuses to back down.",
    "Academic jealousy is not something that should ever be underestimated.",
    "(The baffling title, derived from nautical law, is deterrent enough.)",
    "The stage should offer Cranston an opportunity to stretch his gifts.",
    "But this is a TV writer’s idea of a premier university.",
    "Universities shouldn’t be in the business of coddling.",
    "But why he’d settle for “Power of Sail” is a mystery.",
    "Bryan Cranston slips into his characters skin-first.",
    "Two other characters contribute to the distraction.",
    "But all subtlety is lost when this J.D.",
    "He sees the symposium as a statement.",
    "Vance knockoff takes off his mask.",
    "This play leaves him high and dry.",
