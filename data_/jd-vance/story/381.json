    "It took courage for Trump, during the GOP primaries, to question many of the Swamp Republicans’ most donor-beloved orthodoxies, from privatizing entitlements to endless war.",
    "Many other would-be populist contenders among the party’s new crop of interesting senators and senators-in-waiting succumbed to the pressure to endorse MOAAARRR war.",
    "Readers of his memoir, including liberals prepared to rise above their partisan hatred, will have glimpsed this quality in Hillbilly Elegy.",
    "For the discontent that propelled Trump to the White House in 2016 to be addressed, Vance must find his way into the halls of the Senate.",
    "Vance is an authentic representative of America’s populist tradition, contending against a field of establishment phonies.",
    "The Vance I’ve gotten to know over the past few years has something few politicians possess: namely, depth of soul.",
    "Likewise, it took (and takes) courage for Vance to question the pro-war uniparty’s rush to escalation in Ukraine.",
