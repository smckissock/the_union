    "Rep. Lance Gooden, a Texas Republican whose district has been overrun by the surge of illegal aliens, told Just the News founder John Solomon that Biden’s purposely-create border insecurity isn’t just impacting the border states; it’s spreading to the interior of America and threatening national security — driving the temptation to impeach the hapless Biden if the GOP regains control of Congress.",
    "Moreover, it’s not like Biden isn’t already on a downward slide regarding “the I-word.”\nAs my colleague Nick Arama reported, a Rasmussen poll released on January 31 found that fully 50 percent of likely voters backed impeaching Biden over his purposely-created Biden Border Crisis™ and the Biden Afghanistan Debacle™, with 45 percent opposing it.",
    "Vance, who is running for a Senate seat in Ohio — where drug overdoses tied to the Biden Border Crisis™ have surged — best summed up the legitimacy of impeaching Biden:\nThe thing that I think Biden has done that is genuinely unprecedented in the history of this country is to sanction, encourage and pay for an invasion of this country.",
    "We’re focused like a laser on the crises in America, and what I hear from voters even in my district in Northern New York — because I represent border patrol officers who have been transferred again and again and again to the southern border — is that the crisis after crisis is a catastrophe.",
    "This time, instead of Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats impeaching Donald Trump every 15 minutes on bogus trumped-up charges, a Republican majority appears more than like to impeach Joe Biden based on at least one legitimate charge: failing to secure the border of the United States.",
    "A lot of negative things I could say about Bill Clinton, but Bill Clinton did not allow an invasion on this scale, or actively encourage people to do it, even while the leading cause of death for communities, among young people, is the fentanyl they’re bringing in from Mexico.",
    "Erroneously so, I believe, because I do not believe Hispanic Americans will endure decades of Democrat lies and hollow promises, and dutifully line up election after election, year after year, decade after decade — without question or complaint — and pull the “D” lever.",
    "Now, as reported by Just the News, after Texas Rep. Ted Cruz first raised the issue in early January, the idea of impeaching Biden is gaining traction with a growing number of Republican lawmakers, as well — both in Congress and on the campaign trail.",
    "What I believe we should focus on is conducting oversight, and making sure that we’re passing legislation to secure the border once and for all and return the policies of the previous administration under President Trump.",
    "As Just the News noted, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Bob Gibbs of Ohio have already introduced articles of impeachment even knowing they won’t be considered as long as Democrats are in charge.",
    "Or should make, that is, come January 2023, after the Republican Party more than likely kicks Democrat ass in November and takes back control of the House — and hopefully the Senate — in January.",
    "When Republicans take back the House, we will take our commitment to the separation of powers, our role as a check and balance to the executive branch, seriously.",
    "Perhaps even more shocking, 50 percent of Black voters supported impeachment, which was also supported by one in three — 34 percent of — Democrat voters.",
    "The fact that our United States government is putting its own citizens behind those of other nations, and also encouraging human trafficking.",
    "Stefanik told Just the News the border crisis is now “inflaming her own state.”\nAnything is on the table when we are in the majority.",
    "As with everything Democrats support, oppose, propose or reject, it can be connected to the ballot box with no more than two dots.",
    "And I would support that, certainly,” Gooden said, drawing a contrast with the two-time Democrat-engineered impeachment of Trump.",
    "And even if the bar were raised exponentially, I believe that President Biden has met that requirement.",
    "President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the entire administration is [sic] officially on notice.",
    "And what we’re seeing [is] they’re filling the bank accounts and the cash stashes of the cartel.",
    "This is ridiculous, it’s traitorous conduct, and we need to do something about it.",
    "What we’re seeing at the border is not just criminal, but it is immoral.",
    "Even leaders like Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the No.",
    "“I really believe that impeachment could be on the table.",
    "3 Republican in the House, have come around to the idea.",
    "And the obscene hell of the Biden Border Crisis™?",
    "Rep. Lance Gooden’s interview with John Solomon:",
    "And this time, it doesn’t appear to be a train.",
    "And it’s not what this country should be about.",
    "But the message is clear, Gibbs said recently.",
    "The bar was so low to impeach President Trump.",
    "As Nick noted, the results were astounding.",
    "What a difference a midterm election makes.",
    "There is light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "This is a shot across the bow.",
    "It’s really a travesty.",
    "Newcomer J.D.",
    "Amen."
