    "“There’s an instinct toward being sort of okay with people like Putin,” Chafkin told me, “because they see him as being against the globalist order.”\nThe leader of the GOP, Donald Trump, spent years as president trying to align the United States with Putin’s interests and against those of Ukraine and the West.",
    "What’s really on display here is the ideological confusion that Putin’s invasion has unleashed among conservative populist nationalists such as Vance, and the effort by Republicans to determine what place in their party those ideological leanings will hold going forward.",
    "Does this mean the form of right-wing politics that Vance is dabbling in — the refusal to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion with undiluted moral clarity, the active disregard for Ukraine’s fate — is becoming a serious liability among Republicans?",
    "“The ideology is nationalistic, antiglobalist and authoritarian-curious.”\nChafkin suggested that this ideological inclination may translate into some sort of comfort level with financing a platform that carries Russian propaganda.",
    "But the right-wing nationalist worldview underlying that posture might be losing its pull among Republican voters, now that Putin’s invasion is showing the world the horrors of what that worldview really means.",
    "An appeal on his campaign website says, “Secure our Southern Border and NOT Ukraine’s Border!”\nThat ugly formulation is a widespread talking point among right-wing nationalists such as Vance and Carlson.",
    "After news of Vance’s speech broke, Brian McClung, who advised former Minnesota GOP governor Tim Pawlenty, tore into Vance as a “Putin apologist” and urged Republicans to boycott the dinner.",
    "Meanwhile, another prominent Minnesota political operative revealed that Republicans in the state were “fuming” over the choice of Vance, noting it came just after Russia’s invasion began.",
    "Vance’s Senate candidacy is struggling — he trails multiple GOP primary rivals — and it might ultimately get canceled entirely by GOP primary voters when they choose a nominee this spring.",
    "And it raises pressing questions about a larger phenomenon: The drift toward Putinism among some in the GOP, and the effort by other Republicans to paper it over or purge it outright.",
    "Those nationalists want Americans to see the most important threat to a nation’s sovereignty as the one posed to their own by immigration (or, more broadly, by globalization).",
    "Last month, Vance said, “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.”\nWhether this led to Vance’s cancellation is related to a larger unresolved issue.",
    "This is why the robust international response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused Vance and Carlson to lose their ideological footing.",
    "“For every dollar that goes to the Ukrainians, we should send three dollars to the American southern border.”\nVance has since gone further.",
    "While many Republicans support Ukraine and have condemned the invasion, few will fundamentally disavow Trump’s embrace of Putin.",
    "But Max Chafkin, author of a biography of Thiel, points to an ideological through line in the Vance-Thiel investment in Rumble.",
    "Underscoring the point, note that Vance’s Senate candidacy is underwritten by Peter Thiel, the antiglobalist tech billionaire.",
    "Why do they seem to be placing their hopes in a liberal international order that they should see as corrupt and irredeemable?",
    "Now Republicans are asking if Vance was canceled because of his controversial declaration about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",
    "Why, they must be asking, are all these Americans suddenly caring so much about a border thousands of miles from their own?",
    "As Swift notes:\nVance is also under fire for investing in the platform Rumble with his political sugar daddy, Peter Thiel.",
    "But too much solidarity with Ukraine and the internationalist response dangerously undermines their nationalist worldview.",
    "Both are investors in Rumble, which happens to carry Russian propaganda now that other tech platforms have curbed it.",
    "Vance was originally scheduled to be keynote speaker at an upcoming dinner held by the Minnesota Republican Party.",
    "Then, without any explanation, his speech was abruptly canceled, and the party replaced him with another speaker.",
    "But he also seemed to disparage the international response, insisting we are “obsessing” over Ukraine’s travails.",
    "Vance also appeared with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson and grudgingly allowed that we should send “aid” to Ukraine.",
    "He did release a statement allowing that it’s a “tragedy.” But he vaguely blamed globalist “elites” for it.",
    "The party declined to comment to Jim Swift of the Bulwark, who has a useful overview of this controversy.",
    "Rumble, if you’re not familiar, is YouTube for those who have been “canceled” by Big Tech.",
    "They want Americans to see this as an emergency on a par with the invasion of Ukraine.",
    "They know they must express sympathy with Ukraine and horror over the invasion.",
    "So will Republican voters execute the final cancellation of Vance’s candidacy?",
    "Some prominent Republicans have condemned Vance’s shrug about Ukraine.",
    "“This business deal has an ideological component,” Chafkin told me.",
    "A fascinating mystery has arisen around Ohio Senate candidate J.D.",
    "If Vance loses his primary, that might be one reason why.",
    "“What about our sovereignty?” Vance said to Carlson.",
    "It would be unfair to blame Vance for financing RT.",
    "But the party has not said why it replaced Vance.",
    "Vance is plainly ambivalent about the invasion.",
    "Which really gets to the rub of the matter.",
    "Let’s hope so.",
    "Vance."
