    "“He has talked about [Mandel] and sex in the same sentence more times than I would have liked to hear.”\nThe other two sources, both of whom requested anonymity in order to talk about private discussions, corroborated accounts of the ex-president’s newly acquired interest in the alleged details of Mandel’s sex life or personal ongoings.",
    "One reason for the hold-up is that Trump—who has long been addicted to dishing tabloid-style gossip and dirt—has for months told people close to him that he thinks Mandel is a charisma-free weirdo and dork, according to three sources who’ve spoken to Trump about Mandel and the Ohio contest since last year.",
    "It is ironic that someone like Donald Trump, who has been accused of all kinds of sexual misconduct, would care to gossip so much about these matters, but… that’s just who he is.”\nOn Friday, the Mandel campaign declined to comment, and a Trump spokesman did not provide comment for this story, either.",

    "Starting at the very dawn of the Biden presidency, a slate of increasingly MAGA-fied Republican candidates have each competed for Donald Trump’s coveted endorsement in the critical, Hunger Games-esque U.S. Senate primary in Ohio.",
    "In recent months, these sources said, the onetime leader of the free world has even spent an inordinate amount of time gossiping with a large array of advisers and close associates about unconfirmed details of Mandel’s sex life.",
    "Five contenders have already spent roughly $30 million of their own money on their campaigns, according to The Columbus Dispatch, a fact that is already making the contest one of the most expensive of the 2022 cycle.",
    "The meeting underscored what right-wing candidates in various 2022 races across the country are willing to do to directly appeal to the famously ego-driven Trump—and how much they would obsequiously audition for him.",
    "“When I worked for him in the White House, he had no problem bringing up or asking about supposed details of the personal lives of prominent politicians or other famous people, even his own staff.",

    "Former Ohio GOP chairwoman Jane Timken has received the support of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) as well as South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, according to her campaign website.",
    "One, conducted by the Trafalgar Group in December, had Mandel leading the pack of contenders with 21 percent, with Vance, his nearest competitor, trailing 6 points behind.",
    "Those sources relayed that Trump had also told them some combination of the following:\nMandel doesn’t have the right “visuals” or “look,” and could come off poorly on TV.",
    "Also, the former president and current leader of the Republican Party has sensed a conspicuous dearth of “charisma” coming from this particular GOP Senate hopeful.",
    "In March of last year, Politico reported on the “secret sit-down” in Florida that Trump convened with four of the Trump-adulating Ohio candidates—including Mandel.",

    "Trump has privately regurgitated, often in disgust, a wide range of unverified, often completely unvetted, and lurid rumors about the MAGA candidate.",
    "Having met with and talked to Mandel, Trump felt there was just something about Mandel and his personality that rubbed him the wrong way.",
    "“What ensued was a 15-minute backroom backbiting session reminiscent of Trump’s reality TV show [The Apprentice],” the report said.",
