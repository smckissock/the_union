    "Vance (@JDVance1) February 19, 2022\nVance’s response to the general drew a great deal of pickup on social media — where plenty of reactors reminded him of McCaffrey’s record in service to the country:\nBarry McCaffrey has two Distinguished Service Crosses, two Silver Stars and three Purple Hearts, you seditious fobbit https://t.co/fb1ufoviea\n— Brandon Friedman (@BFriedmanDC) February 20, 2022\nDid commanding the 24th infantry division during the first Gulf War not count as serving in military leadership?",
    "pic.twitter.com/7adjQnMluL\n— John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) February 20, 2022\nHe’s talking about a guy with three Purple Hearts, two silver stars, and who commanded 24th ID in Desert Storm, leading the attack that led to one of the most decisive military victories in American history.",
    "Vance recently appeared on Steve Bannon‘s War Room Pandemic podcast and said “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.” He proceeded to slam President Joe Biden for focusing on defending Ukraine from Russia more than securing America’s southern border.",
    "(@cmclymer) February 19, 2022\nMr Vance is apparently unaware of @mccaffreyr3’s record as commander of the 24th Infantry Division during Desert Storm or his three Purple Hearts, two Distinguished Service Crosses, and two Silver / four Bronze Stars.",
    "As Vance’s remarks circulated through the media, McCaffrey called him a “shameful person unsuitable for public office,” saying he’s acting like a “stooge for Russian aggression” with his disregard over Russia’s threat to a Democratic U.S. ally.",
    "— Barry R McCaffrey (@mccaffreyr3) February 20, 2022\nWhile the former general kept his personal response largely straight-faced, he did engage with several other people who weren’t as nice in responding to Vance:\nOne son….",
    "https://t.co/JEhHA3P7Av\n— Andrew Feinberg (@AndrewFeinberg) February 20, 2022\nMcCaffrey eventually took notice of Vance’s insult himself, and completely dunked on the Ohio senate candidate:\nWell.",
    "“I’m sick of Joe Biden focusing on the border of a country I don’t care about while he lets the border of his own country become a total war zone,” Vance said.",
    "— Barry R McCaffrey (@mccaffreyr3) February 19, 2022\nVance took strong exception to that criticism:\nYour entire time in military leadership we won zero wars.",
    "Republican U.S. Senate candidate JD Vance has been torn apart for insulting the military record of retired four star U.S. Army general, Barry McCaffrey.",
    "You drank fine wine at bullshit security conferences while thousands of working class kids died on the battlefield.",
    "https://t.co/NpEGcMWpjj\n— David French (@DavidAFrench) February 20, 2022\nHe led the 24th ID in the Gulf War.",
    "Oh, by the way, how much do you stand to gain financially from a war with Russia, Barry?",
    "— Barry R McCaffrey (@mccaffreyr3) February 20, 2022\nA way with words.",
    "— Barry R McCaffrey (@mccaffreyr3) February 20, 2022\nTough terrain.",
    "This is such a sad and shameful attack on an honorable man.",
    "JD Vance is a shameful person unsuitable for public office.",
    "His comments are those of a stooge for Russian aggression.",
    "— Barry R McCaffrey (@mccaffreyr3) February 20, 2022",
    "Two of those kids who served were my children.",
    "Two more are now serving … grandsons.",
    "That was him, you traitorous dipshit.",
    "The famous “left hook” attack?",
    "https://t.co/BSOIhWWkdF\n— J.D.",
    "— Charlotte Clymer ??????",
    "I don’t drink wine.",
    "Thanks for serving.",
    "Water thirst.",
    "one daughter!",
    "80 lbs.",
    "And…."
