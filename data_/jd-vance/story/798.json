    "While nearly every candidate running for Senate proclaims themselves to be \"America First,\" Vance stands out from the pack because of his genuine populist convictions on issues like immigration, trade, breaking up Big Tech and ending endless wars.",
    "Vance opposes amnesty, wants to finish the wall, will end welfare for illegal immigrants, believes we should declare the Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations and will cut federal funding to any city or state that allows illegals to vote.",
    "While most weak RINOs crumble the moment the media falsely accuses them of being \"racist,\" Vance has explicitly rejected their smears and made clear that no matter what names they decide to call him, that he will always put America First.",
    "While two of his primary opponents, Josh Mandel and Mike Gibbons, enthusiastically endorsed a \"European led\" no-fly-zone in Ukraine, Vance has courageously opposed further escalation and a potential World War III with Russia.",
    "My father is right: \"It is time for the entire MAGA movement, the greatest in the history of our country, to unite behind J.D.’s campaign because, unlike so many other pretenders and wannabes, he will put America First.\"",
    "On the issue of ending stupid trade agreements that have destroyed our industrial base, no candidate in this race, and perhaps no candidate running across the country, is more aligned with President Trump than Vance.",
    "America First voters didn’t elect these Republicans to go to Washington to just spout talking points, they were elected to actually push back against the radical left and advance our conservative principles.",
    "Vance has earned the support of the strongest America First voices in the nation, including President Trump, Tucker Carlson, Ric Grenell, Charlie Kirk, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Josh Hawley and many others.",
    "One thing my father and I are both sick of is two-faced Republicans who talk a good game on TV and repeat the right slogans, but then turnaround and sell out our America First agenda to the swamp.",
    "The other Republicans in this race have more in common with Bill Kristol and Liz Cheney’s foreign policy, than the America First foreign policy of my father.",
    "While other Republicans repeat talking points about stopping Big Tech censorship, too few of them are willing to actually do anything about it.",
    "Just like my father, Vance understands that American foreign policy should be guided by American national interests and nothing else.",
    "Vance has consistently opposed these stupid wars and instead called on our leaders to focus on the problems we have here at home.",
    "He won’t just hit the media circuit complaining about illegal immigration, he’ll actually fight like hell to secure the border.",
    "That’s not surprising though, because the RINOs and establishment insiders are never happy with outsiders who shake things up.",
    "Unlike others, Vance understands that the time for talk is over and Republicans need to actually hold Big Tech accountable.",
    "Finally, there’s the issue of standing against the endless wars constantly being pushed by the Washington establishment.",
    "Most importantly, Vance won’t back down just because the Democrats and the left-wing media call him bad names.",
    "He’s the only candidate in the race calling to break up Big Tech to finally end their censorship regime.",
    "And that’s exactly why President Trump and I are both strongly supporting Vance for Senate here in Ohio.",
    "Just like my father, he understands the importance of using tariffs to hold China accountable.",
    "That’s why it’s so vital that in 2022 we elect America First warriors across the country.",
    "And then there’s the issue of ending Big Tech’s censorship of conservative voices.",
    "That’s the type of courage we could use more of in the United States Senate.",
    "Sadly, too few of them have the strength to do what they were elected to do.",
    "Donald Trump Jr. is executive vice president at The Trump Organization.",
    "For the Buckeye State and the future of our entire movement.",
    "Vance sent MAGA waves through the Republican establishment.",
    "Opinion contributor\nMy father’s decision to endorse J.D.",
    "All of this is why J.D.",
    "So let’s win this Ohio!",
    "They are not happy."
