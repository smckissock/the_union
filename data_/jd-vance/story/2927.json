    "While Trump has driven GOP political messaging on a host of issues for years, the former President has found himself out of step with the vast majority of Republican voters on the Russia question.",
    "Several GOP candidates in key races have expressed similar sentiments about Putin and the Russian invasion, though many also criticize the Biden administration's response as ineffective.",
    "But amid Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, the relatively few Republican candidates who have aligned themselves with Trump's posture have found themselves on a political island.",
    "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, looking to lead the GOP to a majority this November, told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday that he disagreed with Trump's Putin assessment.",
    "(CNN)North Carolina Senate candidate Pat McCrory is going after his top rival in the Republican primary, accusing him of being \"friendly\" toward Russia and Vladimir Putin.",
    "\"Talking and acting tough on Russia and foreign policy crises have been terra firma for Republicans for generations,\" said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist.",
    "I think Putin is evil, I think he's a dictator, and I think he's murdering people right now,\" McCarthy said, without mentioning the former President by name.",
    "The overwhelming opposition to Putin across the political spectrum has not been lost on Republican leaders with an eye to the midterm elections.",
    "Republican leaders in Washington, from the anti-Trump Rep. Liz Cheney to populists like Sen. Josh Hawley, have been sharply critical of Putin.",
    "Interspersed in McCrory's voiceover are two separate remarks from Budd just days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in late February.",

    "Some conservative allies of Trump in the media embraced Putin as an opponent of the decadence and political priorities of Western elites.",
    "In one clip from Fox News, Budd assesses that Putin had \"strategic reasons\" for wanting to \"protect his southern and western flank.\"",

    "And when asked last week about Trump's comments on Russia, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell called Putin a \"ruthless thug.\"",
    "Among Republicans, 81% had an unfavorable view of Putin -- including 59% who said they had a strongly unfavorable opinion.",
    "As part of his approach, the former President repeatedly praised Putin, while criticizing the NATO alliance as \"obsolete.\"",
    "In the minds of GOP primary voters, Putin's invasion has clarified things, says Republican pollster Glen Bolger.",
    "In another, during an interview with a local TV station, Budd calls Putin a \"very intelligent actor.\"",
    "Vance said in a podcast interview he didn't \"really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\"",
    "\"These are serious times and we need serious senators,\" McCrory says in the ad.",
    "In the ad, McCrory also criticizes Budd for voting against sanctions on Russia.",
