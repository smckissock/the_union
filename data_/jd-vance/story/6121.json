    "Fourteen of the top GOP consultants and operatives describe how the Republican Party has moved away from the Chamber of Commerce, the Koch brothers' network of donor class organizations, National Review, and economic libertarian groups toward Trump's small-dollar donors, populist-nationalist outlets like Breitbart News, and Tucker Carlson.",
    "Whereas Republicans once competed for campaign cash from the Kochs, significant backers of mass immigration and job-killing free trade, candidates attempt to steer clear of the network while running against open borders and in support of industrial policy to restore America's manufacturing base.",
    "These days, it is Trump's voters, Breitbart News readers, and Carlson witnesses that Republicans hope to win over in elections instead of seeking out corporate campaign contributions through endorsements from the Heritage Foundation,\nFreedomWorks, and the Senate Conservatives Fund.",
    "\"We all owe Donald Trump a great deal for single-handedly destroying the corrupt globalist and corporatist\northodoxies that previously defined the Republican Party, in favor of a new Republican Party, that is pro-worker and always puts America first,\" Vance told Breitbart News.",
    "Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Todd Young (R-IN), John Thune (R-SD), and Mike Lee (R-UT), as well as to Reps. Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Maria Salazar (R-FL), and Don Bacon (R-NE), among others.",
    "Vance, the New York Times best-selling author now running for Senate in Ohio, announced the party's change comes as beltway conservative orthodoxy has been broken through by the likes of Trump, Breitbart News, and Carlson.",
    "That shift attempts to increasingly align Republican lawmakers and those running for office with the nation's largest voting bloc: economic populists who are socially Conservative.",
    "Most recently, the Chamber pressed President Joe Biden and Congress to double legal immigration levels and provide amnesty to the country's 11 to 22 million illegal migrants.",
    "\"If the U.S. Chamber of Commerce calls you and says 'We want to endorse,' You're like, 'Please don't,'\" a high-profile GOP political consultant told Axios.",
    "The Republican Party's links to the Chamber, while financially still tied, have shrunk dramatically in recent election years.",
    "\"â€¦ none of the operatives we interviewed considered Koch support to be important in 2022,\" the Axios report notes.",
    "Last year, the Chamber's Political Action Committee (PAC) donated thousands to Sens.",
    "February 8, 2022\n\"You don't want Breitbart on your ass,\" a GOP operative told Axios.",
    "The same goes for the Koch network.",
    "J.D."
