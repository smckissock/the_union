    "Mandel answered claiming “I wasn’t making a display, I was standing up for military men and women throughout our country.” Mandel went on to claim that Mike Gibbons, one of his opponents in the Ohio GOP senate primary, attacked U.S. military personnel as not having a “real job” and then tied Gibbons to China and Hunter Biden.",
    "“Gibbons is an old Irishman and so there would have been a couple blows thrown,” Bannon added, saying, “You’re known as a fighter, even the people that don’t like you know you as a fight.”\n“Why make a big display of it?” Bannon asked.",
    "Because you weren’t backing down and he wasn’t backing down,” Bannon noted of the confrontation in which Mandel called Gibbons a “pussy” as the two candidates physically faced each other down on stage.",
    "Vance, maybe you two guys would have gone at it,” Bannon started off on Monday’s episode of his War Room podcast, asking Mandel about the bombastic debate that made headlines across the country.",

    "“What was it that hit the tripwire that you had to stand up to a 70-year-old guy and basically throw down right there if it hadn’t been for the moderator, maybe J.D.",
    "“When you say there’s no personal animosity, if you had not been separated, don’t you believe that you two guys would have come to blows?” Bannon asked smiling.",
    "Would you commit to not having these things throw down to some type of physical confrontation?” Bannon asked as his program was having technical difficulties.",
    "Say, you made this money but to tone down the personal animosity so that people can actually hear these debates and hear what people have to say.",

    "“Being an Irishman and being in enough bars in my life, it looked like it was about to be — it was a throwdown.",
