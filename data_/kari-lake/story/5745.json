    "What the fuck kind of world do we live in… pic.twitter.com/CsNnm9x6iL\n— Mr. Red White and Blue (@Sharkguy726) February 9, 2022\n— Catturd ™ (@catturd2) February 10, 2022\nBiden’s DHS Brands Free Speech ‘Terrorism Threat’ to U.S. — ‘Welcome to Your Communist Future’\nAny proliferating “narratives” the Biden administration deems “false or misleading” qualifies as a “terrorism threat” according to a recent National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin released by the Biden administration’s DHS, and has received sharp backlash online after warning that Americans are expressing unwelcome beliefs on issues such as the Chinese coronavirus and election fraud pose “an ongoing threat to the nation.”\nThe bulletin, issued on Monday by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), addressed the “Terrorism Threat to the U.S. Homeland.”\nIn it, the country is described as being in a “heightened threat environment” due to factors such as online content featuring “false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, and other forms of mis- dis- and mal-information (MDM) introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors.”\nThe “threat actors” are accused of seeking to “exacerbate societal friction to sow discord and undermine public trust in government institutions to encourage unrest,” which could potentially lead to acts of violence.",
    "In addition, it claims the recent resettlement of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August may be used to “exacerbate long-standing grievances and justify attacks against immigrants.”\nAs a result, DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are “sharing information and intelligence with our partners across every level of government and in the private sector” to combat the aforementioned threats.",
    "COVID measures such as vaccine and mask mandates are stated to “have been used by domestic violent extremists to justify violence since 2020” and can potentially continue to inspire them “to target government, healthcare, and academic institutions that they associate with those measures.”\nThe introduction of 5G cellular technology, too, has been subject to “false or misleading narratives,” according to the bulletin.",
    "Citizens are also warned of “[m]ass casualty attacks and other acts of targeted violence” by those “acting in furtherance of ideological beliefs and/or personal grievances.”\nThe bulletin also designates individuals and small cells “motivated by a range of foreign and/or domestic grievances often cultivated through the consumption of certain online content” as the “primary terrorism-related threat” to the country.",
    "The Washington Post published a piece the same day declaring that the “antidemocracy” GOP “stands for insurrection and authoritarianism” and poses a “dire danger to U.S. democracy — and to the lives of ordinary Americans.”\nLast month, the New York Times published a piece claiming the U.S. may be on the verge of collapse due to right-wing threats on democracy.",
    "@DHSgov is out of control… https://t.co/HfTuAskryd\n— Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) February 9, 2022\n“Another Biden agency proves itself a civil liberties menace,” he added in another tweet..\n“New DHS bulletin says those opposed to COVID Mania are terrorists,” wrote investigative journalist Jordan Schachtel.",
    "https://t.co/6JuaNrXtbG\n— Kari Lake for AZ Governor (@KariLake) February 8, 2022\nThe recent directives come as the Justice Department is establishing its own “domestic terrorism” unit, and the left continues to routinely describe Republicans and their supporters as a domestic threat to democracy.",

    "The bulletin recommends that citizens report any “potential threats” and keep safe online by maintaining the “digital and media literacy” needed to “recognize and build resilience to false or misleading narratives.”\nIn response, the DHS publication drew sharp backlash online.",
