    "Before answering on that topic, Lake called Bartlett out for his disrespectful and flippant attitude, referring to his use of the expression, “your man Donald,” before pointing out, “It’s obvious that you come into this interview and you don’t like President Donald Trump.”\nWhen Bartlett repeated his question as to whether a pardon should be issued, Lake made clear she has no say in that now, nor would she if elected governor, before accusing Bartlett of “trying to twist [the] interview” and trying to make her look bad.",
    "https://t.co/CJqqSWTaD8\n— Kari Lake for AZ Governor (@KariLake) March 9, 2022\nLake lays out hard facts on violence that took place in America, discussing the firebombing of buildings, chaos from Antifa and the destruction of churches, businesses and peoples’ livelihoods under the Democratic headline of “peaceful protesting.”\nShe further went on to clarify that there is no justification for violence in the name of any cause.",
    "“Maybe they get away with that stuff in Australia…because you’ve given your rights away, you’ve melted down all of your guns, and you guys have no freedom, that you find that OK.”\nLake reinforced the importance of the U.S. Constitution as she voiced her pity for the people in Australia who have “no power” before expressing the only thing keeping America from a similar fate is the Second Amendment.",
    "(Video: CBS News)\nArizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake walked out on a “60 Minutes Australia” interview, calling the host “insane” and accusing him of “pushing propaganda.”\nLake, a former anchor for Fox News’ Phoenix affiliate KSAZ, sat down with Liam Bartlett in February to discuss her campaign for governor.",
    "Bartlett then insulted Lake by saying, “So when the going gets tough, the tough get going.”\nA discussion ensued where Bartlett accused Lake of cutting the interview by half of the agreed-upon amount even though, at the onset, they agree to 15 minutes.",
    "You shouldn’t be telling me how to see the world.”\nLake continued on, expressing her pity for Bartlett and the people of Australia as being brainwashed by outlets like his who pushed fear throughout the pandemic.",
    "In the selected clip that recently went viral in the lead-up to the airing of the interview, Bartlett repeatedly calls Trump, “your man Donald” because of the official endorsement of Lake’s campaign.",
    "However, the interview ended up being entirely focused on former President Donald Trump along with perceptions of the 2020 election and January 6, 2021.",
    "Seriously, a complete insane person.”\nShe was more than happy to share the entire, unedited version of the interview and there are stark contrasts.",
    "He then went on to ask Lake if she agreed with Trump that the Americans being held due to their connections to January 6 should be pardoned.",
    "She went on to highlight the severe lockdown of Australians throughout COVID including the quarantine camps that citizens were forced into.",
    "Lake also sat through the question that she said would be the last one, unlike the clip that shows her rise almost immediately to leave.",
    "It’s worth taking a look at the promotional advertisement for the interview, which is also a stunning display of propaganda.",
    "She could be seen getting out of her chair and heard saying to someone else in the room, “That guy is a complete nut.",
    "pic.twitter.com/OutOJNT8L7\n— Kari Lake for AZ Governor (@KariLake) March 9, 2022\nPLEASE JOIN OUR NEW COMMENT SYSTEM!",
    "@LiamBartlett9 and the rest of the Fake News “journalists” are nothing but propagandists lying to the people.",
    "It’s frightening and if you can’t see that, I feel sorry for you.”\nLake then declared the interview was over.",
    "They finally decided to use the footage and the trailer looks like an action-adventure film for our campaign!",
    "She then slammed Bartlett for trying to push his view of the world on her, “You’re a journalist, sir.",
    "We love hearing from our readers and invite you to join us for feedback and great conversation.",
    "She then thanked him again for his time, called him a nut and thanked the crew for their time.",
    "When she did get up to go, she thanked the representatives for “60 Minutes” who hosted her.",
    "If you've commented with us before, we'll need you to re-input your email address for this.",
    "Lake said that was “the most horrifying thing I think I have ever seen a government do.",
    "“What I don’t like is that people are being held in prison without being charged.",
    "Australia interview with that hack of a “journalist” @LiamBartlett9?",
    "That’s un-American,” Lake declared before going on the offensive.",
    "The public will not see it and we do not share it.",
    "Here’s the entire interview.",
    "You have to watch this ????",
