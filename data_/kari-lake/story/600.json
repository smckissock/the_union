    "This included missing audit signatures, missing ballot count fields, missing Election Department receiver signatures, missing courier signatures and missing documentation of security seals and lack of the two required seal numbers….it is possible that somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 ballots were transported without a proper chain of custody.”\nTrump’s statement on Monday faulted Brnovich for enumerating such findings “but, rather than go after the people that committed these election crimes, it looks like he is just going to ‘kick the can down the road’ and stay in that middle path of non-controversy.”\n“What a shame for the Great State of Arizona, and for our Country itself!” Trump ruminated, assigning blame for the current state of the nation and world to the election results.",
    "In his 12-page April 6 “interim” report to Fann, Brnovich stated that his office found “serious vulnerabilities that must be addressed and raises questions about the 2020 election in Arizona.”\nThose conclusions appear to contradict mainstream news reports claiming Brnovich uncovered “no evidence of mass fraud in Maricopa County 2020 election results.”\nAlthough Brnovich reported that chain-of-custody procedures were violated, including by Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D), Arizona Republic reported, “Attorney general’s report on election in Maricopa County questions procedures, doesn’t allege wrongdoing.”\n“Our review uncovered multiple violations of ballot transportation procedures,” Brnovich wrote on page 7.",

    "In late September, Trump appeared to view Brnovich favorably in light of the results of the audit, telling supporters at a Georgia rally, “Hopefully the Arizona attorney general, a good man, will do far more for his state than your attorney general has done for your state because your attorney general has not done what he’s supposed to be doing.",
    "We must elect strong, brave America first leaders who will be true champions for the people and for free, fair and honest elections.”\nIn March 2021, Brnovich’s office defended two election-related laws passed by the Arizona legislature at the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld both, reversing a ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
