    "And you wonder why Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, and others are so keen to burn math textbooks...\nArizona's Republican Congresswoman Debbie Lesko said on Twitter that Border Patrol agents had arrested a billion people at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past six months—wrongly adding three zeros to the correct number of a million people.",
    "Citing a piece from the Wall Street Journal (which clearly states in its headline that one million people were arrested at the southern border), Lesko mentions the arrests as a clear sign that \"President Biden's open border policies are fueling this crisis!,\" although she does so by quoting a made-up number of apprehended migrants.",
    "https://t.co/UZ2lnlcxNT\n— Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) April 20, 2022\nPut aside the ridiculous number, if they were apprehended at the border then it’s NOT OPEN, is it?",
    "1/8th of the planet’s population went to the Southern Border this year?",
    "And her tweet, which surprisingly, as of this writing, remains up.",
    "I guess Debbie woke up to find herself called an idiot.",
    "Debbie, do you want to delete this tweet or you good?",
    "The House GOP caucus is full of them.",
    "And we apprehended all of them?",
    "Twitter was quick to pounce.",
    "(edit: And poof, it's gone.",
    "https://t.co/MReZk5dUa3",
    "Holy shit!",
    "Geniuses.",
    "Again.)"
