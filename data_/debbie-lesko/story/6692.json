    "The threat to take back the funding and withhold the next tranche of funds exceeds the statutory authority granted to the Treasury by Congress, lawyers for Ducey’s office said in the filing, which was lodged in federal district court in Arizona.",

    "“The Biden administration is attempting to hold Congressionally-appropriated funds hostage and is trying to bully Arizona into complying with this power-grabbing move,” Ducey said during an appearance on Fox News.",
    "By Zachary Stieber of the Epoch Times\nArizona’s governor on Friday sued President Joe Biden’s administration, asserting its attempt to take back federal money from certain states was not authorized by Congress.",
    "The U.S. Treasury Department recently threatened to wrest the funds from Arizona because state officials have made distribution of the money contingent on not requiring masks.",
    "Failure to change the rules may result in the Treasury moving to recoup the funds and withhold future funds, an official said in a letter to Ducey’s office last week.",
    "The suit came after four members of Congress representing Arizona urged Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to rescind her department’s threat.",
    "The creation of two grant programs to distribute the money follows the text of the act, the governor asserts.",
    "The court was asked to declare the final rule invalid and enjoin its planned actions."
