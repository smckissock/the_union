    "In an interview with the Washington Monthly, the Iraq and Afghanistan War veteran said the committee’s findings could galvanize bipartisan support for reforming the Electoral Count Act, closing the loopholes that Trumpists wanted to exploit to overturn the 2020 election, and hurt Republicans in this year’s midterm elections who have cemented their cult-like allegiance to the disgraced former president.",
    "Kinzinger told me he supports most of what President Joe Biden has done to unite NATO allies, beef up Ukraine’s security, and impose crippling economic sanctions on Russia—although he said he would have started imposing sanctions sooner and would not have signaled to Russian President Vladimir Putin so clearly, as Biden did, that U.S. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine.",

    "This isn’t based on any special knowledge, because the DOJ is very cautious about even communicating with the Select Committee, but I do have a sense they’re building a broader case.",
    "And the members of Congress who all think about their legacy, you may feel good about your legacy at this moment, but trust me, in five or 10 years, you’re going to be ashamed.",
    "If we can have full accountability, if we can implement changes, and inform people of things like misinformation, how conspiracies spread, we can come back from that bad day.",
    "And I think that’s his biggest fear—of what will come if Ukraine succeeds in turning westward or if Georgia succeeds in building a close relationship with the United States.",
    "If GOP candidates are trying to out-Trump each other in these primaries to be more like him, would that hurt them with moderate voters in the general election?",
    "The question is whether they can get through the primaries, but I think those stances can be certainly beneficial for those candidates in general elections.",
    "Like most hawks, Kinzinger, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, believes that diplomacy works best when backed by a credible threat of force.",
    "I do think it could have a pretty significant impact on 2024, because accepting the Big Lie as a presidential candidate may be seen as far less cool to do.",

    "I think when we look back at 9/11, and we have a conversation about what went wrong, the 9/11 Commission report is usually referenced.",
    "Do you think your committee report will be the record that will go down as the historical record and be accepted by enough Americans?",

    "Biden did put more troops on the front lines of those eastern European NATO countries and gave security assistance to the Ukrainians.",
    "Do you think the panel’s findings will galvanize interest on the part of Republicans and Democrats to reform America’s voting laws?",

    "And I think we are on track to have the most comprehensive story of that day that I’ve seen yet.",
    "I’m more of the belief that diplomacy with an adversary works when it’s backed by real threats.",
