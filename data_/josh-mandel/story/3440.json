    "#ampFW pic.twitter.com/9GNGeouewX\n— Peter Vicenzi (@PeterVicenzi) March 18, 2022\nJD Vance who was also part of the event got up and told Mandel to sit down saying “This is ridiculous.” He went on to criticize Mandel for his references to his own military service.",
    "Finally, some speculation about why this might be happening:\nMandel, who had been the front runner in Ohio GOP Senate race, is clearly worried about recent polling showing Gibbons ahead and reports that Trump will meet with Gibbons.",
    "Things went downhill from there and a moderator came over like he was the referee at a fight:\nMike Gibbons and Josh Mandel get in each other’s faces at tonight’s GOP #OHSen forum hosted by FreedomWorks.",
    "https://t.co/RRoqg2it1q\n— Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) March 19, 2022\nAnyway, not a great look but it’s noteworthy that everyone else at the event was pretty clear about their disapproval of it.",
    "Stop playing around.”\nGibbons was quick to capitalize on the spat, calling Mandel “unhinged, unfit, and flailing.”\nJosh Mandel is unhinged, unfit, and flailing – because he’s losing.",
    "#OHSen pic.twitter.com/xLgdca7gxR\n— Mike Gibbons (@MikeGibbonsOH) March 18, 2022\nStill no comment from Mandel that I can see but it has only been a couple of hours.",
    "… This guy wants to be a U.S. senator, and he’s up here [saying], ‘Hold me back, I got two tours in the Marine Corps.’ What a joke.",
    "— Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) March 18, 2022\nWell, everyone watched what happened and no one liked it.",
    "I wonder if that will get mentioned in any of the major media writes up that mention it tomorrow morning?",
    "We need an adult in the room and Josh Mandel has proven that he is not capable of being that for Ohioans.",
    "More video of the @FreedomWorks Ohio senate forum exchange between Mike Gibbons and Josh Mandel.",
    "Here’s another angle where you can really hear the booing from the crowd at this display.",
    "Josh Mandel accused Mike Gibbons of making “millions” off business deals in China.",
    "The event was a Republican Senate primary debate put on by Freedom Works.",
    "“It’s not a political football for you to toss around,” Vance said.",
    "Gibbons disagreed saying he wished that were true.",
    "We can’t leave this race to child-like candidates.",
    "And then Mandel got up and got in Gibbons’ face.",
    "“Think about what we just saw.",
    "Answer the question."
