    "The conservative firm Public Opinion Strategies included questions about the Florida law in its rolling national poll, giving voters a summary of the law: “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in Kindergarten through third grade or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”\nWhen it's put like that, 61 percent of voters approved of the legislation, including a majority of Democrats and people who voted for President Biden in 2020.",
    "Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said in an email that voters would get to choose “between their Congresswoman who loves them and delivered hundreds of millions of dollars to St. Louis, and a host of ego-driven men who seem to think all that Black women leaders do is never good enough.” He pointed to allegations made against Roberts by fellow lawmaker Cora Faith Walker, who died 20 days ago, to add that the senator had been “credibly accused of rape.” (The candidate didn't respond to a question from The Trailer but earlier denied he had raped Walker.)",
    "The “one word” of the title, and the first word from Ryan's mouth, is “China,” and the ad plays a few overlapping clips of the candidate telling voters that America must defeat “Communist China” economically by “investing in Ohio workers.” That's not a new message for Ohio Democrats, but the state chapter of Asian American Midwest Progressives quickly condemned it, urging Ryan to “pull the One Word ad and eliminate all inflated anti-Asian messaging from his campaign.” He didn't pull the ad.",
    "Just 8 percent of registered voters said “yes” to the first question, and by a 36-point margin, most said people should “only be allowed to play on sports teams that match their birth gender.”\nThe numbers reminded POS pollster Robert Blizzard of the discourse around Georgia's 2021 voting law, which led to several corporate boycotts of the state, endorsed by Democrats, but which ended up being supported by most voters once Republicans sold it as an anti-fraud measure.",
    "“The new congressional plan has the effect of denying Black voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.”\nIn Missouri, the candidate filing deadline came and went this week while legislators in Jefferson City rejected the new congressional map — maintaining a 6-to-2 GOP advantage, and shoring up one Republican seat — in favor of further negotiations.",
    "An internal poll shared by the Edwards campaign put Cawthorn well ahead of the field, but that was before he told the conservative podcast “Warrior Poet Society” that the real Washington was just as corrupt as the one in “House of Cards.”\nThe 26-year old congressman had offered up fish stories before, telling one crowd in the district that he’d confirmed “rumors of alcoholism” about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who does not drink.",

    "Dan Conston, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund — the GOP's PAC counterpart — said in an interview that the House Majority PAC's reservations were “a recognition that Democrats have already lost the House” and have “traditionally blue districts in real peril.” New York State Assemblyman Colin Schmitt (R), a 31-year old National Guard member, is running against Maloney on that theory.",
    "“I'm a patriot who literally answered the call when Congressman Cawthorn left this district for Charlotte and asked me to step in and run.”\nHalfway into his first term, Cawthorn is one of several high-profile, anti-establishment members of Congress from both parties who won upset victories to get there — and now face primary challengers who want them gone.",

Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) told a podcaster that he’d been invited to orgies and watched colleagues snort cocaine, and a few days before the House minority leader admonished him for saying that, the youngest Republican in Congress shared a stage with the people who want to replace him.",

    "Before the 2016 and 2020 elections — i.e., before pollsters realized that Trump's support was underestimated — the idea that nearly any Democrat could beat Trump was rampant among party activists, and polling that showed Biden leading Trump by landslide margins helped power him to the nomination.",
    "This ad uses Gibbons's quote — “Josh doesn't understand this, because he's never spent a day in the private sector” — but puts text on-screen saying that Gibbons was insulting veterans, and has Marine veteran Brian Sizer, who served with Mandel, calling it “disgraceful” and demanding an apology.",

    "That surprised some Republicans, and Democrats, who see several New York seats as potentially vulnerable, including the 18th Congressional District that Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Sean Patrick Maloney has represented for nine years.",
