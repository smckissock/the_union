    "If you spent any time on Twitter as the work week drew to a close, you probably saw The Discourse about an unsigned Times editorial titled “America Has a Free Speech Problem.” Much of the chatter was disdainful about the piece’s lede, which proclaimed that “Americans are losing hold of a fundamental right as citizens of a free country: the right to speak their minds and voice their opinions in public without fear of being shamed or shunned.”\nPuck’s Dylan Byers has a worthwhile look at the context for the editorial, both inside the paper and within the broader media.",
