    "Advertisement\nLast week, Cawthorn responded to a question from the host of “Warrior Poet Society” about how his experience in the nation’s capital compared to the degeneracy seen on “House of Cards” by launching into a discussion on “the sexual perversion that goes on in Washington.”\nHe claimed that certain unnamed officials had invited him to sex parties and taken cocaine “key bumps” in his presence.",
    "Cawthorn, whose hometown newspaper once called him “North Carolina’s gift to Crazytown,” has made a number of inaccurate or ill-advised claims in the past, including calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) an alcoholic, calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug,” and calling former President Donald Trump a father figure.",

    "“Then all of a sudden, you get invited to, ‘Oh, hey, we’re going to have a sexual get-together at one of our homes, you should come.’”\n“Then you realized they’re asking you to come to an orgy,” he said.",
    "Freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) found out the hard way what sort of vile and divisive rhetoric the Republican Party absolutely will not tolerate: talking about crazy Washington parties.",
    "According to McCarthy, Cawthorn admitted in the meeting that his claims were “exaggerated” and that, at worst, he might have seen a staffer take cocaine in a parking garage from a distance.",
    "House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) previously told Politico he also plans to speak with Cawthorn on the matter, adding that he might ask the lawmaker to name names.",
    "Another GOP senator, Mike Braun of Indiana, recently said the question of whether people of different races should be able to marry is best decided on a state-by-state basis.",
    "“I look at a lot of these people, a lot of them that I’ve looked up to through my life - I’ve always paid attention to politics,” Cawthorn said in the episode.",

    "It affects everybody else, and the country as a whole,” the House minority leader told Politico reporter Olivia Beavers.",
    "But Cawthorn’s offense appears to have disturbed Republican leadership on a different level.",
    "Advertisement\n“I just told him he’s lost my trust [and] he’s gonna have to earn it back.",
    "Gosar appeared at the same conference last year."
