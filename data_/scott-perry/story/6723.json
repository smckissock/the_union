    "Joe Douglas-Robert Saleh, Jets\nStill very much in a wait-and-see approach here, but if there are three things that have to make Jets fans optimistic even after 4-13, it’s these: 1) They were far more competitive at the end of the year than at the start; 2) Zach Wilson was playing better in December and January than in September; 3) The GM and coach appear to be in lockstep and they had a good first draft together last year.",
    "Leon Rose-Tom Thibodeau, Knicks\nYou don’t get the sense that these two are spending much time together on the social circuit, and it sometimes seems as if Thibodeau is biting his tongue when talking about some players who aren’t exactly what you would call “Thibs Players.” But the fact is, the Knicks are watchable again after two full decades of being almost unbearable.",
    "Lou Lamoriello-Barry Trotz, Islanders\nOK, yes, you look at the Metropolitan Division standings and you see the Islanders dead last, as they’ve been for much of the year, and they have an awful lot of catching up to do to get within shouting distance of the playoffs.",
    "Vac’s Whacks\nIt is possible that when we look back at this era of the Nets, we’re going to wonder how differently things might have gone if they’d hired an established coach and not one who seems to still be constantly learning on the job, the way Steve Nash is.",
    "Brian Cashman-Aaron Boone, Yankees\nHere’s where the pitchforks will surely come out, especially after a 2021 season in which hardly any Yankees fan seemed happy at what was happening, and the start of a mostly dormant 2022 offseason.",
    "Whack Back at Vac\nRich Lilling: While I agree David Wright’s number should be retired at some point, I respectfully think that Gary Carter should probably go first (ultimately, it doesn’t matter so long as they’re both honored).",
    "But it’s pretty clear that once the shock of last year’s purge wore off, what has resulted is a team that is pleasing to watch almost every night and has little problem going nose-to-nose with the league’s best.",
    "Billy Eppler-Buck Showalter, Mets\nIf we were to do this list a year from now — assuming there are baseball games played between now and then — I suspect this twosome would be in the upper half of the list.",
    "Well, the Giants have decided to line up their new general manager and their new coach, and though we have neither person’s identity yet, we know this: They will begin their tenure here on the same page.",
    "So maybe it’s time for a snapshot at the other eight coach-GM pairings in town: where they rate so far on being copacetic as work partners and also in the success their teams have had.",
    "Tom Fitzgerald-Lindy Ruff, Devils\nThere have been flashes of hope in Newark, and in Ruff they have a coach who has won 769 games in the NHL and is 167 games over .500 for his career.",
    "The Rangers being the team that ends our championship-drought misery around here would be some kind of story — and not anything close to something anyone saw coming.",
    "Jerry Vogel: Now that the Yankees made history by naming Rachel Balkovec manager of Tampa, are they going to change their archaic policy on hair below the collar?",
    "They may not be ready to win a Cup yet, but who’s going to want to face them in the playoffs, assuming they maintain the level they’ve played at through 39 games?",
    "And if it may not measure up to whatever championship era you want to cite, it’s still 110 games over .500 and the Yankees have made the playoffs every year.",
    "@MikeVacc: It’ll never be better than toggling back and forth between their games on Channel 9 and Channel 11 (back before we knew what “toggling” was).",
    "Get texts from Mike Vaccaro to be the first to know what he’s thinking about the ups and downs in New York sports and text back to share your thoughts.",
    "The miracle may not come this year, but the miracle has already happened: a GM and a coach with rings already in their safe-deposit boxes.",
    "Sean Marks-Steve Nash, Nets\nLook, we get it: We always tend to grade the Nets on a curve because they have who they have on the roster.",
    "Vac: I’m with my ride-or-die, Joel Sherman, on this one: The Yankees can afford to ease up on their hair restrictions across the board.",
    "Ron Darling compared Keith Hernandez’s arrival in New York to Mark Messier’s nine years later, and I think he got that exactly right.",
    "Still, you can’t simply discount the first three years of this partnership, which resulted in two appearances in the East finals.",
    "And the moment they win the Finals — if they win the Finals, when they win the Finals — they will vault up this list.",
    "There was nothing miraculous about it, unless you consider stupidity and complete incompetence a miracle.",
    "Disappointed, however, to see you refer to the Joe Pisarcik play, The Fumble, as that other phrase.",
    "And I think Carter will follow Hernandez to the wall, same as he followed him to the Mets’ roster.",
    "There are plenty of reasons to think they’ll have similar problems getting there this year.",
    "TruthinNews99: Keith Hernandez and Don Mattingly were a blessing to watch in the ’80s.",
    "Even if you couldn’t list any of his 50 funniest lines in a family newspaper.",
    "But at 0-0 so far, it feels if they have to start somewhere, it’s here.",
    "Some are still rated on spec, of course, but hey, that’s half the fun.",
    "Discussion, discourse and disagreement are welcome — and expected.",
    "But we also know that they couldn’t finish the journey last year.",
    "Assuming the Big 3 would have allowed that to happen, of course.",
    "There is no reason this can’t be a prosperous partnership.",
    "Vac: I stand before you contrite, and humbly corrected.",
    "Chris Drury-Gerard Gallant, Rangers\nSure, it’s early.",
    "Post Sports+ members, now you can Text Back at Vac.",
    "That’s the record for the Cashman-Boone duo.",
    "As we’ve learned, that isn’t always a given.",
    "It was, and always will be, The Fumble.",
    "Both men know what they’re doing.",
    "I really would like to be wrong.",
    "Vac: I think the door is opened.",
    "To which I would reply: 328-218.",
    "Goodness, Bob Saget was funny.",
    "Generally, it’s a good thing.",
    "That should be a good thing.",
    "Anyway, one man’s rankings.",
    "Whenever the games are on.",
    "Not a Sports+ member yet?",
    "Around here, right now?",
    "That’s a gold standard.",
    "I enjoy your writing.",
    "It just needs time.",
