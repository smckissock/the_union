    "“I mean, he’s got a lot of members very upset.”\nMcCarthy said that, during their private talk, he pointed to “certain things” Cawthorn needed to start doing professionally and in “his own life as well.” And he isn’t discounting more meetings with the freshman lawmaker, saying there “very well could be” more conversations with Cawthorn as GOP leaders assess “what actions are taken” by him.",
    "Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that, during their private talk, he pointed to “certain things” Madison Cawthorn needed to start doing professionally and in “his own life as well.” | Mark Wilson/Getty Images\nBy Olivia Beavers\n 03/30/2022 03:44 PM EDT\nUpdated: 03/30/2022 04:28 PM EDT\nKevin McCarthy is fed up with Madison Cawthorn.",
    "Cawthorn enraged wide swaths of his own conference when he recently claimed on a podcast that his colleagues have seemingly invited him to an orgy and that he watched at least one fellow lawmaker consume cocaine, claiming that the same member was involved in the anti-addiction efforts.",
    "House Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told POLITICO in an interview Wednesday that he plans to discuss the matter with Cawthorn, as more than one of the ultra-conservative members in the group rattle about kicking him out of the caucus.",
    "suggested he won’t be satisfied if the conversation with the GOP leaders ended with a simple promise from Cawthorn that he won’t make comments or suggestions like this again, noting that he has repeatedly caused headaches for the GOP conference.",
    "But we were very clear with the concerns we had — and a lot of other members too.”\nMcCarthy had vowed to GOP members behind closed doors that he would have a talk with the freshman about his remarks, POLITICO first reported Tuesday.",
    "Instead of a lawmaker, Cawthorn told McCarthy he believes “he thinks he saw maybe a staffer in a parking garage maybe 100 yards away,” and that Cawthorn told him “he doesn’t know what cocaine is.”\n“It is just frustrating.",
    "McCarthy was pressured to address another controversy within his ranks just weeks ago, when Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) attended an event led by a known white nationalist.",
    "The GOP leader said Wednesday — after meeting with the North Carolina Republican that morning — that Cawthorn has “lost my trust” due to his repeated actions that were “not becoming” for a congressman.",
    "Plus, Cawthorn had caused another controversy when he lied to an officer in the Capitol, saying GOP congressional candidate Robby Starbuck was one of his staffers to bring him onto the House floor.",
    "said in an interview that, during their meeting with Cawthorn, the House GOP’s top two leaders “expressed real concern with some of the things that he’s done recently.",
    "And McCarthy warned the freshman he could face punishment if he doesn’t take certain steps to turn himself around, which could include losing his committee spots.",
    "He’s going to have to earn it back,” McCarthy said when asked if Cawthorn could face consequences for his actions, including losing his committee positions.",
    "The remarks earned Cawthorn anger and opprobrium across the House GOP, including rank-and-file members who often stay quiet amid big political firestorms.",
    "Additionally, McCarthy said it’s unacceptable for a member of Congress to be caught driving without a license after failing to show up to court.",
    "In addition to the orgy-cocaine claims, McCarthy also cited Cawthorn’s calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug” as problematic.",
    "McCarthy was less critical about Greene’s behavior, saying he met with the Georgia firebrand on the matter and that she wouldn’t do it again.",
    "“You can’t make statements like that as a member of Congress, it affects everybody else and the country as a whole,” McCarthy added.",
    "It was a notable dressing down from a Republican leader who at other times has seemed content to leave troublesome members alone.",
    "And McCarthy had some information for Republican lawmakers who have called on Cawthorn to name names, too.",
    "The GOP leader said Cawthorn described the cocaine incident differently than he did in the podcast.",
    "Frankly, if western North Carolina is not going to fix the problem, then leadership will have to.”",
    "And it’s just the latest episode in a series of controversial remarks Cawthorn has made.",
    "“Depends on what the outcome of the meeting was,” Womack said in an interview.",
    "And obviously, the ball’s in his court in terms of how to respond.",
    "There is no evidence behind his statements,” McCarthy said.",
    "“If it’s: ‘Hey, don’t do that, again.’ We’ve been there.",
    "Scalise also attended the Wednesday morning meeting.",
    "“There’s a lot of different things that can happen.",
    "It may not be Cawthorn’s last meeting on the topic.",
    "House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)",
    "But I just told him he’s lost my trust.",
    "His ouster is still seen as unlikely.",
    "It is unclear if he met with Gosar.",
    "Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.)",
    "That hasn’t worked."
