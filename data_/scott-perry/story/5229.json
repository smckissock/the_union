Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the Jan. 6 committee.",

    "He subsequently claimed he left the U.S. Capitol area after the eruption of violence, which in the aftermath he called “unacceptable.”\nMastriano was unknown in state political circles when he won a May 2019 special election for a state Senate seat in a mostly rural district that straddles Interstate 81 along the Maryland-Pennsylvania state line.",
    "HARRISBURG — A Pennsylvania state senator who was in regular communication with Donald Trump as the then-president sought to reverse his 2020 election loss, and was outside the U.S. Capitol the afternoon of the Jan. 6 rioting, was subpoenaed Tuesday by the congressional committee looking into the insurrection.",
    "Days after President Joe Biden’s victory was certified in Pennsylvania, Mastriano sponsored a resolution in the Legislature to undo the certification, declare the election in dispute and effectively overturn state law by empowering the Republican-controlled Legislature to pick electors.",

    "Mastriano was among Trump’s most dedicated supporters during the 2020 campaign, and the night Trump’s loss became evident on Nov. 7, he addressed a few thousand disappointed Trump supporters outside the Pennsylvania Capitol.",
    "Mastriano traveled to the White House the evening of the Gettysburg hearing for a private event to strategize about the election results, but tested positive for covid-19 and had to leave.",
