    "He signed a four-year extension in the summer that will take effect after this season, but there are legitimate questions about whether Randle and the club as currently configured are the right path for the front office to count on as they move forward.",
    "Team president Leon Rose, executive vice president William Wesley and general manager Scott Perry have not spoken publicly since the start of training camp, but the remodeling of the roster in the summer has not worked as expected.",
    "The Knicks may trust Randle and RJ Barrett to be their building blocks, but they also have value if the Knicks attempt to trade for star talent rather than building around the edges, as they have done so far.",
    "So I’m not going to be happy and be all about it when things are good and just because it’s not necessarily going the way I want it to or the team wants it, to run and hide.",
    "Asked about the possibility of a trade, with his name coming up in rumors as Thursday’s trade deadline approaches, Randle countered by repeatedly asking, \"Who reported it?\"",

    "LOS ANGELES — Julius Randle was back where his NBA career began, readying to face the Lakers, the team that drafted him seventh overall in 2014.",
    "The offseason additions to the starting lineup, Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker, could have some value to contending teams in search of shooting.",
    "With Derrick Rose back soon after ankle surgery and Cam Reddish waiting for a chance, Alec Burks is expendable in the crowded backcourt.",
    "The Knicks began their five-game road trip with a 24-28 record that put them in 12th place in the Eastern Conference, far from the No.",
    "So even if Randle really wants to stay, the Knicks have to decide if this direction is the one that will get them to the next level.",
    "And even after a breakout season that ended just months ago, his status might be as uncertain now as it was when he started.",
    "It’s not just Randle whose name has surfaced in rumors, but he still holds more value than anyone else on the team.",
    "Randle took a similar stance last week when asked about his decision to sign the extension and lock into New York.",
    "The All-Star reserves were named Thursday, and it was no surprise that Randle got no consideration.",
    "\"The front office’s job is every day to look at all the possibilities,\" coach Tom Thibodeau said.",
    "But last season has faded into what seems like a distant memory as he has regressed on the court.",
    "He has seemed distant, he has warred with fans at home and the team has struggled with him.",
    "He then said, \"That sounds like gossip to me\" before finally getting to the point.",
    "\"I trust Wes, trust Leon, trust Scott, trust Jim [Dolan], everybody,\" Randle said.",
    "That’s part of the reason like we talked in the summer when I signed my extension.",
    "I still want to be a part of trying to bring a championship to the Knicks.",
    "\"What we need to do is focus on us and on the players who are here.",
    "If everyone concentrates on doing their job, it will all work out.",

    "\"I feel like they’ll do what’s best for the team.",
    "Everyone has a job to do in the organization.",
    "I’ll ride with it whatever way they go.\"",
    "I still want to see this thing through.",
    "\"I wouldn’t change it,\" he said then.",
    "\"You say what might need to be done?\"",
    "For us, we have to focus on our job.",
    "But it’s not just Randle’s choice.",
    "\"I still want to be a part of it.",
    "Be professional and do your job.\"",
    "I’m still sticking it through.\"",
    "That’s what we’re focused on.",
    "4 seed they had last season.",
    "I think they do a great job.",
    "It’s all part of the league.",
    "\"I just trust them, man.",
    "I’m still behind this.",
