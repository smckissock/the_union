    "These people, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity, said Cawthorn’s comments caught many of the group’s members by surprise.",
    "As Politico reports, there’s a line of high-ranking Republicans just waiting to have a word with Cawthorn.",
    "If Cawthorn was planning on accepting one of those orgy invites, he might be out of luck.",
    "The second rule of GOP Coke + Orgy Club is: you DO NOT TALK about GOP Coke + Orgy Club.",
    "The first rule of GOP Coke + Orgy Club is: you do not talk about GOP Coke + Orgy Club.",
    "Madison Cawthorn must have missed the memo, which seems surprising."
