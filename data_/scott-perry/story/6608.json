    "In a letter, Republicans plan to tell House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that their party is facing another crossroads where they \"must once again decide whether they will vote to fund a federal government that is enforcing tyrannical COVID-19 vaccine mandates on the American people.\"",
    "\"Therefore, we the undersigned refuse to consider supporting any federal government funding vehicle, be it a continuing resolution or an omnibus appropriations measure, that funds the enforcement of COVID-19 vaccine mandates at any level of government,\" they further pressed.",
    "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule, that businesses with at least 100 employees must require workers to get vaccinated or get tested weekly and wear a mask, was struck down by the Supreme Court at the beginning of January.",
    "Fox News Digital obtained a letter signed by a growing number of Republicans, led by Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, pledging to pull support from government funding legislation that includes language giving funds for vaccine mandates.",
    "They also point out that the Biden Administration has \"unilaterally imposed\" five COVID-19 vaccine mandates, referring to the mandates on medical workers, the military, federal employees, and federal government contractors.",
    "YOU DECIDE\nThe court ruled that OSHA lacked the authority to impose such a mandate on account of the law that created OSHA \"empowering the Secretary to set workplace safety standards, not broad public health measures.\"",
    "January 26, 2022\nThe current funding for the federal government is nearing a mid-February expiration date, meaning Congress will have to pass a continuing resolution or appropriations legislation to keep the lights on.",
    "\"Congressional Republicans cannot continue to abdicate their Article I duties in hopes the judicial branch will rule in favor of the American people,\" the GOP\nlawmakers are planning to say.",
    "The lawmakers are prepared to take aim at the \"myriad\nmunicipalities and states that directly benefit from federal funding\" resulting from the vaccine orders, including in Washington, D.C.",
    "\"Most Republicans say that vax mandates are tyrannical and foolish, but will they unite before government funding expires on Feb. 18 to pledge not to fund enforcement of these mandates?\"",
    "There are already over a dozen signatures, including GOP Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Paul Gosar of Arizona, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.",
    "The letter is making its way around the Hill this week as the February 18 federal funding deadline looms, and lawmakers have until the end of the day Friday to sign.",
    "Roy told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that he and his colleagues are \"going to find out\" whether the Republicans will \"unite\" and \"pledge not to fund these mandates.\"",
    "\"Will at least 10 of the 19 GOP senators who voted to punt last time now stand up for health care workers or not?\"",
    "OVER FAKE 'DON'T SAY GAY' BILL - WERE HER TEARS REAL?",
    "\"We're going to find out.\"",
    "he persisted.",
    "Roy asked."
