    "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Four Republican candidates for governor in the party's crowded primary race say they will not join a debate before the primary election unless it is moderated by a Republican who lives in Pennsylvania, eliciting criticism that they are afraid of hard questions.",
    "Another Republican candidate, Melissa Hart, said the four's \"diva-esque debate demands\" are hypocritical for men \"who will leap at the chance to bemoan 'cancel culture' or 'safe spaces' if they think it will earn them a spot on cable news that night.\"",

    "\"Republicans ought to pick the Republican candidate, and that means the debate process as well,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesperson for Barletta.",
