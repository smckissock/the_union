    "McConnell criticized the Republican National Committee for the censure of Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and disagreed with the committee’s description that investigators into the Jan. 6 insurrection were going after people over “legitimate political discourse.”\nMcConnell called Jan. 6 “a violent insurrection with the purpose of trying to prevent a peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election.”\nOn Thursday, Portman's office said the Republican from Terrace Park also does not believe Cheney and Kinzinger should have been censured.",
    "“Never-Trumpers Cheney and Kinzinger donated to my primary opponent last election, who went down in flames for his racially motivated tweets, and they’ve been cheerleaders for the forever wars and domestic spying, both of which I oppose,” Massie said in the statement.",
    "“The right to protest peacefully is protected under the Constitution and while there were lots of people demonstrating peacefully on that day in DC, there were also many who came up to the U.S. Capitol who were not,\" Portman said in the statement.",

    "Massie didn’t address the question of whether what happened Jan. 6 was “legitimate political discourse.” But he opposed censuring Cheney and Kinzinger, though he pointed out they donated to his primary opponent.",
    "I also co-wrote a bipartisan report to help prevent it from ever happening again and supported the creation of an independent, non-partisan commission.",
    "I voted to proceed on the House bill, but also advocated changes to the bill to ensure any commission was truly bipartisan.\"",
    "\"I believe Republicans share a common objective: Liz Cheney should not return to Congress,” Davidson said in the statement.",
    "Other Republican members in Ohio and Kentucky won't say publicly whether they agree with the RNC or McConnell.",
    "Follow-up calls to the rest of the delegation that represents the Cincinnati region were not returned.",
