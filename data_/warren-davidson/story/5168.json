    "The administration’s internal debate, described by three officials and congressional aides, has heated up, with some officials expressing caution that arming Ukrainian resistance could make the United States legally a co-combatant to a wider war with Russia and escalate tensions between the two nuclear powers.",
    "Over the past year, some administration officials have repeatedly warned against military moves that could inadvertently escalate tensions with Moscow.",
    "This led U.S. President Joe Biden to temporarily hold up sending U.S. defensive military aid to Ukraine despite buy-ins from other U.S. agencies.",
