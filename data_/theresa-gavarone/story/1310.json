    "\"The idea that Ohio will solve the drug crisis if we incarcerate all the drug traffickers is not realistic,\" said Niki Clum with the Ohio Public Defender's office last month, noting others will simply step in to make a profit off drugs.",

    "In addition, an effort to criminalize cheating an alcohol, drug or urine screening test was removed from the bill, after some advocates said it was too extreme.",
    "The goal is to fight the ongoing opioid crisis and other addictions by targeting the supplier, especially those who prey on recovering addicts, Gavarone said.",
    "Prosecutors would need to prove offenders \"knowingly\" violated the law instead of \"recklessly,\" which arguably narrows the scope.",
    "This is the third time Gavarone has spearheaded this legislation, with previous efforts ending right before the finish line.",
    "\"This is an idea I support, and look forward to the day I sign that provision into law,\" the governor had said then.",
    "Higher penalties would only apply if the crime happens within 500 feet of a treatment site, instead of 1,000.",
    "Criminal justice reform advocates fear it could disproportionately impact communities of color.",
    "DeWine vetoed it in 2020, but only because a COVID-related measure was added to it.",
    "Get more political analysis by listening to the Ohio Politics Explained podcast",
    "In response, Gavarone made some changes which have appeased some opponents.",
    "In many cases, a fourth-degree felony would become a third-degree one.",
