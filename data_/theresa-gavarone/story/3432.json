    "Gavarone's first bill protecting such beliefs died in 2020, but by then the high school athletic association had changed its rules to let referees approve use of religious head coverings if a coach asks before a competition, without a formal waiver.",
    "“For decades, that waiver had just been a normal process of head coverings, for medical reasons, religious, cultural, it was just a part of the sport,” said Tim Stried, director of media relations at the OHSAA.",
    "Noor Abukaram's elation at completing one of her first varsity cross-country races quickly turned to disappointment when she failed to find her name among those of her high school teammates on the results list.",

    "Gavarone, who is Roman Catholic, recalled the experience of her hockey and lacrosse player son who was allowed to wear a Christian cross under his pads as long as he taped it to his chest.",
    "“We need to reintroduce this because clearly rules are subject to change, and once discriminatory policies are put into place, people will still continue to enact them,” Abukaram said.",
    "“It was kind of like a no-brainer that what had happened to me was a form of discrimination and that religious freedom is something that everyone can agree on,” Abukaram said.",
    "At the time, Ohio High School Athletic Association rules banned most head coverings and caps unless competitors received religious exemption waivers in advance.",
    "Abukaram’s coach acknowledged making a mistake by not obtaining a waiver but said he didn’t think it was needed because it hadn’t been an issue at prior races.",
    "“No student athlete should ever have to choose between exercising their deeply held religious beliefs and participating in the sport they love,” Gavarone said.",
    "And not long after that, her plight caught the attention of state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, a Bowling Green Republican outraged at the girl's treatment.",
    "She was heartened not only by the bipartisan support for the bill but backing from other religious groups, including Christians and Jews.",
    "In Ohio, Abukaram didn't have long to wait before the world learned of her disqualification through a viral Facebook post by her cousin.",
    "Later in the year, the association approved the same rule change for basketball, softball, track and field, field hockey, and spirit.",
    "To Abukaram’s shock, she learned she’d been disqualified for something she’d done all season as a Muslim athlete: wear a hijab.",
    "Stried said Abukaram's disqualification led officials at the organization to question the necessity of the advanced waiver.",
    "Then, in spring 2020, Abukaram was incorrectly asked for a waiver before competing in the 1600-meter relay at a track race.",
    "Abukaram’s experience, and efforts to prevent similar episodes elsewhere, have garnered national attention recently.",
    "Abukaram, 18, is now a freshman at Ohio State studying fashion design and sports industry — and still a runner.",
    "“So it led to some change pretty quick.”\nGavarone hoped such attention on the issue would settle the matter.",
    "The House and Senate approved the legislation this year with broad bipartisan support, and Gov.",
    "She was allowed to compete but, fearing it would happen again, she contacted Gavarone.",
    "Anger at Abukaram's situation triggered her “inner hockey mom,” the senator said.",
    "“Why would we have the waiver there if it's natural to wear that?” he said.",
    "Previously, state athletic associations had to approve all head coverings.",
