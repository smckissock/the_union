    "Half of 1% used non-traditional forms of ID, like utility bills, to vote in the previous election, according to the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections.",
    "\"But the requirement that it has to have your current address is going to affect way more people in Ohio than what somebody would typically think.\"",
