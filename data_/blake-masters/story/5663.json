    "Billionaire venture capitalist and Paypal founder Peter Thiel has decided to leave the board of Meta Platforms (the company formerly known as Facebook) after its annual shareholder meeting in May, according to an announcement from the company released just after markets closed on Monday afternoon.",
    "According to reports published by Bloomberg and the NYT, Thiel is leaving Meta's board so he can focus on backing political candidates who support President Donald Trump's agenda during November's midterms, which Thiel sees as \"crucial to changing the direction of the country.\"",
    "\"Peter has been a valuable member of our board and I'm deeply grateful for everything he has done for our company - from believing in us when few others would, to teaching me so many lessons about business, economics, and the world.",
    "Here is a brief excerpt from a speech Thiel gave in October 2016 (forgive the Full Caps):\nI DON'T AGREE WITH EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID AND DONE, AND I DON'T THINK THE MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE VOTING FOR HIM DO EITHER.",

    "\"His focus will be on supporting Blake Masters, JD Vance and others who support the Trump agenda,” he added, referring to Republican candidates for U.S. Senate.",
    "IT IS NOT A LACK OF JUDGMENT THAT LEADS AMERICANS TO VOTE FOR TRUMP, WE ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP BECAUSE WE JUDGE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE FAILED.",
    "Thiel said in the press release that it had been \"a privilege\" working with Zuckerberg, whom he called \"one of the great entrepreneurs of our time.\"",
    "Thiel's Founders Fund bought its 10% stake in Facebook for a mere $500K, one of the best-performing VC investments in the history of the industry.",
    "IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN HARD TO ACCEPT FOR SILICON VALLEY, WHERE MANY PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED TO KEEP QUIET IF THEY DISSENT FROM THE COASTAL BUBBLE.",
    "As a reminder, Thiel helped elect Trump president in 2016 by donating money and speaking on his behalf at the Republican National Convention.",
    "He has served on our board for almost two decades, and we've always known that at some point he would devote his time to other interests.",
    "Thiel has been a member of Facebook's board since 2005, a year after CEO Mark Zuckerberg created the company in his Harvard dorm room.",
    "As such Thiel is clearly positioning himself as the conservative foil to the biggest financial banker of the Democrats, George Soros.",

    "IF YOU DON'T CONFORM, THEN YOU DON'T COUNT AS DIVERSE, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR PERSONAL BACKGROUND.",
    "But there's nothing to suggest this had any bearing on Thiel's decision to leave the board.",
    "\"It has been a privilege to work with one of the great entrepreneurs of our time.",
    "Mark Zuckerberg's intelligence, energy, and conscientiousness are tremendous.",
    "BUT I DON'T THINK THE VOTERS PULL THE LEVER TO ENDORSE A CANDIDATE'S FLAWS.",
