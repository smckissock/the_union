    "While I’m disappointed he decided not to run, Arizona will be an important part of our plan to win the majority back.”\nChris Hartline, a spokesperson for the NRSC, said Republicans “have great candidates running in Arizona, one of whom will beat Mark Kelly in November.”\nDucey’s decision to bypass the race removes a potential obstacle for the other Republican candidates, including state Attorney General Mark Brnovich; Blake Masters, a venture capitalist; and Jim Lamon, an energy executive self-funding his campaign.",
    "He said “right now I have the job I want, and my intention is to close my years of service to Arizona with a very productive final legislative session AND to help elect Republican governors across the country in my role as chairman of the Republican Governors Association.”\nHis comments to his financial backers echo similar public statements the governor has made for the past year, but the looming filing deadline give them a finality that until now has been lacking.",
    "In recent weeks, they continued to hold out hope that Ducey would change his mind, believing that the governor’s across-the-board name recognition and well-oiled campaign infrastructure would make him an ideal Republican to take on Democratic Sen.

    "In June, the former president said the Ducey “could not get the nomination” for Senate if he ran, and Trump continued to disparage the governor in recent statements and during a rally in Arizona last month.",
    "“I consider him an historic figure and one of the Titans of the Senate, and I am supportive of everything he’s doing to elect Republican senators and wrest back control from Chuck Schumer,” Ducey said.",
    "Ducey in the letter recalled a conversation more than a decade ago with former U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl, who asked, “Are you an executive or are you a legislator?”\n“The answer was obvious,” Ducey wrote.",
