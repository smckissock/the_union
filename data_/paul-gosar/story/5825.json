    "Last November, Paul Gosar, Republican representative for Arizona, was officially censured by the House after sharing an animated video depicting him killing the Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking Biden.”\nShannon Watts, founder of the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, slammed the ad as “disgusting”:\nDISGUSTING: Former Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot and and seriously wounded 10 years ago.",
    "Jim Lamon, one of the MAGA Republicans competing in Arizona’s 2022 GOP U.S. Senate primary, is drawing criticism for a new campaign ad that depicts him shooting at President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly — who he is hoping to compete with in the general election, and whose wife, Gabby Giffords, survived an attempted murder in 2011.",
    "Lamon plays a Clint Eastwood-like character, and the music recalls Ennio Morricone’s work in Leone movies like “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” “Once Upon a Time in the West” and “A Fistful of Dollars.” Actors portraying Biden, Pelosi and Kelly, all clad in western attire, are described in the ad as “The D.C. Gang” — and Lamon shoots the guns out of their hands.",
    "It’s time for a showdown.”\nThe Guardian’s Gloria Oladipo reports, “Criticism towards the ad has been swift, with many people pointing out other recent instances of violent imagery used by members of the Republican Party.",
    "\\n\\nCheck out our new Super Bowl ad, The Showdown, here pic.twitter.com/mJTbFuS0du\n— Jim Lamon (@Jim Lamon) 1644516409\nLamon, also wearing western attire, declares, “The good people of Arizona have had enough of you.",
    ":\n— Aaron Rupar (@Aaron Rupar) 1644549330\nBad messaging aside, it's an absolute joke presenting Lamon as a tough and gritty gunslinger considering he's more of a \"Hyuk hyuk!\"",
    "The ad, which Lamon posted on Twitter on February 10, is made to look like one of Italian director Sergio Leone’s spaghetti westerns of the 1960s.",
    "Her husband\\u2019s Republican US Senate opponent, @jim_lamon, just put out an ad in which he shoots Mark Kelly and other Democrat leaders.",
    "#AzSenpic.twitter.com/eoBIJH8ap0\n— Shannon Watts (@Shannon Watts) 1644518090\nHere are some more reactions to Lamon’s ad.",
    "Arizona has had enough of the DC Gang\\u2019s open borders, high gas prices, and shifty politicians pushing us around.",

    "@CaptMarkKelly @JoeBiden @TeamPelosi, it\\u2019s time for a good old-fashioned showdown."
