    "Bangor Daily News noted in a report that Dr. Nass’ license suspension is “part of a growing national trend of disciplinary actions against medical professionals accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19.”\nThe outlet reported that the licensure board’s “preliminary inquiry alleges Nass repeatedly failed to follow basic ‘standards of practice’ during telemedicine appointments with COVID-19 patients and admitted to espousing conspiracy theories about the government’s pandemic response.”\nKeep in mind that the majority of the so-called “conspiracy theories” about the COVID scam have turned out to be true yet doctors like Nass are still being punished anyway.",
    "Bangor Daily News also reported that another physician, Dr. Paul Gosselin, has “also had his license suspended last month by the osteopathic board over allegations of spreading misinformation and other potential misconduct.”\nBy “misconduct” we can assume that the allegations against these doctors are referring to their use of drugs like ivermectin, which has been shown to improve COVID symptoms by 67% across 67 controlled studies (screenshot here) and hydroxychloroquine that has been part of 298 studies that have shown a 64% improvement in COVID patients (screenshot here).",
    "“The information received by the Board demonstrates that Dr. Nass is or may be unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety to her patients by reason of mental illness, alcohol intemperance, excessive use of drugs, narcotics, or as a result of a mental or physical condition interfering with the competent practice of medicine,” the evaluation order states.",
