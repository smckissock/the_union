    "Republicans immediately derided Biden’s pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court – while Democratic leaders are hoping for bipartisan support; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insists the nation needs a strong Republican party – meanwhile radicals like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, who fantasize about committing acts of violence against Democrats, are embraced by fellow Republicans, proving they are not just a extremist fringe that has “hijacked” the Party, as Pelosi suggested.",
    "And when Texas senator Ted Cruz recently intimated that Republicans would impeach Biden if they were to retake the House “whether it’s justified or not,” the White House responded by calling on Cruz to “work with us on getting something done.”\nRepublicans could not be clearer about the fact that they consider Democratic governance fundamentally illegitimate, yet some establishment Democrats act as if politics as usual is still an option and a return to “normalcy” imminent.",
    "From that vantage point, it is rational to believe that the bigger immediate threat is coming from the “Left”: an agenda seeking to transform America from a restricted, white men’s democracy that largely preserved existing hierarchies to a functioning multiracial, pluralistic, social democracy is indeed a losing proposition for people who have traditionally been at the top.",
    "Many establishment Democrats seem to believe that it is high time to push back against the “radical” forces of leftism and “wokeism.”\nThe constant attempts to normalize a radicalizing Republican Party also have a lot to do with two foundational myths that shape the collective imaginary: the myth of American exceptionalism and the myth of white innocence.",
    "We may be decades removed from the heyday of the so-called “liberal consensus” of the postwar era, but much of the country’s Democratic elite still subscribes to an exceptionalist understanding that America is fundamentally good and the US inexorably on its way to overcoming whatever vestigial problems there might still be.",
    "The idea of white innocence also clouds Democratic elites’ perspective on Republican elites: Since they cannot possibly be animated by reactionary white nationalism, they must be motivated by more benign forces, fear of the Trumpian base perhaps, or maybe they are being seduced by the dangerous demagogue.",
    "The dogma of white innocence leads to elite opinion instinctively sanitizing the reasons behind the rise of rightwing demagogues, a common tendency in the commentary surrounding the success of George Wallace in the late 1960s, David Duke in early 1990s, or Donald Trump in 2016.",
    "Beyond institutional tradition and personal familiarity, this inability to grapple in earnest with the post-Obama reality in which Democratic politicians are almost universally considered members of an “Un-American” faction by most Republicans has deeper ideological roots.",
    "Republicans could not be clearer about their cynicism, yet some establishment Democrats act as if politics as usual is still an option\nOver the past few weeks, President Joe Biden has repeatedly emphasized his friendship with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell.",
    "When California senator Dianne Feinstein hugged South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham at the end of the Amy Coney Barrett hearings in 2020, it was a bizarre throwback to those days of amity across party lines in the midst of a naked Republican power grab.",
    "He has been reluctant to make the fight against the Republican party’s assault on democracy the center piece of his agenda; Democratic leadership has proved mostly unwilling to focus the public’s attention on the Republican party’s authoritarian turn.",
    "It’s the manifestation of a specific worldview that makes it nearly impossible to acknowledge the depths of Republican radicalization – a perspective that severely hampers the fight for the survival of American democracy.",
    "Thomas Zimmer is a visiting professor at Georgetown University, focused on the history of democracy and its discontents in the United States, and a Guardian US contributing opinion writer\n… we have a small favour to ask.",
    "“I actually like Mitch McConnell,” Biden said during a press conference a few weeks ago, providing a window into what he sees in Republicans: No matter what they do, underneath they’re good guys, they’ll snap out of it.",
    "Their perspective on the prospect of a white reactionary regime is influenced by the fact that, consciously or not, they understand that their elite status wouldn’t necessarily be affected all that much.",
    "Tens of millions have placed their trust in the Guardian’s fearless journalism since we started publishing 200 years ago, turning to us in moments of crisis, uncertainty, solidarity and hope.",
    "Economic anxiety, anti-elite backlash, or just liberals being mean – whatever animates white people’s extremism, it must not be racism, and they cannot be blamed for their actions.",
    "Greater numbers of people can keep track of the global events shaping our world, understand their impact on people and communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action.",
    "The way some establishment Democrats have acted suggests they feel a kinship with their Republican opponents grounded in a worldview of white elite centrism.",
    "The Republican dogma – that the world works best if it’s run by prosperous white folks – has a certain appeal to wealthy white elites, regardless of party.",
    "Going back to the Obama era, McConnell has led the Republican Party in a strategy of near-total obstruction which he has pursued with ruthless cynicism.",
    "There is no reason to be nostalgic about this – the politics of bipartisan consensus more often than not stifled racial and social progress.",
    "But McConnell is also sabotaging any effort to counter the Republican party’s ongoing authoritarian assault on the political system.",
    "More than 1.5 million supporters, from 180 countries, now power us financially – keeping us open to all, and fiercely independent.",
    "They came up in a very different political environment, when there was indeed a great deal of bipartisan cooperation in Congress.",
    "Just the determination and passion to deliver high-impact global reporting, always free from commercial or political influence.",
    "I’m not a socialist”, and instead emphasizes his friendship with Mitch McConnell, he offers more than strategic rhetoric.",
    "This often goes hand in hand with a mythical tale of America’s past, describing democracy as being exceptionally stable.",
    "Thank you for being my friend.”\nBiden’s publicly professed affinity is weirdly at odds with the political situation.",
    "At the National Prayer Breakfast in early February, for instance, he praised McConnell as “a man of your word.",
    "It is true that he has, at times, signaled distance to Donald Trump and condemned the January 6 insurrection.",
    "Finally, the American political discourse is still significantly shaped by the paradigm of white innocence.",
    "Millions can benefit from open access to quality, truthful news, regardless of their ability to pay for it.",
    "Never mind that genuine multiracial democracy has actually existed for less than 60 years in this country.",
    "The distinct asymmetry in the way the two sides treat each other extends well beyond Biden and McConnell.",
    "Reporting like this is vital for democracy, for fairness and to demand better from the powerful.",
    "Acknowledging what the Republican party has become goes against the pillars of that worldview.",
    "But there was certainly an established norm of intra-party cooperation until quite recently.",
    "Every contribution, however big or small, powers our journalism and sustains our future.",
    "What could possibly threaten America’s supposedly “old, consolidated” democracy?",
    "Unlike many others, the Guardian has no shareholders and no billionaire owner.",
    "Democrats are eager to present themselves as a force of moderation and unity.",
    "One important explanatory factor is that many Democratic leaders are old.",
    "But Biden’s longing for understanding across party lines seems sincere.",
    "?Support the Guardian from as little as $1 – it only takes a minute.",
    "There is certainly an element of political strategy in all of this.",
    "And we provide all this for free, for everyone to read.",
    "We do this because we believe in information equality.",
    "If there were ever a time to join us, it is now.",
    "When Biden insists that “I’m not Bernie Sanders.",
    "And you’re a man of honor.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Promise.",
