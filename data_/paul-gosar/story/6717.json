    "Section Three of the 14th Amendment concludes with a key phrase that refers to the insurrectionist disqualification, or disability: “Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.” Congress did just that, he said, with the Amnesty Act of 1872 that declared that “all political disabilities imposed by the third section” of the 14th Amendment were “hereby removed from all persons whomsoever.”\nGerard N. Magliocca, an expert witness for the complainants and a law professor at Indiana University who has written on the constitutional section in question, said Bopp was wrong.",
    "That section declares that “no person shall” hold “any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath” to “support the Constitution,” had then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”\nCawthorn, 26, who is in his first term in Congress, has denounced the case as an egregious misreading of the 14th Amendment, but he has retained James Bopp Jr., one of the most prominent conservative campaign lawyers in the country, as counsel.",

    "The lawyers challenging Cawthorn’s eligibility are using an amendment last invoked in 1920, when Rep. Victor L. Berger, an Austrian American socialist, was denied his seat representing Wisconsin after criticizing the U.S.’ involvement in World War I.",
    "“It just so happens that Madison Cawthorn is the tip of the spear.”\nAdvertising\n Skip Ad\nNorth Carolina’s election statute offers challengers a remarkably low bar to question a candidate’s constitutional qualifications for office.",
