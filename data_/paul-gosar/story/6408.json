    "| Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\nBy Nicholas Wu and Kyle Cheney\n 01/19/2022 06:30 PM EST\nThe panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection on Wednesday subpoenaed two fringe far-right figures, known for spreading misinformation about the results of the 2020 election and urging Republicans to overturn it.",
    "“We believe the individuals we have subpoenaed today have information relevant to those questions, and we expect them to cooperate with the committee.”\nBoth figures are asked to produce documents by Feb. 2 and to appear for a deposition by Feb. 9.",
    "Nick Fuentes, a head of the extremist America First movement, has gained prominence by agitating false claims about election fraud and was on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021, although there’s no evidence he entered the building.",
    "Nicholas Fuentes marches through the streets while speaking to people associated with the far-right group America First who attend an anti-vaccine protest in front of Gracie Mansion on November 13, 2021 in New York City.",
    "Fuentes, a white nationalist who celebrated the attack in its aftermath, notably hosted Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) as a keynote speaker at a conference last year, just weeks after the attack.",
    "“The Select Committee is seeking facts about the planning, coordination, and funding of events that preceded the violent attack on our democracy,” Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.)",
    "The two figures, through their attorneys, had previously declined voluntary requests to appear and produce documents last November, according to the committee.",
    "Patrick Casey was also a leader of the America First movement and similarly advocated false claims of election fraud.",
    "He promoted Jan. 5 and 6 events on his Telegram account, used for encrypted messaging, according to the committee.",
    "Investigators also cited an email from his attorney placing him outside the Capitol on Jan. 6.",
    "said in a statement."
