    "Instead, she released a statement in which she (1) re-upped video of her speech and (2) blamed any backlash she has received on Democrats and “Pharisees in the Republican Party.”\nOn Sunday, the same day that Greene effectively doubled down on her appearance at the event, Mitt Romney referred to the congresswoman and Representative Paul Gosar, who spoke at the event last year, as “morons.” He added: “I have to think anybody that would sit down with white nationalists and speak at their conference was certainly missing a few IQ points.” In a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the DNC, said: “In any other world, Greene speaking at a white supremacist conference where attendees have defended Vladimir Putin and praised Adolf Hitler would warrant expulsion from the caucus, to say nothing of her advocacy for violence and consistent anti-Semitism is disgusting.” Unfortunately, we expect the congresswoman will be shown the door on—just kidding, never, because Kevin McCarthy is apparently fine with all of this.",
    "As you’ve no doubt heard by now, over the weekend, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared as a guest speaker at a conference organized by a white nationalist, where attendees praised Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler and dubbed the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol “awesome.” Held as counterprogramming to the Conservative Political Action Conference—which, what with its attempts to not be completely overt about its racism and anti-Semitism is apparently way too mainstream for the fascist-inclined—the America First Political Action Conference was put on by far-right figure Nick Fuentes, whom the Anti-Defamation League has labeled a “prominent white supremacist pundit.”\nHow big of a bigot is Fuentes?",

    "If you didn’t catch the ADL’s description of him just now and need more specifics, he reportedly has: asserted that “whites are under attack”; said that there is going to be a “genocide” on young white men; criticized interracial marriage; suggested that Black people were too sensitive about the unfairness of racist Jim Crow era laws (“Oh no, they had to go to different schools.",
    "I’m not advising that, but I mean, what else are you going to do?”\nNow, Marjorie Taylor Greene has her own history of outrageous remarks, including anti-Semitic ones—Jewish space lasers anyone?—but even the craziest sitting members of Congress tend not to want to be associated with people who publicly suggest, among other things, that Adolf Hitler was a great guy.",
    "), she initially attempted to dodge questions from reporters about her appearance at the event, then claimed to have no idea who Fuentes was, saying she only agreed to speak at the conference because he has a “very large following.” (As an aside, she threw in a denouncement of Putin, while making sure to blame everything on Joe Biden.)",
    "(On Friday, Fuentes “joked” to the crowd: “Now they’re going on about Russia and Vladimir Putin is Hitler—and they say that’s not a good thing.“) This is probably why, following her speech (which covered such topics as “cancel culture,” Democrats as enemies of the state, that “abortion is genocide,” etc.",
    "But just for yuks, let’s pretend no one on Team MTG had any idea the congresswoman was signing up to speak at an event put on by such a thoroughly despicable human being, and she went up there thinking he was a swell guy.",
