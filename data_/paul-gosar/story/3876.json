    "He attacked AFPAC’s founder, 23-year-old internet entrepreneur and nationalist activist Nick Fuentes, as “one of the worst human beings I’ve ever come across.”\n“I f—-ing hate Nick Fuentes,” Crenshaw (last seen bullying a Texas schoolgirl who challenged his blasphemous comments about Jesus) fumed to CNN.",
    "Rejecting Black Lives Matter, monument destruction and the martyrdom of George Floyd, Peterson asserted unapologetically: “White people built America, and we need to remember that.”\nStating facts like these will earn you the fearmongering label of “white nationalist,” even if you’re not white!",
