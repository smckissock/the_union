    "In Salem, Oregon—which has emerged as a hotspot for political violence and been the backdrop to several bloody brawls between far-right groups and leftists—they’ve provided “security” for the Church at Planned Parenthood, offering to protect the event from “antifa.”\n“We have the Proud Boys across the street,” Peters, from the Church of Planned Parenthood, said in a livestream from one Salem event in July, turning the camera to a group of men in the group’s uniform.",
    "Last month, uniformed members of the preppy, fitness-obsessed white nationalist group Patriot Front gatecrashed two separate March for Life events, in Chicago and Washington, D.C., carrying a flag that read “Strong Families Make Strong Nations.” In a leaked audio recording posted by Atlanta antifascists in December, Patriot Front leader Thomas Rousseau can be heard assuring members that they’d be warmly received by anti-abortion activists on the ground.",
    "Afterward, the president of March for Life released a statement condemning “any organization that seeks to exclude a person or group of people based on the color of their skin or any other characteristic.”\n“Part of the success of the anti-abortion movement has been in obscuring the links between the mainstream and the fringe.”\nPatriot Front leadership certainly treated the March for Life events as recruitment and propaganda opportunities.",
    "“The patriarchal movement wants to subvert women and put their bodies under the control of men, and it believes that women's roles are as a mother and a homemaker, but that abortion is also part of the plan to commit genocide or the Great Replacement.”\nAbortion—the idea that people, in this case white women, can choose to end their pregnancies—is anathema to this position.",
    "A 1998 Southern Poverty Law Center report remarked that “these-once distinct movements increasingly share an enemies list that includes the federal government, homosexuals, abortion facilities, and non-‘Christian’ religions.”\nThis history leaves anti-abortion activists, even those in the mainstream, susceptible to far-right talking points.",
    "A disclaimer says this information should only be used “to aid in the end of abortion through peaceful, legal means.”\nAs the U.S. finds itself in the throes of rising political violence and GOP policymakers increasingly cater to the fringe of anti-abortion politics, clinics and providers continue to find themselves in the crosshairs.",
    "“The fringe has always helped move the discourse farther to the right, and the center has appreciated that pull but has always had to pretend that they’re not a part of it.”\nToday, the anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue maintains a website listing names, photos, and business addresses of known abortion providers.",
    "“Christian nationalism really provides a bridge between the mainstream right and the white nationalist movement, so they can lean on the language of the Christian nationalism movement to propagandize and socialize people to their beliefs,” said Cassie Miller, senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center.",
    "If the millions-strong movement no longer has to focus on dismantling Roe, experts fear that it could splinter and its adherents could become more hardline, even violent—particularly since activists’ policies and tactics have already drifted further rightward and violence against abortion providers is now on the rise.",
    "“And the next thing you know, they’re following some white supremacist dude.”\nPublic-facing and internal chats from far-right extremist groups suggest that their interest in the politically connected anti-abortion world may also be driven by a desire to attract new recruits and make friends in high places.",
    "“The white power movement and the militant right has shown over and over again, when it faces issues that are highly popular and highly charged, like anti-abortion activism, many times they will just use that as an opportunistic galvanizing strategy rather than as a site of heartfelt belief,” Belew said.",
    "“That will set their genocidal plans and baby parts market back for months.”\n“I don’t know how the fire started, but I think we can all agree that the fire was more effective than any amount of anti-abortion marches, protests, fliers, websites, podcasts, videos, donations,” wrote another Telegram user.",
    "Some day we may all be in the trenches together in the fight against the slaughter of unborn children.”\nEric Rudolph, who was deeply immersed in the white supremacist Christian Identity sect, carried out at least four bombings between 1996 and 1998 that killed two people and injured more than 100.",
    "One of them is Republican Arizona congressman Paul Gosar, who was the keynote speaker at the 2021 America First Foundation’s conference “AFPAC” and recently defended Fuentes as a “young conservative Christian.”\nFuentes and his ilk are largely the byproduct of the highly politicized Trump era.",
    "But leaked chats from Patriot Front’s private servers obtained by antifascists and published by media collective Unicorn Riot did offer a glimpse into how Rousseau, an obsessive micromanager and propagandist, instructed members to adjust their conduct to make them seem more approachable.",
    "“These people at these March for Life events have really come to support us over the years.” It’s not clear if Rousseau was telling the truth about having built allies within the mainstream March for Life movement, or if he’d even had any contact with event organizers beforehand.",
    "Optics-savvy, opportunistic far-right groups have repeatedly found ways to exploit the deep divisions and national upheaval around the pandemic, resulting in the mainstreaming of extremist rhetoric and the ideological symbiosis of conservative politics with the far-right fringe.",
    "In the wake of Trump’s election, activists at the outskirts of the movement—who were often quicker to embrace Trump than the abortion opponents at the helm of top organizations in Washington, D.C.—pushed for bills that openly defied Roe and banned abortion early into pregnancy.",

    "One of the living legacies of that history, convicted clinic bomber John Brockhoeft, was among those cheering at the Knoxville Planned Parenthood clinic’s destruction—and one of the many anti-abortion personalities who showed up at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "In his 2005 confession, Rudolph said he was trying to send a message about the “abominable sanctioning of abortion on demand.”\nRudolph and other anti-abortion hard-liners found sympathetic ears among white supremacist and armed “patriot” groups active at that time.",
    "The breakdown of barriers between the extreme right and mainstream GOP also comes at a critical juncture for the anti-abortion movement, as the Supreme Court is likely just months away from gutting Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.",
    "“They might hear this stuff, but they might not know how to understand the rhetoric behind it and just think it’s about patriotism,” said Anthea Butler, chair of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to mainstream anti-abortion activists.",
    "“The anti-abortion movement, over time, has not always been a peaceful movement either,” said Kathleen Belew, an assistant professor of U.S. history at the University of Chicago and author of Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America.",
    "The Ohio Proud Boys chapter used their public-facing Telegram channel to go on a lengthy rant deploring the “barbarism in which our society finds itself” as a result of “mothers who, denying their very nature, agree to kill their own child” via abortion.",
    "“If you frame everything as an existential threat and a fight over good versus evil, you can really demonize your political opponents and make them seem not like political opponents but enemies,” said Miller, the Southern Poverty Law Center analyst.",
    "There’s no teeth in it at all,” read a post Fuentes shared on his Telegram channel, which boasts 45,000 followers, from another channel called the “Classical Theist.”\nFuentes regularly uses his platform to spew racism, antisemitism, and misogyny.",
    "“Oh, my goodness, thank God for the Proud Boys.” At least two of those events last summer descended into violence, as Proud Boys joined by other far-right activists brawled with counterprotesters outside the clinic, resulting in several arrests.",

    "However, the leaked chats revealed that many rank-and-file members and prospective applicants hold strong views on abortion—and suggested that their radicalization journey started with anti-abortion activism.",
    "“Do it, Lord.”\nIt’s difficult to determine whether far-right leaders are seriously committed to the issue du jour—in this case, abortion—or if they’re just looking to boost their brand and lure new members.",
