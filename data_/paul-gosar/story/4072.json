    "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican leaders in Congress are torn over what to do with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene after the congresswoman spoke at a weekend event organized by a white nationalist who marveled over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as the crowd erupted in chants of “Putin!”\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy called the congresswoman’s speech on the same stage “unacceptable.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said “there’s no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists.”\nYet it’s unclear whether Greene will face any further reprimand or rebuke for what is now an ongoing pattern of startling behavior.",
    "The group said it was “appalling and outrageous that a Member of Congress would share a platform with an individual who has actively spread antisemitic bile, mocked the Holocaust, and promoted dangerous anti-Israel conspiracy theories.”\nAdvertisement\nThe America First Political Action Committee was launched by Nick Fuentes, who is considered by anti-hate groups as a white nationalist.",
    "McConnell offered no public comments, but said in a statement from his office: ‘There’s no place in the Republican Party for white supremacists or anti-Semitism.”\nGreene defended her appearance at the America First Political Action Committee event, saying she will continue sharing her message to “every corner” of the US.",
    "“He won’t because she has power, let’s be honest, but I’m embarrassed by it.”\nThe scrutiny over the congresswoman, who remains an outlier on Capitol Hill, comes as most of Congress is largely unified in its condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin and its support of Ukraine.",
    "Greene kicked off the group’s weekend conference in Florida, which was billed as a far-right alternative to the more established Conservative Political Action Conference that drew Trump and other GOP elected officials to Orlando over the weekend.",

    "“This may be a chance to burn out the cancer of the Republican Party — those that are, you know, Putin sympathetic,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., a former military fighter pilot who broke with his party over the Trump presidency.",
    "This is not the first time Greene, of Georgia, has broken the norms of political behavior by associating with extremist groups, espousing conspiracy theories or musing about violence against politicians she disagrees with.",
    "Asked if Greene or the others should be kicked out of the GOP, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, once the party’s presidential nominee, said: “They should be laughed out.”\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",
    "But the organization is not unfamiliar to Greene or several other Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who has said they had briefly considered forming an America First Caucus in Congress.",
    "Ahead of President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union address, the invasion has proven to be a rare moment of common ground amid Democrats and Republicans as the US defends the Western-style democracy.",
    "Asked to elaborate Tuesday as cameras were rolling during a press conference at the Capitol, McCarthy demurred, declining further response, as other Republican leaders and lawmakers stood by.",

    "And it enables The Times of Israel to remain the place readers across the globe turn to for accurate news about Israel's relationship with the world.",
