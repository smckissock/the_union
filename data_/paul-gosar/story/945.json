    "Rep. Gosar begins his CPAC talk by attempting to distance himself from white nationalist Nick Fuentes\\u2019 AFPAC conference, where he spoke last night.pic.twitter.com/1JNgIowY5A\n— Zachary Petrizzo (@Zachary Petrizzo) 1614436753\nAfter that year's event, Fuentes posted a photo of the two men sharing drinks.",
    "Gosar's comments, originally reported by Politico, stem from his controversial virtual appearance at the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), held in Washington back in March by white nationalist Nick Fuentes.",
    "After weeks of avoiding the subject, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., is now blaming his own staff over his appearance at a white nationalist conference, claiming that \"there was a miscommunication.\"",
    "\"There is a group of young people that are becoming part of the election process and becoming a bigger force,\" Gosar said to a crowd of white nationalist youths at the time.",
    "Gosar's remarks are also dubious considering his attendance at AFPAC last year, which led to him missing a House vote on a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.",
    "After Gosar's AFPAC appearance this year, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy condemned the Arizona lawmaker, calling his conduct \"unacceptable.\"",
    "\"It wasn't supposed to go to Nick's group,\" Gosar claimed, alleging that his staff sent a pre-recorded \"welcome video\" to AFPAC.",
    "\"The party should not be associated any time any place with somebody who is anti-Semitic.",
    "It remains unclear why Gosar apparently waited five weeks to address the matter.",
    "And there's no place in our party for any of this,\" McCarthy said at the time.",
    "\"So why not take that energy and listen to what they've got to say?\"",
    "Gosar added that he's \"given up … on dealing with Nick.",
    "\"We're kind of short-handed,\" the conservative said.",
    "\"Great meeting today with Congressman Gosar!\"",
    "Nick's got a problem with his mouth.\"",
    "\"For me it was appalling and wrong.",
    "\"And there was miscommunication.\"",
    "\"America is truly uncancelled.\"",
    "Fuentes wrote."
