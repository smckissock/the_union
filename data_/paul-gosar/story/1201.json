    "The DOJ seems to think Alexander has some useful information on Trump officials and MAGA members of Congress:\nIn an indication that the inquiry could reach into the Trump administration and its allies in Congress, the subpoena also seeks information about members of the executive and legislative branches who were involved in the events or who may have helped to obstruct the certification of the 2020 election.",
    "Mr. Alexander said through his lawyer that in the run-up to Jan. 6 he spoke with Mr. Stone about “logistics” and the “warring factions” of organizers, and provided the House committee with all of his communications with Mr. Stone on the day of the Capitol attack.",
    "Via The Washington Post:\n“We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting,” Alexander said in a since-deleted video on Periscope highlighted by the Project on Government Oversight, an investigative nonprofit.",
    "Ditto for Alex Jones:\n[On Jan. 6th], Mr. Alexander attended Mr. Trump’s speech at the Ellipse, then marched with the crowd toward the Capitol, along with the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars.",
    "Alexander has already been deposed by the January 6th committee and “gave it a trove of documents that helped shed light on the activities that preceded the Capitol attack,” the Times reported.",
    "Last year, I wrote :\nOn the morning of January 6th, Alexander said, on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily show, “I got a call last night from Kimberly Guilfoyle, and none of us are stopping.",
    "The plan, he said, was to “change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body, hearing our loud roar from outside.”\nRoger Stone may have a sleepless night or two, also.",
    "More from the Times:\nMr. Alexander might also be able to shed light on some of the activities on Jan. 6 of a man he considers to be something of a mentor: Roger J.",
    "He arrived, as he put it in his prepared remarks to the House committee, “in the early stages of the lawbreaking.”\nMaybe Kimberly Guilfoyle, too.",
    "The New York Times broke the news that Alexander’s lawyer said he is taking “a cooperative posture” with the Justice Department’s investigation.",
    "As C&L has previously reported, Alexander has said he worked with each of them when planning events for January 6th.",
    "Marcy Wheeler is skeptical Alexander will be forthcoming:\nFolks:\nPlease stop falling for the \"Cooperate\" language.",
    "The family is not stopping.”\nGuilfoyle was subpoenaed by the Jan. 6th committee last month.",
    "That could be bad news for MAGA Reps. Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks.",
    "Of course, we don't know exactly what \"cooperate\" exactly means.",
    "https://t.co/XG2MWWC61c\n— emptywheel (@emptywheel) April 9, 2022",
    "We already have reason to believe he's not being forthcoming.",
    "\"Comply\" is what Alexander is claiming he'll do.",
    "Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump.",
    "And this statement is full of giant holes.",
    "StoptheSteal.us is not stopping.",
    "I know you’re not stopping, Ed.",
    "You're all smarter than that.",
    "I’m not stopping."
