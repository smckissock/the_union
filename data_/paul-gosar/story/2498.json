    "Not a few eyes were rolled at the sight of a freshman lawmaker taking up the mantle of Gingrich and putting forth what he called a “definitive roadmap… for my generation to reclaim our country.”\nLargely, the plan is a rehash of very old GOP ideas—cut spending, balance the budget—peppered with contemporary MAGA catnip, like requiring China to compensate the U.S. because of COVID-19 and banning critical race theory.",
    "“Nobody wants to help him.”\nIn response to questions from The Daily Beast, Cawthorn spokesman Luke Ball said Cawthorn has “fantastic working and personal relationships with an overwhelming majority of his GOP colleagues.” He said any suggestion that Cawthorn rejected mentorship outreach was false, and argued that unnamed sources disparaging a “rising star” in the party should not be taken seriously.",
    "In explaining his Ukraine comments, for instance, Cawthorn alleged that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “demonically possessed” but didn’t walk back his insults against Zelensky, instead saying war could have been prevented except for the “geriatric despot in the White House because of the stolen election.”\nCawthorn’s challengers clearly believe he is vulnerable to defeat.",
    "Edwards, a longtime state senator and well-known presence in the area, said in an interview that “the people of western North Carolina deserve a congressman who has their best interest in mind—not to build a political career.”\n“I believe that there is a distinct difference between a fighter and a fighter that has proven that they are a winner,” Edwards said.",
    "But Cawthorn did something far worse, at least for his own political prospects, and it may cost him his seat: He left his constituents—and then was forced to return to them, hat in hand, after the courts predictably struck down the state’s new map, and eliminated the district he left to run in, on Feb. 23.",
    "If the worst thing Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) did this month was call Ukraine’s President “a thug,” or get caught speeding multiple times with a revoked license, or accuse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of being an alcoholic, the 26-year-old MAGA-influencer would probably be just fine in his re-election bid.",
    "In addition to Woodhouse and Edwards—who jumped in the race after Cawthorn’s switch—he was already facing Navy vet Wendy Nevarez, who is in line with the Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) wing of the party, as well as local sheriff Rod Honeycutt and businessman Bruce O’Connell.",
    "The lawmaker’s campaign to win friends and influence people instead might be epitomized by an incident last July, when he got into a shouting match on the House floor with a respected senior member, Rep. David McKinley (R-WV), over a legislative misunderstanding.",
    "“His goal is to mold the GOP, both in North Carolina and around the nation, into a party that puts America first.”\nCawthorn’s closest allies on Capitol Hill might be his fellow MAGA brigade freshmen, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Lauren Boebert (R-CO).",
    "In December, Raleigh’s ABC affiliate reported that Cawthorn was circulating a proposal among state GOP politicos titled “Congressman Cawthorn’s Plan For North Carolina.” It helpfully informed his colleagues which districts they should run in under the new lines.",
    "Asked if he supported Cawthorn’s plan, Gingrich simply replied: “I’m for a lot of different guys having ideas.”\nIn the realm of electoral politics, where Cawthorn has really tried to flex his muscle, his recent track record has also been less than impressive.",
    "“It might shine for him in other places, it doesn't shine for him here.”\nNo matter Cawthorn’s fate back home, for many Republicans, the last year has shown that the young man once viewed as a rising star is now little more than a growing headache for the GOP.",
    "In February, Cawthorn made his biggest legislative splash yet, proposing an updated version of the “Contract With America”—the conservative set of principles that former Speaker Newt Gingrich famously championed when he took over the House in 1994.",
    "Greene has excelled at the outside political game, raising millions of dollars and somehow becoming a GOP power player, while Boebert has impressed many Republicans on Capitol Hill with her efforts to build clout inside the halls of Congress.",
    "On March 10, Cawthorn’s constituents heard him call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “thug” and the Ukrainian government “incredibly evil,” as both earned the world’s support and sympathy for heroic resistance to Russia’s invasion.",
    "In Texas’ Republican primaries earlier this month, two of Cawthorn’s chosen candidates failed to make runoff elections in their races, with one contest serving as a major proxy battle between him and GOP leadership.",
    "Like his ally Greene, Cawthorn has sought to position himself as a kingmaker—a national leader of the MAGA movement and a sought-after commodity on the speaking and rally circuit for various candidates nationwide.",
    "When he first came to Washington, several more established Republicans privately tried to mentor Cawthorn and bring him along—a well-meaning effort that he largely resisted, a senior GOP aide told The Daily Beast.",
    "After spending months campaigning in another district—and supporting Woodhouse—a state court undid the lines that prompted Cawthorn to make his big play, and the district he had moved to vanished in an instant.",
    "“The feeling,” Cooper said, “is that this is going to be an interesting primary.”\nIf Cawthorn’s headlines in the two weeks following the district re-switch are any indication, it will be more than interesting.",
    "Chris Cooper, a professor of political science at Western North Carolina University, explained that Cawthorn “is at risk” because of the PR blowback and because of the months he spent running somewhere else.",
    "Cawthorn’s own district-switching gambit, meanwhile, was baffling to GOP operatives, who could not understand why he decided to make such a splash when North Carolina’s maps were so likely to change again.",
    "Cooper, of Western North Carolina University, said voters in the district know Cawthorn largely for his string of controversies, but said many knew that’s what they were getting when they voted for him.",
    "The ingredients are there for an upset—one that might explain why Republicans are eager for someone else to take Cawthorn’s place and not turn a safe district into one the GOP has to even think about.",
    "In 2020, Cawthorn snuck up on a GOP establishment candidate backed by the district’s former representative, the onetime Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and pulled off a major upset in the primary.",
    "But when reached by The Daily Beast this week, Gingrich said he had “nothing to do” with Cawthorn’s plan; he couldn’t even recall ever having a “substantive” conversation with the young congressman.",
    "“When he decided to come back in, my phone blew up with calls—from within the district, across North Carolina, elected officials from D.C.—saying, ‘You have to stay in the race,’” Woodhouse said.",
    "The congressman’s “meteoric rise,” Ball said, “has angered some in the GOP’s old guard, and that’s ok.”\n“The Congressman is accountable to the people, not the Washington elites,” he continued.",
    "Meanwhile, Woodhouse said her campaign is working, ahead of the May primary, to communicate to voters that “you have a conservative in this race, who you can be proud of for their behavior...",
    "But his conduct has ensured that he will get limited help from Republicans—help that could be badly needed as he fights off a primary and, potentially, a well-funded Democratic challenger.",
    "Now that he was leaving to run in a newly drawn, more conservative seat closer to Charlotte, the congressman urged Woodhouse to get in the race for his current job—which she did.",
    "But if the congressman’s opponents can effectively capitalize on his district-switching screw-up, it could provide the missing ingredient for defeating him in a GOP primary.",
    "A senior GOP aide—granted anonymity to describe the mood of Republicans—said the consensus in the conference is that Cawthorn is more of a liability than anything else.",
    "Woodhouse, his primary opponent, recalled a recent meeting in which a Cawthorn aide bragged about how he gets stopped for pictures in every airport he travels through.",
    "If it weren’t for forsaking his district, even with all of his controversies and embarrassments, Cawthorn could likely have coasted through election season just fine.",
    "He traffics in stilted own-the-libs soundbites and aspirational MAGA mantras, both of which were in full force as he tried to fight off his torrid run of headlines.",
    "Then, local reports came out detailing how Cawthorn had his driver’s license revoked, drove without it anyway, and racked up a string of hefty speeding tickets.",
    "On March 14, video resurfaced of Cawthorn telling MAGA activist Charlie Kirk that he had brought “multiple weapons” with him to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.",
    "At this point, multiple GOP sources said Cawthorn has few friends on the Hill and, more to the point, probably does not realize how many enemies he’s made.",
    "The move not only potentially violated House ethics rules, it had the effect of angering Cawthorn’s colleagues and Republicans from D.C. to North Carolina.",
    "They heard Republicans—from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to his home state GOP Sen. Thom Tillis—respond to Cawthorn’s statements by rebuking him.",
    "The numerous candidates challenging Cawthorn in the GOP primary, slated for May, do not intend to let voters in North Carolina’s 11th District forget it.",
    "Cawthorn is familiar with that game: He defeated Republican Lynda Bennett in a runoff in 2020, after he finished second in the first round of voting.",
    "That forced Cawthorn to backtrack and run in his original district, in an attempt to reverse the game of political musical chairs he had kicked off.",
    "In 2021, Cawthorn raised over $2.8 million—an impressive sum, but far less than fellow firebrands like Greene, Boebert, and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL).",
    "It showed, at least briefly, that he was less interested in representing the voters who first elected him than he was in just being in Congress.",
    "Asked what, exactly, is the deal with him—what explains all this inexplicable behavior—she turned to the Bible’s story of David and Goliath.",
    "And they really didn’t understand why Cawthorn—even more bafflingly—took it upon himself to decide where his GOP colleagues should run.",
    "That is not exactly surprising, given that Cawthorn told all of his colleagues that he built his staff around “comms,” not legislation.",
    "Among his colleagues in Congress, patience with the young congressman is running out, according to several House Republican sources.",
    "Last year, he quickly endorsed Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) to run for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Richard Burr.",
    "In his year-end 2021 filing, he had one-tenth of what he raised—just $282,000 on hand, with $177,000 in outstanding debts.",
    "As did Chuck Edwards, a respected state senator, bringing the total of viable Cawthorn challengers to nearly a half-dozen.",
    "The brouhaha culminated in Cawthorn insulting McKinley and his staff, who then slapped Cawthorn with an ethics complaint.",
    "The telegenic Cawthorn may have a made-for-TV jawline, but what comes out of it is, largely, a stream of embarrassment.",
    "When it comes to his legislative record, none of his more than 30 sponsored bills have so much as gotten a hearing.",
    "When Cawthorn announced last November that he would run in a different district than the 11th, he called Woodhouse.",
    "I won’t be on the front page of the Asheville Citizen-Times for a gun or knife.”\nWoodhouse knows Cawthorn well.",
    "Cawthorn told Fox News that he talked to Gingrich about the plan, and that he hoped to get his endorsement.",
    "It’s unclear who, if anyone, has signed Cawthorn’s contract, which has not yet been filed as a resolution.",
    "If Cawthorn does not clear 31 percent of the vote in the May 17 primary, however, things get interesting.",
    "“Some people will excuse it as youth, but at 26 years old… at a certain point, you're not young anymore.",
    "He then capped it all off by publicly suggesting that Pelosi—who famously doesn’t drink—is an alcoholic.",
    "Unlike many lawmakers facing electoral competition, Cawthorn has gotten few checks from GOP allies.",

    "They urged her to continue her campaign—even if her primary opponent was now Cawthorn himself.",
    "For MAGA-brand politicians like Cawthorn, antagonizing the establishment is a badge of honor.",
    "Ball denies that Cawthorn endorsed her, even though the congressman donated to her campaign.)",
    "Woodhouse says she regularly hears from voters who say they will never support him again.",
    "“The sparkle and buzz around him here—locally, that penny is no longer shiny,” she said.",
    "Part of the problem for Cawthorn is that he just can’t stop producing cringey headlines.",
    "But Walker seems to have faded to a third-place spoiler role as the primary draws near.",
    "Predictably, he has been more successful at getting headlines than legislative results.",
    "(Last year, it was reported that Cawthorn tried to bring a loaded Glock onto a plane.)",
    "Some plugged-in GOP operatives believe that Cawthorn remains the odds-on favorite.",
    "It likely limits not only his star power in the GOP but also his staying power.",
    "But a closer comparison between them isn’t especially flattering to Cawthorn.",

    "For Cawthorn, it was just the beginning.",
    "This time, he made no call to Woodhouse.",
    "“Nobody wants his help,” the aide said.",
    "Power, said Woodhouse, has changed him.",
    "One of them is Michele Woodhouse.",
