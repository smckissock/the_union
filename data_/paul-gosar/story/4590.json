    "Journalist Judd Legum and economist/New York Times columnist Paul Krugman have commented on Scott’s desire to raise taxes on Americans who aren’t rich:\nImportant thread where @NRSC chair Rick Scott defends his plan to raise taxes on hundreds of millions of Americans.https://twitter.com/scottforflorida/status/1496496516701331460\\u00a0\\u2026\n— Judd Legum (@Judd Legum) 1645631798\nI'm sure someone else has pointed this out, but Rick Scott's \"Rescue America\" plan doesn't just call for tax hikes on the majority of Americans, but for a big implicit cut for tax cheats; \"We will immediately cut the IRS funding and workforce by 50%.",
    "It is true that he has, at times, signaled distance to Donald Trump and condemned the January 6 insurrection, but McConnell is also sabotaging any effort to counter the Republican Party’s ongoing authoritarian assault on the political system.”\nSen. Rick Scott of Florida has unveiled an 11-point blueprint for GOP talking points that he recommends for Republican candidates in the 2022 midterms, and its tone is bitterly divisive.",
    "“Meanwhile, radicals like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, who fantasize about committing acts of violence against Democrats, are embraced by fellow Republicans, proving they are not just an extremist fringe that has ‘hijacked’ the Party, as Pelosi suggested.”\nThe history professor concludes his op-ed on a disturbing note, arguing that Democrats are being naïve if they underestimate the “radicalization” of the 2022 GOP.",
    "And similarly, visiting Georgetown University history professor Thomas Zimmer laments, in an op-ed published by The Guardian on February 22, that there can be no “politics as usual” when the GOP of 2022 is so “radicalized.”\n“Republicans could not be clearer about the fact that they consider Democratic governance fundamentally illegitimate,” Zimmer writes.",
    "But “Real Time” host Bill Maher — a liberal with a libertarian streak — has been warning that the MAGA movement and much of the modern GOP is dangerously authoritarian and that the days of conservative President Ronald Reagan and liberal House Speaker Tip O’Neill having a cordial relationship despite their policy differences are long gone.",
    "@chuckschumer and the Democrats\\u2019 fake outrage about my plan further illustrates just how out of touch they are with the American public.\\u00a0Americans want everyone to pay their fair share.\\u00a0Working Americans all pay taxes on their income, and retirees already paid plenty.",
    "“Yet some establishment Democrats act as if politics as usual is still an option and a return to ‘normalcy’ imminent.”\nZimmer cites Biden’s friendly tone with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as an example of his desire for bipartisanship.",
    "President Joe Biden is fond of bipartisanship and hasn’t hesitated to brag about his relationship with the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona and all the other Republicans he worked closely with during his decades in the U.S. Senate.",
    "“It’s the manifestation of a specific worldview that makes it nearly impossible to acknowledge the depths of Republican radicalization — a perspective that severely hampers the fight for the survival of American democracy.”",
    "“‘I actually like Mitch McConnell,’ Biden said during a press conference a few weeks ago, providing a window into what he sees in Republicans — no matter what they do, underneath they’re good guys, they’ll snap out of it.",
    "— Rick Scott (@Rick Scott) 1645627547\nZimmer, in his Guardian op-ed, goes on to argue that Biden isn’t the only Democrat who is “hoping for bipartisan support” while MAGA Republicans declare war on U.S. democracy.",
    "McConnell was first elected to the Senate in 1984, and they were in the Senate together up until Biden’s inauguration as vice president under President Barack Obama in January 2009.",
    "“Over the past few weeks,” Zimmer explains, “President Joe Biden has repeatedly emphasized his friendship with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.",
    "And to a degree, that approach has worked: many right-wing conservatives, from GOP activist Cindy McCain (Sen. McCain’s widow) to former Ohio Gov.",
    "Thank you for being my friend.’”\nZimmer continues, “Biden’s publicly professed affinity is weirdly at odds with the political situation….",
    "Bipartisanship, according to Maher, doesn’t work when MAGA extremists don’t even believe that Biden has the right to govern.",
    "The 79-year-old Biden and the 80-year-old McConnell go way back and served in the U.S. Senate together for 24 years.",
    "John Kasich to former Sen. Jeff Flake to Washington Post columnist George Will, endorsed Biden in the 2020 election.",
    "At the National Prayer Breakfast in early February, for instance, he praised McConnell as ‘a man of your word.",
    "“House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insists the nation needs a strong Republican Party,” Zimmer observes.",
    "\"https://rescueamerica.com/11-point-plan/\n— Paul Krugman (@Paul Krugman) 1645628640\n.",
    "And you’re a man of honor.",
    "Promise,” Zimmer writes."
