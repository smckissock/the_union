    "She pals around w/Nazis bc she thinks the GOP should be a tent big enough for them but NOT for those who voted to impeach Trump...\n— Tim Wise (@timjacobwise) March 1, 2022\nWhile House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has vowed to give both Greene and Gosar (another) stern talking-to, the Republican Party appears unwilling to expose them to censure—an extraordinary disciplinary measure they appear to reserve solely for members who investigate coups against the legitimate government of the United States.",
    "Voters can still save the country, but Democrats have to help them\nDaily Kos' The Brief\nFollowShare\n0:0058:38\n15301x\n image/svg+xml\nPowered by Libsyn\nPowered by Libsyn\nMeanwhile, according to POLITICO, both Gosar and Greene have apparently lost the benefit of the doubt among most congressional Republicans, who would likely prefer they keep their racism cloaked behind a thin veneer of respectability.",
    "According to Gosar, his staff is currently shorthanded, and “there was a miscommunication.” Which is odd, because after he spoke in person at the same conference in 2021, you’d think he might have put his foot down and removed the white nationalist group from his iPhone or Rolodex or fish pail full of Post-It Notes or whatever the disgraced dentist uses to organize his contact list.",
    "Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, whom God created to conclusively disprove white supremacy, is trying to explain away his video appearance at shrieking anti-Semite Nick Fuentes’ white power-palooza carnival in February, and that explanation is just as craven as you might imagine.",
    "A new development from The Arizona Mirror:\nPrescott Republican Congressman Paul Gosar is set to be a “special guest” with the white nationalist American Populist Union at an event that will be on a date popular among white nationalists and Neo-Nazis: Hitler’s birthday.",
    "That might pass as an explanation if not for this:\nThe first results when you Google Fuentes' name identify him as a white nationalist who has compared baking cookies to the Holocaust's mass murder of Jews, among other incendiary and discriminatory statements.",
    "The American Populist Union is closely aligned with groypers, a group of white nationalists who strive for their ideas to become a part of the Republican mainstream and are largely followers of 23-year-old white nationalist Nick Fuentes.",
    "Wednesday, Apr 6, 2022 · 4:42:59 PM Pacific Daylight Time · Aldous J Pennyfarthing\nWell, you can take the white supremacist out of the white supremacy event, but you can’t take the white supremacy out of the white supremacist.",
    "And, of course, Gosar and Greene were among the 63 House members (all Republicans) who on Tuesday voted against a resolution supporting NATO—which is likely the biggest gift they can get away with giving Putin at the moment.",
    "Gosar, who has the intellectual heft of chilled monkey brains and looks like he cuts his own hair with an intermittent series of controlled burns, seems to think white people are superior to other races.",
    "Famously, Gosar claims he “didn't know anything about the group” before speaking at the event last year; Rep. Greene made a similar comment following her appearance at the conference this year.",
    "POLITICO:\nGosar’s denial — among the first public remarks he’s given on the matter — comes nearly a month after the furor over his appearance at Fuentes' event consumed the House GOP.",
    "And now, more than a month after appearing via video at Fuentes’ America First Political Action Conference, Gosar is addressing the controversy—by blaming his staff.",
    "What he’s saying: “It wasn't supposed to go to Nick’s group,” Gosar told POLITICO, noting that a staffer “misconstrued” directions from his chief of staff.",
    "Fool me twice, shame on my underpaid, overworked staff, who should have recalled from my appearance last year that this was a white nationalist event.",
    "Listen and subscribe to Daily Kos' The Brief podcast with Markos Moulitsas and Kerry Eleveld\nx\nx\nYou need to enable JavaScript to run this app.",
    "x\n1/ Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Dachau) stood backstage, heard Nick Fuentes praise Putin & Hitler, and still came out to speak at AFPAC.",
    "Can we give a round of applause for Russia?” – Trump-supporting Republican Nick Fuentes at AFPAC conference with @RepMTG\n“Putin!",
    "It made comedian Sarah Silverman say, “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT,” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!",
    "[Crowd cheers and chants ‘Putin, Putin, Putin!’] Absolutely, absolutely.”\nAnd as Tim Wise notes, Greene still came on out.",
    "Now, that’s an assertion that might seem slanderous if not for his repeated participation in white supremacist events.",
    "The American Populist Social will be held in Tempe on April 20, a date revered by white supremacists and Neo-Nazis.",
    "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Gosar both appeared at Fuentes' America First Political Action Conference.",
    "Or, if you prefer a test drive, you can download the epilogue to Goodbye, Asshat for the low, low price of FREE.",
    "Get them all, including the finale, Goodbye, Asshat: 101 Farewell Letters to Donald Trump, at this link.",
    "x\n“You know, they say about America…diversity is our strength…and I look at China and I look at Russia.",
    "It’s past time we hang those moldering albatrosses around their treacherous necks, don’t you think?",

    "He also managed to slip in some Putin praise at the AFPAC as Greene awaited her turn to speak.",
    "Remember, this came shortly after Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.",
    "The tape was intended to go to other groups as a general “welcome video,\" he added.",
    "x\nx\nx\nAnd Fuentes isn’t just content to marginalize the vast majority of humans.",
    "FUENTES: “You know they say about America, they say diversity is our strength.",
    "The viral letter that launched four hilarious Trump-trolling books.",
    "Yes, the GOP is indeed the party of Putin and white nationalism.",
