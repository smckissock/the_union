Steve King had his committee assignments stripped by Republican leadership, of which McCarthy was the head, for saying, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization—how did that language become offensive?” In 2021, McCarthy declined to act against Gosar for appearing at a white nationalist event or posting assassination fantasies, or against Greene for conspiracy theories and assassination fantasies.",
