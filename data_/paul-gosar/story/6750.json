    "He then took a stand for personal medical freedom saying, “We should not treat people unfairly who want to allow their own immune system to take care of the situation.”\nThe interviewer then asked Maher about COVID patron saint Dr. Fauci, “Listening to you, it sounds like you really don’t think Dr. Anthony Fauci or the medical establishment really know what they are doing, that this is more whack-a-mole?”\n“They don’t know a lot about anything,” Maher responded, adding that while we’ve come a long way from “putting wooden teeth in our mouth like in the George Washington era… in general, we still don’t understand too much about how the human body works.”\n“So, don’t sit there in your white coat and tell me, ‘Just do what we say.",
