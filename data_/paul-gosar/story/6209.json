    "(@StaarVellocet) March 18, 2021\nOne of the tweets that theorized that the video showed Weber waving from the Capitol window received quite a bit of engagement:\nTexas Republican Rep Randy Weber waving through window at Capitol to the seditionists on Jan 6th\n— Sharon – My Vote.My Voice (@Midwest_Voter) June 19, 2021\nFinding the Answer\nAfter more than a year of theorizing, the case was finally solved by Twitter user and “sedition hunter” @K2theSky.",
    "@maddow @RonanFarrow @jaketapper\nFrom https://t.co/M3COhG2oTx pic.twitter.com/AN2VMwNxB4\n— Heather Bucha Whaley (@HeatherWhaley) January 22, 2021\nSome Twitter users theorized that the video showed Gosar being yanked away from the window by fellow Republican Rep. Mo Brooks, who also had said he believed the debunked conspiracy theory that there was widespread voter fraud in the election:\nSomebody pulled him from the window and possible cameras.",
    "One of the most mentioned theories was that the video showed Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican who had made the false claim that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election:\nNow that he’s getting more public scrutiny, it’s a good day to revisit this video of Paul Gosar waving from a Capitol building window on #Jan6 https://t.co/7bb3HnZbbe\n— True Blue American Woman ?????",
    "But, here I am, basically trapped in the Senate radio and TV gallery.”\nThe video even included a glimpse of the empty U.S. Senate floor:\nIn sum, the man in the video who was waving from the Capitol window on Jan. 6 was Agnew, a journalist, and was not Gosar, Biggs, Weber, or another Republican politician, as previously theorized.",
    "Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar Add Fuel, but No Evidence, to Baseless Election-Fraud Claims.” Arizona Republic, 10 Nov. 2020, https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/11/10/andy-biggs-paul-gosar-add-fuel-baseless-election-fraud-claims/6243784002/.",
    "We reached out to Agnew to learn more about what he remembered from that day, including asking him what happened that caused him to jolt backward and away from the window, and will update this story if we receive a response.",
    "On Jan. 6, Agnew was a U.S. Senate correspondent for Salem Radio Network news:\nLooks like the Senate Wing window waver was\nBob Agnew working as a U.S. Senate Correspondent for Salem Communications\nbob.agnew.33 on FB.",
    "Ever since the U.S. Capitol riot in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, online sleuths have looked for answers about a specific video of a man waving at protesters from one of the windows of the Capitol building.",
    "According to all of the videos on his profile from that day, he spent time looking out of the Capitol window while narrating that he was waving at people who were waving and making “menacing signs” at him.",
    "Both men also said they believed in the false notion that there was massive and widespread election fraud:\nI still wanna know who this was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 watching from this window.",
    "The man who was waving wore a dress shirt and tie, leading many to believe he might have been a Republican politician who was sympathetic to supporters of then-U.S. President Donald Trump.",
    "(@wiseoldwoman) November 17, 2021\nRep. Gosar\nOne of the clips that was most scrutinized showed the man who was waving suddenly moving away from the Capitol window:\nWhat’s going on here?",
    "— Jaime (@KansasResisters) March 20, 2021\n“This Jan. 6 video needs to be investigated,” one popular tweet with thousands of engagements read.",
    "That is Paul Gosar/Arizona waving and my bet it is Mo Brooks or one of the other sedition House reps that pulled him from the window.",
    "In a tweet, @K2theSky said it wasn’t Gosar, Biggs, or Weber waving from the Capitol window, nor was it any other politician.",
    "In the clips, he was simply following directions from law enforcement to stay put in a specific area of the building.",
    "“There you see some supporters down there [for President Trump],” Agnew said in one of the videos.",
    "(@K2theSky) January 24, 2022\nAccording to videos on Agnew’s own Facebook profile, this was true.",
    "Reps. Biggs and Weber\nOthers believed the video showed Reps. Andy Biggs or Randy Weber.",
    "They think I’m a member of, I don’t know, whatever part of the press they don’t like.",
    "One clip showed that his face, dress shirt, and tie all matched the other video.",

    "Someone inside Capitol waving to a friend as windows are being kicked in.",
    "Instead, it simply showed a journalist named Bob Agnew.",
