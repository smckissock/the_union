    "— “Writing for the court majority, Chief Justice Steven González said the GMA’s efforts to conceal the identity of corporations bankrolling its 2013 campaign ‘struck at the core of open and transparent elections.’” The trade group “spent more than $11 million to defeat Initiative 522, which would have required labeling of genetically modified food products.",

    "While clients were eager to get in on the Covid relief bill, infrastructure bill or thus-far-failed Build Back Better package — or to beat back increased taxes or other penalties in either of those bills — “by about the middle of the year, I think you're likely to see a lot less activity,” Lampkin said.",

    "— The passage of yet another coronavirus relief package in the spring and the bipartisan infrastructure bill in the fall, along with the on-again-off-again negotiations on another $1 trillion-plus social spending and climate package, drove new clients and new industries into lobbyists’ arms.",
    "Pomper said Akin Gump expects to see a focus on health care in 2022, “with an intense focus on the reauthorization of user fee programs for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.”\n— Karishma Page, a partner at K&L Gates, acknowledged that lobbyists’ work is often cyclical.",
    "The lobbyist noted that such a viewpoint is not universally shared, causing a disagreement ‘that’s stunting the legalization effort.’”\n— And “even as cannabis has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry, there hasn’t been a corresponding increase in federal lobbying expenditures.",
