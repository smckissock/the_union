    "He heaped praise onto both of them, calling Warren “just a luminary in the Democratic Party” and said he admires Peters for “not only his politics, but just how he makes it work in a state like Michigan.”\nHe declined to talk about how the DSCC handled his 2016 run: “I don’t want to look back on anything like that.” Instead Fetterman said he wants to emphasize that he’s a “good Democrat that is always going to be there to help the party meet the moment to deliver the Biden agenda.”\nThe hulking, 6-foot-8 Fetterman dresses casually as he fights for marijuana legalization, a $15 minimum wage and transgender rights.",
    "Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) this week said Fetterman is “the kind of populist that I think would do very well in Pennsylvania.”\nRepublicans argue that Fetterman is too liberal to win this fall’s general election against the winner of a GOP field that includes business executive David McCormick and TV surgeon Mehmet Oz.",
    "I guess he fits the bill.”\nThough Fetterman wants to scrap the filibuster (and Lamb followed him to that position last year), it might not be in the cards even if he wins, particularly if Democrats lose control of either chamber of Congress this fall.",
    "Democrats’ decision to forgo endorsing the more moderate Lamb, who holds a tough seat for Democrats in Western Pennsylvania, is an evolution for a party that’s spent years playing kingmaker among its Senate candidates — sometimes with poor results.",
    "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who is frequently targeted by Fetterman for standing in the way of filibuster reform and Biden’s agenda, said that Lamb would “be an outstanding U.S. senator.”\n“Haven’t met the guy,” Manchin said of Fetterman.",
    "Warren’s response to that line: “Oh, I’m sorry, what I want is advice from Republicans on who should be the Democratic nominee.”\nPeters said that “any time I hear Republicans underestimating a candidate, it brings a smile to my face.",
    "And certainly that’s what we have in Pennsylvania, particularly with the top two candidates.”\nFetterman described his campaign’s relationship with the DSCC this time around as “good” and said he has spoken with Peters and Warren.",
    "raised the ad during a Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday, and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Gary Peters said they were addressing the issue, according to several attendees.",
    "In fact, party leaders on Tuesday heard private concerns about a pro-Lamb super PAC after the group slammed Fetterman as a “self-described Democratic socialist,” a claim that led to the ad being pulled from one TV station.",
    "Yet asked if he’d be comfortable with Fetterman as the nominee, Peters replied confidently: “I would be, certainly.”\n“If I have candidates that can win the general election, we’re not going to put our thumb on the scale.",
    "Almost everyone in the Democratic caucus is staying neutral in the Pennsylvania primary, but there’s plenty of warmth for Fetterman and few concerns that he’d be a weaker general election candidate than his rivals.",
    "Now with the 50-50 Senate majority on a knife’s edge, Democrats are trusting primary voters to give them the best candidates rather than weighing in from D.C. in contested primaries in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",
    "“There’s a long history of hand-picked Democratic candidates doing very badly in the general election.”\nThere’s almost no sign that Democrats are worried enough about Fetterman to intervene in the primary.",
    "But the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party is not likely to prevail in a general election,” said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), whose retirement is sparking the open race, of Fetterman’s prospects.",

    "The filibuster-hating, gym-shorts-wearing progressive lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic nomination in one of the country’s most important Senate races.",
    "Top DSCC aides have expressed displeasure with the prospect of attack ads in the primary during recent conversations with outside Democrats, according to two people familiar with the discussions.",
    "That’s a 180-degree turn from the state’s last open primary, when party bosses endorsed and spent big for establishment favorite Katie McGinty, while Fetterman came in third.",
    "| Keith Srakocic/AP Photo\nBy Burgess Everett and Holly Otterbein\n 04/06/2022 06:14 PM EDT\nDemocrats barely even noticed John Fetterman was running for Senate in 2016.",
    "“You’re never going to pick up your smartphone or the paper and find that John Fetterman has changed his mind on minimum wage or voting rights or the PRO Act.”",
    "Because I’ve been in that seat before.”\nThat’s not to say there aren’t some in the caucus who would prefer Lamb, even if they aren’t officially endorsing him.",

    "But there is still some concern that the increasingly bitter contest between Fetterman, Lamb and Kenyatta could damage the party’s nominee.",
    "And if Conor Lamb wants to stand up as a Democrat, then he needs to disavow that ad today,” Warren said in an interview on Wednesday.",

    "), then the DSCC chief, recalled this week that he didn’t look closely at the Fetterman campaign.",
    "And successful in his own way.” Put plainly, this is not your typical Democratic frontrunner.",
    "Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) described Fetterman as “an unusual candidate.",
    "“I keep saying, you know, to get rid of the filibuster, just elect more liberals.",
    "“We are 100 percent behind the Biden agenda and the Democratic agenda,” he said.",
