    "Blood sport, it may be, as just this week, Dr. Mehmet Oz, another Republican running for the Senate, quipped that Mr. McCormick “says he is tough on China, but got rich investing with them.”\nThe New York Times reported late last month that Mr. McCormick’s hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, was closely linked to China, and cited affectionate comments he had made in the past about the country, though some were from when he served as U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs in George W. Bush’s administration.",
    "“That doesn’t mean we have to send our soldiers to protect it, but we should stand tall for freedom.”\nThe rest of Mr. McCormick’s appearance Thursday was an elevator pitch on how he was motivated to run for the Senate by the messy Afghanistan withdrawal, rising inflation and a desire to push back on “weakness and wokeness.”\nAsked what he would do if President Joe Biden nominated a Supreme Court justice in the last two years of his term, Mr. McCormick said he’d “block it.",
    "At a meet-and-greet event at Atria’s Restaurant, the 56-year-old outlined a policy platform on China that includes continuing the Trump tariffs on steel and letting victims of COVID-19 sue the Chinese government, in what’s an overall effort to “get to the bottom of” the virus’ roots.",
    "He also talked of the need to hold China accountable for the “bad things it’s done,” including its treatment of Uighurs in the region and its role in fentanyl flowing into the U.S.\n“We need to speak loudly and clearly — that we project freedom around the world,” Mr. McCormick said.",
    "Mr. McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO who’s running in the Republican primary, repeatedly insisted that he’s taken a hawkish approach to relations with China, and that — like former President Donald Trump — he’s embracing his business record, not running away from it.",
    "His business history with China under a microscope, U.S. Senate candidate David McCormick punched back Thursday in a visit to Peters, saying he’d “lead the fight” and advocate for a “whole-of-nation strategy” to get tougher on the global superpower.",
    "“They were just different communists.”\nMr. McCormick framed the attacks against his record as politics as “blood sport,” and said he thinks Pennsylvanians are smart enough to know that he would be tough on China.",
    "Mr. McCormick said if he’s elected, he would work to “decouple” U.S. supply chains from China so America would be less dependent on the country for pharmaceuticals and semi-conductors.",
    "“I’m going to make the case to the people of Pennsylvania that I am the best guy, the best person in the state, of the best people in the country to lead that charge.",
    "I’ve spent nine years of my life thinking about how to fight the communists,” said Mr. McCormick, an Army veteran who fought in the Gulf War.",
    "I’d fight it.” He said he’ll “stand strong for justices who follow the Constitution.”\nFirst Published March 3, 2022, 2:52pm",
    "It’s time to “bring those home,” he told the crowd.",
    "I’m a combat veteran."
