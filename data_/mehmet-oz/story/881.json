    "Will the backlash that I watched last night, stick with Trump long-term and carry over with people tuning him out and not listening to other endorsements he makes?",
    "So that he came out as soon as this news broke, along with many others who I would call die-hard Trump supporters who had the same reaction, it made me ponder.",
    "I have no idea if this is part of the formulation of why Trump endorsed someone like Oz that his base does not like but it is also something worth pondering.",
    "That many comments that I read yesterday comparing Oz to Utah senator Mitt Romney could be spot-on is another reason why this backlash occurred last night.",
