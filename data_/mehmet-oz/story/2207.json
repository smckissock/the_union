    "Lamb won a big upset victory in a 2018 congressional election during which his opponent sneered that Lamb was “someone who’s young and idealistic, who still hopes he can change the world.” Which, at the time, I felt might go down as the most depressing political attack in modern history.",

    "Now really, if you were one of the many donors who sent in a contribution hoping for that one-on-one, do you feel:\nA.",
    "That’s Rudy Giuliani’s latest Trump story, and I can’t summon the energy to wonder whether it actually happened.",
