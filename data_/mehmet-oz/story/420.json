    "— Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) April 10, 2022\nThis endorsement could divide MAGA in the only way that matters: he could lose America First conservatives over it https://t.co/UC22IlLdFy\n— Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) April 10, 2022\nThe problem is Oz hasn't always been a doctrinaire conservative.",
    "He has likely learned the same lesson Trump did: You don't need to be a lifelong conservative so long as you fight relentlessly for guns and against abortion and immigration once you enter the political arena.",
    "Over the weekend, former President Donald Trump endorsed Mehmet Oz — \"Dr. Oz\" to the many viewers of his longtime syndicated television show — in the Pennsylvania GOP primary for U.S. Senate.",
    "A series of newspaper columns written under his byline advocated gun control measures; he used to be pro-choice; and his show once sympathetically featured transgender kids.",
    "And if you lump all three qualities together —deservedly or not — then being famous on TV understandably becomes a natural foundation for serving in the U.S. Senate.",
    "I think you often got a raw deal and I wrote a book about it.And I think you are screwing up badly right now.Find somebody who’s willing to tell you you’re wrong.",
    "He once touted gun control and pro-choices stances before he realized appealing exclusively to the Rush Limbaugh-Fox News audience was his surest route to power.",
    "\"I have known Dr. Oz for many years, as have many others, even if only through his very successful television show,\" Trump said in his endorsement.",
    "He was a TV addict during his White House years, spending more time and focus watching cable news than he did on his intelligence briefings.",
    "He famously picked cabinet members based on their physical bearing and whether they appeared to be straight out of \"central casting.\"",
    "From an ideological standpoint, that makes Trump occasionally unreliable for the conservatives who usually cheer him the loudest.",
    "Oz hasn't always been respected or considered smart, but it's not clear Trump understands there's a difference.",
    "Everybody knows about the reality show, but his love of television and TV cameras followed him into politics.",
    "He's flipped on guns and abortion, at least, but all of those old stances are no-gos for the MAGA right.",
    "John Bolton got his job as Trump's national security adviser because the president saw him on Fox News.",
    "\"He has lived with us through the screen and has always been popular, respected, and smart.\"",
    "Fame is the foundation of Trump's power, and it probably will end up the same for Oz.",
    "I like you, Donald.I think you were a terrific president fighting against great odds.",
    "Trump's most-devoted right-wing fans rebelled angrily against his pick.",
    "Trump's real ideology — aside from his uncut narcissism — is fame.",
    "And TV was the reason he picked Oz to endorse in Pennsylvania.",
    "Trump's fans probably shouldn't worry about Oz, however.",
    "He's a Republican mostly because it's convenient.",
    "But Trump has never really been an ideologue.",
    "This probably isn't a shock.",
    "Ideas can always come later.",
    "More surprising?",
    "Popular, maybe."
