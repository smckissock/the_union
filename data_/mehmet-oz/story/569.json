    "Fetterman might be able to win back some rural white worker support, but he’s really Bernie Sanders, something that Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel thought to remind us of a few days ago:\nThe liberal is 6-foot-8, has a goatee and tattoos, and revels in gym shorts, Carhartt and blue-collar Keystone culture.",
    "And yes, not all Democrats like him (via Politico):\nFetterman’s fans think his brand of economic progressivism and his Carhartt-wearing linebacker vibe make him uniquely able to win elections in the kinds of Rust Belt and white working-class areas where Democrats have been hemorrhaging support.",
    "Mr. Lamb is openly campaigning on these Fetterman liabilities, and a super PAC supporting Mr. Lamb last month circulated polling data showing a precipitous drop in Mr. Fetterman’s support when respondents were presented with his agenda and record.",

    "They want to see how the chips fall, and by that—I mean progressives don’t want the DC crew to derail Fetterman’s candidacy, even though he holds a commanding lead in the primary.",
    "State Democrats also worry the Fetterman pitch to Trumpian voters and the 2013 incident will turn off the urban minority and affluent suburban voters Democrats depend on.",
    "I’ll pull up a seat, and probably disagree with 85-90 percent of what he or she has to say, but at least I know this person isn’t a pile of hot woke garbage.",
    "Perhaps a greater political problem in today’s environment, he’s spoken at defund-the-police rallies and made a priority of releasing felons from prison.",
    "They argue he’s a loner who doesn’t spend any time trying to build alliances with other pols—and that as a result he’ll be less effective in office.",
    "Some take issue with his politics: Moderates think his deep commitment to getting repentant convicts out of life sentences is too radical.",
    "While Mr. Fetterman grew up in Central Pennsylvania in affluence, he presents himself as the patron saint of the Rust Belt Working Joe.",
