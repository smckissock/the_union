    "This Doctor is in, are you?”\nAnd this past weekend, Oz again tried to grasp at straws of relevancy by re-sharing the video and adding: “I challenged Dr. Fauci to a debate 44 days ago, and still haven’t heard a thing from him… [cricket emoji]”\nHe probably wasn’t hoping for responses like these, which have flooded the post:\nWhy would one of the world’s foremost epidemiologists debate a man who was once a cardiologist, who now sells fake supplements to the unsuspecting public?",
    "— Gary R. Blockus (@gblockus) February 27, 2022\nMore than half of Dr. Oz’s recommendations on medical talk series — including The Dr. Oz Show — had either no evidence or actually went against medical research, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal.",
    "https://t.co/0MwXJCQ9Co\n— taraander (@taraander) February 26, 2022\nDr Fauci is an American physician-scientist and immunologist serving as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Chief Medical Advisor to the President.",
    "(@lcfairbairn) February 27, 2022\nBecause he’s working….and you don’t matter\n— Scott Nevins (@ScottNevins) February 27, 2022\nDr Fauci is a serious physician-scientist and immunologist who genuinely cares about the wellbeing of the American people.",
    "Related: Dr. Oz’s campaign for U.S. Senate is a sh*tshow of epic proportions, insiders say\nIn a GOP straw poll last month, Oz received just one–yes, ONE–vote out of more than 100 cast, despite spending $5.4 million on TV ads.",
    "But that hasn’t stopped Oz from pretending like it’s totally normal for an underperforming Senate primary candidate to debate the nation’s leading infectious disease expert on the national stage.",
    "Fauci, who is currently the Director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is most certainly not a candidate for one of Pennsylvania’s two senate seats.",
    "The TV doctor, who lives in New Jersey but is running for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, has again taken to social media to challenge Dr. Anthony Fauci to a public debate.",
    "?Randi Mayem Singer (@rmayemsinger) February 27, 2022\nI challenged Stephen Hawking to a debate about physics weeks ago and still haven’t heard from him.",
    "— Nathan Boonstra, MD (@PedsGeekMD) February 27, 2022\nMaybe because he’s a real doctor and a little too busy to date a talk show host hack stooge.",
    "(@maddenifico) February 28, 2022\nIt’s been three months since I asked your campaign for an interview, but I still haven’t heard a thing from you.",
    "You, on the other hand, are a quack who without the help of Oprah Winfrey, would be selling used colostomy bags from the back of a Ford Pinto.",
    "And for someone who keeps dodging debates in Pennsylvania, this is quite the hypocritical statement here, isn’t it?",
    "— factsVfake?#VetsResistSupportSquadron (@RealFactsVsFake) February 27, 2022\nHe’s not running against you.",
    "Still, he released this challenge to Fauci: “It’s past time Fauci faces the fact that he got COVID wrong.",
    "(@CRose2u) February 28, 2022\nRemember when you said it was okay for 2-3% of school children to die?",
    "Imagine all the nonsense this professional and dignified man has had to deal with ??????????",
    "And by your lane, I don’t mean running for a seat in a state you don’t live in.",
    "(@V_G_Plus) February 27, 2022\nYou… do know he’s not running against you, right?",
    "In two other straw polls, he placed third in one and fourth in the other.",
    "— Victoria Brownworth (@VABVOX) February 28, 2022\nGod I love Dr Fauci.",
    "— Paul ‘There Will Be Sarcasm’ Wiley (@WileyPaul) February 27, 2022",
