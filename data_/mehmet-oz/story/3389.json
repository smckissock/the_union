    "Oz shot back that McCormick's attacks against him “as the child of immigrants are reminiscent of slurs made in the past about Catholics and Jews.”\nMcCormick's campaign said Oz should renounce his dual citizenship right away, and contended that painting McCormick as a bigot for raising “valid national security concerns is a page right out of the liberal playbook.”",

    "“I was born in America, I’m a proud participant in American society, I’ve given up everything to run because I love this country so much,” Oz said.",
