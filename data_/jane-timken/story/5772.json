    "According to the Daily Beast, Republicans opposed to Mandel’s candidacy have filled the mad MAGA king’s head with twisted rumors about Mandel, which Trump has repeated to others “often in disgust.”\nIn recent months, these sources said, the onetime leader of the free world has even spent an inordinate amount of time gossiping with a large array of advisers and close associates about unconfirmed details of Mandel’s sex life.",

    "“I look forward to doing whatever I can to help elect Josh to the U.S. Senate,” Ilana Mandel said in a statement provided by the campaign.",
    "Mandel and his wife Ilana separated in 2020, presumably amicably, but they asked a judge to keep the details of their divorce secret.",
    "No details were given about what Trump finds so creepy about Mandel’s alleged sex life, so you don’t have to gouge out your eyes.",
    "Former President Oompa Loompa thinks Mandel doesn't have the right “visuals” or “look,” and would come across poorly on TV.",
