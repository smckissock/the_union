    "In a midterm election year with an unpopular president in which Republicans are poised to make widespread gains, Republicans, he said, “could easily miss the opportunity.”\n“This is going to be a big year for Republicans, and the only way it won’t be is if we nominate candidates who are looking back, not forward,” he said.",
