    "All Democrats, all Americans, should be concerned about this and what it could do to the 2024 presidential election.”\nThe Guardian noted in January that Finchem’s campaign raised $660,000 in 2021, nearly triple the amount brought in by Bolding's.",
    "Given his track record of doing whatever it took to appease Trump, “would he be willing and able to overturn the result of the 2024 presidential election in Arizona, potentially paving the way for a political coup?” The Guardian asks.",

    "The lawmaker from Tuscon is a deeply loyal supporter of former President Donald Trump and his lies about the 2020 election having been stolen.",
    "Finchem pushed baseless and mathematically impossible claims that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally for President Joe Biden.",
    "“That should terrify not just Arizona, but the entire nation.”\nHe added that “the public, in general, may not understand what’s at stake here.",
    "And he is running as his party’s candidate for Arizona secretary of state, a position that controls how elections are conducted in his state.",
    "“Someone who wants to dismantle, disrupt and completely destroy democracy is running to be our state’s top election officer,” said Bolding.",
    "“The role of secretary of state is critical to the smooth workings and integrity of elections in many states, Arizona included.",
    "“That’s a danger, as it gives Finchem a realistic path in which he could win – and Finchem will do what Trump wants.”",
    "In short, they are in charge of conducting and counting the vote,” The Guardian explained in a report on Monday.",
    "Finchem entered the race last fall and was quickly endorsed by Trump.",
