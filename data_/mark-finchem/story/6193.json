    "Conservative “superstars” such as Lt. General Michael Flynn, former national security advisor to President Donald Trump and retired chief of military intelligence; conservative rock star Ted Nugent; Colonel Allen West, former congressman and Texas GOP chief; libertarian business magnate and Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne; former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Tom Hohman; former Customs and Border Protection head Mark Morgan; celebrity actress and author Sam Sorbo; Arizona State Representative Mark Finchem; many sheriffs and lawmen; and leading conservative media personalities.",
    "“The Payne arena’s vendor Ticketmaster posted our event was cancelled and refused to pull it down, the Payne arena would not advertise it like they normally do with other events, and the Hidalgo City Manager called Eric, the manager of the arena, and said the event was cancelled, that he didn’t want a Trump event in his town.”\nWhile the Payne Arena, where the event was held, did allow Saturday’s events to proceed, they denied the group access to the premises for Sunday’s portion of the conference.",
    "“We wanted to bring to the attention of the American populace how we the people can step in and take control where our ‘governmental leaders’ have failed us so terribly and where they continue to break the laws of the United States.”\n“The event focused on domestic security, human trafficking, drug trafficking and the impact it is having on our communities as well as the humanitarian crisis this administration’s policies have created,” she continued.",
    "“We will not sit by while those that seek to fundamentally transform America into a socialist communist society demean and destroy our traditional family values nor destroy the fabric of our Constitution.”\nThat cartels, government officials, fake-news purveyors, and Big Tech companies were able to shut down and silence this event so effectively should terrify Americans of all political persuasions and freedom lovers everywhere.",
    "And by the time the first day of the event was over, the establishment media had painted the event as an alleged security threat that law enforcement was supposedly “monitoring.” No mention was made in key media reports about the fact that attendees and speakers in many cases were lawmen themselves or even top-level former federal officials who barely a year earlier were running huge security agencies.",
    "Colonel Allen West, meanwhile, who is running for Texas governor after having served in Congress and as leader of the Texas GOP, warned that states must tackle the crisis before it is too late, adding that “every state is now a border state.”\nIt was obvious to everyone involved that the Biden administration, the drug cartels, and the radical left all had an incentive to sabotage the historic event.",
    "Indeed, the leftist-controlled National Butterfly Center on the U.S.-Mexico border, which fought the border wall and has been raising suspicions among border-security advocates for years over its alleged role in facilitating illegal border crossing, put out a statement announcing that it was closing for the weekend due to supposed concerns over the safety of its staff.",
    "Despite no evidence to back up the claims, far-left activists and their allies in the establishment media have repeatedly smeared her as a supporter of “Q-Anon,” a “religious zealot,” and even a “white supremacist.” Hutcherson also slammed the false accusation made against her organization regarding alleged threats to the Butterfly Center.",
    "“Our weekend ended with a prayer march to the wall to pray over our nation and to lock arms in solidarity to say, ‘No more not on our watch’!”\nIn fact, Hutcherson and others involved with the event believe that part of the reason for the unprecedented sabotage against the events was that it would shed light on what was going on.",
    "The leader, Marianna Treviño-Wright, has been telling every left-wing media outlet that will listen that she supposedly lives in perpetual fear of “stochastic terrorism” from conservatives who believe “lies” about illegal border crossings, sex trafficking, and other alleged criminal activity taking place at the preserve.",
    "U.S. Border Patrol veteran of 28 years Frank Lopez, who is now running for Congress, explained to The New American that the Biden administration has taken over a military runway near the border and is now packing 737s full of illegal immigrants and then flying them to various destinations across the nation.",
    "Morgan and former head of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Tom Homan, who together served under six administrations, said it was critical to understand why some three to four million illegal border crossings have been facilitated by the administration’s policies over the last year.",
    "The Butterfly Center itself put out a statement saying the We Stand America event organized by “Trump operatives” would be similar to one organized by Steve Bannon and others “that likely incited the Wal-mart Massacre in El Paso.”\nOf course, the accusation was self-evidently ludicrous.",

    "But for reasons that have not been properly explained, Ticketmaster refunded everybody’s money and told ticket holders that the event had been canceled.",
