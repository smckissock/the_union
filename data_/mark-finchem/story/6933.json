    "As Politico notes, far from making him a fringe outsider in the Republican party, it’s effectively overtaken the GOP, as the majority of Republican officials remain terrified to cross him by saying something controversial like “Actually, JFK Jr. is dead” or “You lost the election.” Making it clear that he is one of them, the ex-president spent Saturday night throwing all kinds of conspiracy-theory catnip to the base, including a favorite one about the January 6 rioters actually being government informants.",
    "Trump, of course, does virtually nothing to push back on these deranged claims, which should not come as a surprise given his promotion of the birther movement during the Obama years and, for example, his suggestion during the 2020 election that it was entirely possible Democrats were running a Satanic pedophile cult.",
    "“Why aren’t they looking at that, and there’s massive evidence that shows exactly what I’m talking about.” He also claimed—falsely, of course—that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had blocked the National Guard from entering the Capitol to stop the riots on January 6, which rallygoers naturally ate up.",

    "He was not alone among the crowd in believing that JFK Jr. is not only still alive but is also a secret Trump supporter embedded far in the “deep state.” One attendee was spotted wearing a red shirt with the faces of Trump, Kennedy and Kennedy Jr. in the crowd.",
    "“Why don’t they talk about the guy that killed that girl Ashli Babbitt?” Cece Fager asked Politico, referencing the protester who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer while trying to break down a door that led to the House Speaker’s lobby.",
    "Another speaker was Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem, who is running to be Arizona’s secretary of state, has been linked to QAnon and has reportedly discussed conspiracies about a network of elected officials involved in a network of pedophilia.",

    "“Exactly how many of those present at the Capitol complex on January 6 were FBI confidential informants agents or otherwise working directly or indirectly with an agency of the United States government?",
    "Elsewhere were individuals in hats that read “Trump Won” and buttons with “Q.” Figures from fringe QAnon online groups, like Jim and Ron Watkins, shared their visit to the rally with online followers.",
    "We mean legitimately, thoroughly out of touch with reality in the sense that they believe JFK Jr.—the one who famously died in a plane crash in 1999—is (1) alive, and (2) secretly a big fan of Trump.",
    "But just so it’s clear, when we say Trump supporters are “batshit crazy,” we don’t mean it in the sense that everyone is a little crazy and life has a way of doing that to you.",
    "One of the introductory speakers, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who represents the district that includes Florence, invoked a “storm coming”—a phrase used by QAnon—in his speech.",
    "Ron DeSantis, to former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to onetime national security adviser turned ardent conspiracy theorist Mike Flynn—an unorthodox idea came to him.",
