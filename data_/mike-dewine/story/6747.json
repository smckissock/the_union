    "“Intel’s new facilities will be transformative for our state, creating thousands of good-paying jobs in Ohio manufacturing strategically vital semiconductors, often called ‘chips.’ Advanced manufacturing, research and development, and talent are part of Ohio’s DNA, and we are proud that chips — which power the future — will be made in Ohio, by Ohioans.”\nThirty-two years ago, the United States led worldwide chip production, but as years passed, production capacity dropped from around 40% to around 12% in 2020.",
    "According to DeWine's office, \"the confluence of geopolitical tensions and pandemic disruptions starkly exposed this danger to the U.S. economy: decades of offshoring the manufacturing of chips — a foundational technology that makes modern life possible — to Asia has stagnated innovation and left the U.S. vulnerable to supply chain disruptions that have crippled major sectors of our national and state economy, and harmed businesses and consumers.\"",
    "Chip technology is used in nearly all business sectors, including:\nAutomotive\nAdvanced mobility\nAerospace\nAviation\nConsumer goods\nData centers\nDefense\nHealthcare\nTechnology\n\"Just as candles gave way to light bulbs, carriages gave way to cars, and now engines to battery packs, we must continue to attract the businesses and jobs of the future to make sure Ohioans, their children, and their grandchildren can prosper here,” said Lt.",
    "“With the project announced today, we are establishing an entirely new industry sector that currently does not exist in our state, and along with it, we are rebuilding for America a sustainable, resilient domestic supply chain of semiconductors, which is critical to our national and economic security.\"",

    "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Intel will invest $20 billion in a new computer chip facility in Ohio amid a global shortage of microprocessors used in everything from phones and cars to video games.",
    "By having chip production here in Ohio, its helps not only the country's national security interests but its \"industrial competitiveness,\" DeWine's office said.",
