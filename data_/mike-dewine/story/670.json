    "“If you wait for the case to occur [in your school],” he told NPR, “you still have wound up closing the school, but now you’ve missed the opportunity to have the real benefit that would have accrued had you closed the school earlier.” He added, “It’s sort of closing the barn door after the cow is gone.”\nHe acknowledged that closing schools before anyone got sick would be “a very difficult thing to do,” but he said it is “probably extremely beneficial and much wiser.”\nHe went on a public relations tour to hand out his advice which he based on his own studies on influenza in schools — which spreads in a totally different manner than COVID-19 when it comes to children.",
    "“There is no clear evidence that [school closures] will slow this outbreak,” she wrote, saying, “If children don’t experience severe illness from or contribute to the spread of Covid-19 — and so far we have found no clear evidence that they do — it’s likely that school closings will have little effect on its spread.”\nShe also wrote: “Interruptions in education can profoundly harm child development and make it harder to reduce the achievement gap between high- and low-income families.”\nAnd Nuzzo’s perspective was one of many that warned at the time that the spread of COVID-19 would not be decreased by school closures and that children would be harmed by them.",
    "The paper also cited the Royal College of Pediatrics’ warning that keeping schools closed “risks scarring the life chances of a generation of young people.”\nPresident Joe Biden\nAfter Trump came out in favor of reopening schools, then-candidate Joe Biden blasted him, saying Trump “just wants schools to open because he’s afraid if they don’t, it will hurt his re-election chances.”\nBiden was perfectly happy to set aside the needs of children to take a shot at Trump and ingratiate himself with the left.",
    "CNN’s Maeve Reston, for instance, said, “His concern about safety does not apparently extend to schools.”\nPaymon Rouhanifard, a member of the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, described the left’s reaction in Time magazine:\nWhen President Trump came out in favor of opening schools in July with his usual ham-handed, irresponsible rhetoric, the left adopted a simple heuristic: if Trump is for it, then we must be against it.",
    "The foil to the CDC was the American Academy of Pediatrics, which strongly recommended in June 2020 that children be “physically present in school.”\nDr. Sean O’Leary, who specialized in pediatric infectious diseases and wrote the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidance, explained that schools were not contributing to the spread of COVID-19: “This virus is different from most of the respiratory viruses we deal with every year.",
    "That doesn’t seem to be the case with Covid-19.”\nHe added, “As pediatricians, many of us have recognized already the impact that having schools closed even for a couple months had on children.”\nThe Left-Wing Reactionary Bandwagon\nIn July 2020, President Donald Trump called for reopening schools, said the closings were a “terrible decision,” and threatened to cut funding if schools did not reopen.",
    "A study by three demographers at the University of Oxford published in April 2021 examining school closures in the Netherlands concluded: “?Students made little or no progress while learning from home.” Closing schools for eight weeks, the study found, caused students to have learning loss equivalent to one-fifth of a school year — the same period that schools were closed.",
    "Kacey Ernst of the University of Arizona, Karen Levy of Emory University, and Carlos del Rio of Emory University\nThese infectious disease experts published an open letter on March 15 which demanded “closing schools nationwide as soon as possible.” They sent it to Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",
    "We have a very large country, and the dynamics of the outbreak are different in different regions of the country, so I would imagine that situations regarding school will be very different in one region versus another.”\nBut in November of 2020, he changed his tune, saying, “Close the bars and keep the schools open,” in reference to New York City.",
    "Nicholas Christakis, Yale University Physician and Social Scientist\nIn early March of 2020, before DeWine made his fateful announcement, Yale professor Nicholas Christakis argued that it would be better to close schools before a single case of the virus was detected in students than to do so after the virus had infected students.",
    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued guidance March 14 essentially dismissing the efficacy of closures in slowing the spread of COVID-19:\nAvailable modeling data indicate that early, short to medium closures do not impact the epi curve of COVID-19 or available health care measures (e.g., hospitalizations).",

    "And if they’re masked, people are careful, we’ve demonstrated that the spread in schools is not great when kids are masked and we’ve also found out the difficulty that kids have when they’re not in school.”\nBut both of those facts were established at the time DeWine announced his closure.",
    "In an article for Forbes titled “The Ridiculousness Of Learning Loss,” Ewing wrote: “Learning loss is a calculation masquerading as a concept — a rather shallow, naïve, ridiculous concept.” Parents, his thinking went, had nothing to fear about their children getting behind.",
    "Levy said she was on a bike ride along Atlanta’s Beltline when she became upset that people were “hanging out and clearly had not gotten the memo.”\nLevy and her colleagues quickly recruited “more than 100 established infectious disease scientists” to sign their letter.",
