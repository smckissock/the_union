    "A panel of three federal judges overseeing separate litigation had weighed whether to postpone the election but had not done so as of Tuesday, when voters began casting ballots.",
    "The campaign has turned increasingly negative as most candidates have sought to ally themselves with former President Donald Trump, who has not endorsed anyone.",
    "DeWine is facing three Republican challengers: former U.S. Representative Jim Renacci, former state legislator Rod Hood and Joe Blystone, a farmer.",
    "The candidates selected in the May 3 primary will represent their parties in the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.",
