    "Ohio’s state legislative redistricting process thus far:\n– Missed deadline\n– Vote w/o bipartisan support\n– @OHSupremeCourt rejects gerrymandered maps\n– Vote w/o bipartisan support\n– Court rejects again\n– Missed deadline\n– Vote w/o bipartisan support\n– Court rejects a third time\n— Tyler Buchanan (@Tylerjoelb) March 17, 2022\nDemocratic state lawmakers criticized Republicans for trying to pass gerrymandered maps yet again.",
    "Now, it is up to the Republican Commissioners to work with us to adopt the fair maps Ohioans deserve.”\nThe most recent maps were adopted by the redistricting commission 4 to 3, with only Republicans voting for the map and one Republican joining the two Democrats in the group to vote against them.",
    "When the commission redrew the maps after they were rejected for the second time in February, the justices ruled that the maps gave unfair favor to Republicans, giving them 58 percent of seats when previous election data has shown that about 54 percent of Ohio voters preferred Republicans.",
    "“For a third time, the Supreme Court has ruled that the majority party is not above the law and cannot blatantly disregard the will of Ohio voters and the Ohio Constitution,” said Ohio House Minority Leader and Democratic redistricting commission member Allison Russo in a statement.",
    "The group was created in 2015 in a constitutional amendment approved by voters, in order to stamp out partisan bias in the map-drawing process, but Republicans have been able to commandeer the commission and create gerrymandered maps anyway.",
    "“The evidence shows that the individuals who controlled the map-drawing process exercised that control with the overriding intent to maintain as much of an advantage as possible for members of their political party,” the justices wrote.",
    "“Substantial and compelling evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the main goal of the individuals who drafted the second revised plan was to favor the Republican Party and disfavor the Democratic Party,” the majority wrote.",
    "Before you go — please read the important update below\nFor the last two decades, millions of readers have relied on Truthout to provide accurate, transparent journalism through moments of political and social crisis.",
    "“Resolving this self-created chaos thus depends not on the number of hands on the computer mouse but, rather, on the political will to honor the people’s call to end partisan gerrymandering,” the ruling reads.",
    "The Ohio Supreme Court has rejected Republican-drawn district maps in the state for the third time, sending the majority-Republican Ohio Redistricting Commission back to the drawing board yet again.",
    "But voting rights advocates said that the maps would have put a hard cap on the number of districts that Democrats could win, regardless of voter preferences in that election.",
    "Mike DeWine suggested that Republican and Democratic mapmakers “work together” on the fourth draft, which is theoretically the entire purpose of the redistricting commission.",
    "Democrats weren’t given a chance to contribute to the map-drawing or even review the maps when they were presented in February, justices said in their decision.",
    "“Democrats have a state legislative map proposal ready to go that is fair, constitutional, and closely reflects the statewide voting preferences of Ohioans.",
    "Over the last year, we’ve struggled to meet our basic operating costs, as Facebook and Google have reduced the visibility of non-corporate news stories.",
    "Republicans have already had their maps rejected by the court twice for gerrymandering, and the commission has missed numerous deadlines to pass maps.",
    "Under the newly rejected maps, Republicans would have gotten 54 percent of seats in the state, matching voter preferences on a surface level.",
    "The majority, including one conservative justice, said that Republicans have inflicted “chaos” on themselves in the map-drawing process.",
    "In a 4-3 decision, the judges found that the maps were unconstitutional and didn’t reflect the will of voters in the state.",
    "As a result, our stories are being seen by fewer people at a time when trustworthy journalism is so desperately needed.",
    "We’re working hard to mitigate these issues but we still have an immediate need for your help, especially right now.",
    "Uncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.",
    "We’ve been proud to remain donor-supported — not once accepting money from advertisers or corporate funders.",
    "Because they weren’t passed with a bipartisan majority, they would only have been in place for four years.",
    "At least part of the primary election set to take place on May 3 will almost certainly have to be delayed.",
    "The maps then would have created a 42 percent seat ceiling for Democrats, the justices found.",
    "Whether you’re able to make a $5 monthly donation, or give more — we need you, today.",
    "We have just 6 days left in our fundraiser and still need to raise $37,000.",
    "Any amount of support you can spare right now will go a very long way.",
    "Please, do what you can to help us get through this trying time.",
    "They directed the commission to turn in new maps by March 28.",
    "But now, we face an existential threat to our survival.",
    "On Thursday, GOP Gov.",
