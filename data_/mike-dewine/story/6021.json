    "Guns and ‘mobs’\nCurrent law gives local police the power to block the sale and transportation of firearms, ammunition, or dynamite in a cordoned off area when suppressing a “riot” or when there is “clear and present danger of a riot.”\nHouse Bill 325, which the committee sent to the full House for a vote, would declare firearm sales and transfers to be “life sustaining ‘essential’ businesses and services for the purposes or safety and security” during any “disaster, war, act of terrorism, riot, civil disorder, public health crisis, or emergency of whatever kind.” It also adds the term “mob” alongside “riot” in the statute.",
    "Meanwhile, lawmakers inched forward on a bill to relax penalties for people carrying concealed weapons in prohibited places, and another restricting how local police can limit firearms sales or transportations during a “riot.”\nOn Tuesday, the House Government Oversight Committee reviewed Senate Bill 215, which would allow anyone 21 and up to carry without a permit so long as they lawfully possess the gun in question.",

    "Democrats on the committee asked the lead sponsor, Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, about a section of the bill that removes a requirement that people stopped by police “promptly” notify officers they’re carrying a concealed weapon.",
    "The legislation would lead to fewer violations of concealed handgun regulations that lead to criminal prosecution or the revocation of a concealed carry permit, according to analysis from the Legislative Service Commission.",
    "Democrats asked about opposition to the idea expressed during earlier hearings from law enforcement officials including Hamilton County Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey and Fraternal Order of Police lobbyist Michael Wineman.",
    "The governor has declined to take a position on the bill in public statements but told the Buckeye Firearms Association in writing during the 2018 primary that he would support a constitutional carry bill.",

    "He also claimed that while individual law enforcement from “inner cities” might not support the bill, but those from “rural areas” would have different opinions.",
    "The state House is teeing up a final passage vote on legislation to remove training and background check requirements to carry a concealed firearm in Ohio.",

    "The bill would block any government body from prohibiting the sale or transfer of any firearm, ammunition, or deadly weapon.",
    "He noted the combustible combination of protesters, counter-protesters, “provocateurs,” and openly carried firearms.",
    "Johnson responded noting that the Buckeye Sheriff’s Association and state Highway Patrol have declined to weigh in.",
    "“Creating state law that prohibits the exercise of local law enforcement judgment would be disastrous,” he said.",
    "Current law requires Ohioans to undergo eight hours of training and a background check to obtain a CCW permit.",
    "Republicans in the House passed a near identical bill last year, rendering passage more likely than not.",
    "If a CCW license expires during an emergency, the legislation would extend the license.",
