Greg Nash-Pool/Getty Images </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Analysts are keeping their eyes most closely on Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and North Carolina. In recent assessments, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/politics/senate-race-rankings-may-elections/index.html\">CNN</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/04/11/1091483542/the-top-10-senate-races-that-are-most-likely-to-flip-to-the-other-party\">NPR</a> and <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-7-senate-races-that-will-likely-decide-control-of-the-chamber/\">FiveThirty Eight</a> have all said these Senate races as among the most likely to flip. Of those seats, four are held by Democrats.</p>\n<p>Overall, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-chances-beating-gop-control-congress-polls-1704524\">polling shows</a> Republicans are favored to perform well in the midterms. A CNN/SSRS Opinion Panel carried out from May 3 to 5 showed that 49 percent of registered voters said they'd vote for a generic Republican candidate if the election were held today. Just 42 percent said they'd cast ballots for generic Democratic candidates&mdash;giving the GOP a 7-point advantage. Meanwhile, the Real Clear Politics average of recent generic congressional ballot polls currently has the GOP in the lead by 1.9 percent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/pelosi-confident-democrats-will-maintain-house-midterms-without-trump-ballot-1627423\">Recent historical precedent also suggests</a> that one or both congressional chambers are likely to flip to Republican control. Last June, the University of Virginia's Center for Politics released an analysis of midterms going back to 1946. That report showed that the president's party has lost more than three Senate seats, on average, during the midterms. The biggest loss has been 13 seats, while the largest gain has been just four seats.</p>\n<p>Here's a closer look at the four races where Republicans appear to have the best shot at flipping the seat on November 8.</p>\n<h3><strong>Arizona</strong></h3>\n<p>Democratic Senator <a data-sys=\"1\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/mark-kelly\">Mark Kelly</a> <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/arizona-senator-kellys-future-line-yet-hes-against-censuring-kyrsten-sinema-1672968\">managed to flip</a> a red seat blue in a special election in 2020. The seat was previously held by Martha McSally, a Republican who was appointed to serve Arizona in the Senate until the special election for the remainder of deceased GOP Senator <a data-sys=\"1\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/john-mccain\">John McCain</a>'s term. Kelly won in that race by a margin of 2.4 percent, with the support of 51.2 percent of Arizona voters, compared with 48.8 percent that backed McSally.</p>\n<p>It's unclear whom Kelly will face off against in November. The leading GOP contenders are Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters. Recent polls show Masters in third place among the Republican contenders, with the primary set for August. Former President <a data-sys=\"1\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> formally endorsed Masters on Thursday shortly after this article initially published.</p>\n<p>The latest survey data from Blueprint Polling shows Kelly would perform well against any of the top three Republicans, however. He leads all three by margins ranging from 14 percent to 17 percent. But a Data for Progress poll in January, which surveyed Arizona's likely voters about a Kelly vs. Brnovich match, showed a much closer competition. The incumbent Democrat was supported by 47 percent, compared with the 49 percent who preferred the Republican challenger.</p>\n<p>The Data for Progress poll additionally showed that more likely voters viewed Kelly unfavorably than those who viewed him favorably. Nearly half, 49 percent, viewed the Democrat &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;very&quot; unfavorably, while just 46 percent viewed him &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;very&quot; favorably.</p>\n<h3><strong>Georgia</strong></h3>\n<p>The contest between Senator <a data-sys=\"1\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/raphael-warnock\">Raphael Warnock</a> and former football star Herschel Walker <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/herschel-walkers-chances-beating-raphael-warnock-according-polls-1710413\">is looking</a> to be one of the closest watched in the midterms. Neither Warnock nor former GOP Senator <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kelly-loeffler\">Kelly Loeffler</a> secured more than 50 percent of the vote in the 2020 general election. As a result, the race went to a runoff in January 2021, which the Democrat won with 51 percent of the vote, compared with Loeffler's 49 percent. Recent polls suggest a similarly close race is possible this November.</p>\n<p>The current Real Clear Politics average of Georgia polls shows Walker with a very narrow lead over Warnock. The conservative Republican has the support of about 47.3 percent of Georgians, compared with 46.8 percent who back the Democratic incumbent.</p>\n<p>However, the most recent poll included in the average shows Warnock with a notable lead over Walker. That survey, conducted by WXIA-TV/SurveyUSA from April 22 to 27, puts the Democrat at 50 percent, compared with his opponent's 45 percent. An April survey had nearly opposite results. That poll, carried out by <em>The Hill</em>/Emerson College from April 1 to 3, showed Walker at 49 percent, compared with Warnock's 45 percent&mdash;a lead of 4 points for the Republican.</p>\n<p>Walker <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/why-did-it-take-gop-so-long-panic-about-herschel-walker-1709248\">has been endorsed</a> by Trump as well as Senate Minority Leader <a data-sys=\"1\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/mitch-mcconnell\">Mitch McConnell</a>, a Kentucky Republican.</p>\n<h3><strong>Nevada</strong></h3>\n<p>Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto looks likely to face off against Trump-backed Republican former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Laxalt, who is also endorsed by McConnell, is <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/poll-laxalt-has-15-point-lead-over-brown-ahead-of-upcoming-gop-senate-primary\">double digits ahead</a> of his GOP primary rival, Sam Brown. The Republican candidate will be determined by voters on June 14.</p>\n<p>Recent survey results show mixed results for Cortez Masto's chances of maintaining her seat against Laxalt. An early April poll conducted by The Nevada Independent found the incumbent Democrat had a lead of 8 points among registered voters. She was supported by 43 percent, compared with 35 percent who backed Laxalt.</p>\n<p>But another early April poll, carried out for the <em>Reno Gazette-Journal</em> by Suffolk University, showed Laxalt ahead by 3 points. The Trump-backed Republican had the backing of 43 percent of likely voters, while Cortez Masto had the support of just 40 percent. Notably, Biden won Nevada with about 50 percent of the vote in 2020. He had a relatively narrow margin over Trump of less than 34,000 votes.</p>\n<h3><strong>New Hampshire</strong></h3>\n<p>Recent polls suggest that Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan may be in for a tough battle to maintain her seat against a Republican challenger. Her GOP opponent won't be officially determined until a September primary, but recent polling shows that retired Army Brigadier General Don Bolduc is well ahead of the other Republican contenders, although many GOP voters are undecided.</p>\n<p>Survey data published in April by the University of New Hampshire showed that Hassan's favorability rating was significantly underwater. More than half, 51 percent, of New Hampshire's likely voters viewed her unfavorably. Only 35 percent viewed her favorably. Meanwhile, the same survey found that Hassan would beat Bolduc by only 1 point. The Democratic senator was supported by 47 percent of likely voters, compared with 46 percent who backed the Republican hopeful.</p>\n<p>However, a previous poll conducted by Phillips Academy in April showed Hassan with a 15-point lead over Bolduc. The senator had the backing of 54 percent of registered voters, while the Republican was supported by just 39 percent. Notably, Hassan, while still in the lead, was only single digits ahead of several other GOP candidates.</p>\n<p><em>Updated June 2 at 3:32 p.m. ET: This article was updated to report that Trump endorsed Masters in Arizona shortly after initial publication.</em></p>","id":"ART41040598889","text":"As the midterms approach, Republicans feel emboldened by President Joe Biden's tanking approval rating and widespread criticism of the Democrats' leadership in Washington, D.C.—giving them hope they'll be able to flip the Senate back to GOP control in November.\nDemocrats currently hold the Senate with the slimmest possible majority. The legislative body has 50 Republican members and 48 Democrats, as well as two independents who caucus with their Democratic colleagues. With that even split, Vice President Kamala Harris, in her role as Senate president, can cast tie-breaking votes, which gives her party narrow control of the upper chamber of Congress.\nWhen voters go to the polls across the country in just over five months, 35 Senate seats will be up for grabs. Of these, 14 are held by Democrats and 21 are held by Republicans. With a zero margin of comfort, Democrats cannot lose even one seat and maintain their control of the Senate. At the same time, most of these seats are considered safe, as they are held by incumbents in states that largely vote for Democrats or Republicans, respectively.\nSeven seats are considered by analysts to be the most competitive in the 2022 election cycle, although some are more likely to flip than others. Notably, while Republicans may manage to win one or more of these races, Democrats could also pick up a seat or two held by a GOP lawmaker.\nAnalysts are keeping their eyes most closely on Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and North Carolina. In recent assessments, CNN, NPR and FiveThirty Eight have all said these Senate races as among the most likely to flip. Of those seats, four are held by Democrats.\nOverall, polling shows Republicans are favored to perform well in the midterms. A CNN/SSRS Opinion Panel carried out from May 3 to 5 showed that 49 percent of registered voters said they'd vote for a generic Republican candidate if the election were held today. Just 42 percent said they'd cast ballots for generic Democratic candidates—giving the GOP a 7-point advantage. Meanwhile, the Real Clear Politics average of recent generic congressional ballot polls currently has the GOP in the lead by 1.9 percent.\nRecent historical precedent also suggests that one or both congressional chambers are likely to flip to Republican control. Last June, the University of Virginia's Center for Politics released an analysis of midterms going back to 1946. That report showed that the president's party has lost more than three Senate seats, on average, during the midterms. The biggest loss has been 13 seats, while the largest gain has been just four seats.\nHere's a closer look at the four races where Republicans appear to have the best shot at flipping the seat on November 8.\nArizona\nDemocratic Senator Mark Kelly managed to flip a red seat blue in a special election in 2020.

The leading GOP contenders are Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters.

In some cases, super PACs are virtually entirely financed by the angel donor.\nThe vast majority of super PACs do not raise most of their money from a single source. The 2,163 super PACs tracked by OpenSecrets have raised over $1.1 billion and spent $232 million so far during the 2022 midterm elections.\nAngel donors poured $155 million into liberal super PACs and $118.8 million into conservative super PACs. An additional $5.8 million went to non-partisan super PACs.\nOpenSecrets’ analysis breaks down the biggest names and numbers so far this election cycle, but readers can browse the full dataset here.\nLiberal super PACs get a boost from their billionaire founders\nDemocratic mega-donor George Soros is currently the top individual super PAC donor for the 2022 midterm election. He has contributed $126 million of the $155 million angel donors have given to liberal super PACs so far this election cycle. Forbes estimates the founder of the hedge fund Soros Fund Management and the philanthropic Open Society Foundations is worth $8.6 billion.\nThe billionaire poured $125 million into launching his super PAC, Democracy PAC II, which contributes millions to other liberal super PACs like the Senate Majority PAC or the House Majority PAC rather than make ad buys itself.\nWhile Soros’ contribution dwarfs others made so far this cycle, a Soros spokesman told OpenSecrets that Democracy PAC II is not likely to spend all $125 million this cycle. While he could not provide an exact number, the spokesman said, “I would doubt it’s going to come out to the level of the last cycle.”\nDuring the 2020 election cycle, Soros and the original Democracy PAC raised and contributed $81.4 million to other super PACs. Senate Majority PAC received $11.5 million from Democracy PAC during the last general election, and Democracy PAC II has contributed $5 million to Senate Majority PAC so far this cycle.\nSoros also contributed $1 million to Color of Change PAC, the hybrid PAC arm of progressive racial justice group Color of Change. Color of Change PAC has raised $2.5 million so far this cycle.\nFellow New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg contributed $562,000 of the nearly $641,000 raised by his super PAC, Independence USA PAC.\nThe former mayor of New York, whose net worth Forbes estimates to be $82 billion, spent big during the 2020 election in which he failed to secure the Democratic presidential nomination. Bloomberg gave his own presidential campaign over $1 billion before he dropped out of the race in March 2020, and he contributed over $67.3 million to Independence USA PAC during the 2020 election cycle.\nBloomberg, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination during the 2020 election cycle, contributed $98 million to super PACs that cycle, which made him the second-largest individual donor. He is currently the 29th top individual donor, having contributed almost $1.6 million so far this cycle.\nMega-donors donate to super PACs supporting alleged abusers\nConservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein, the founder of the shipping and business supply company ULINE, has poured $31.6 million as an angel donor to four super PACs this cycle so far.\nUihlein is consistently a top individual donor, according to OpenSecrets data, with an estimated wealth of $4 billion. He contributed $65 million to super PACs during the 2020 election cycle, which made him the third largest donor.\nBoth Uihlein and Bernard Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot whose net worth is $5.6 billion, were angel donors for super PACs backing Missouri Senate candidate and former Gov. Eric Greitens (R). Uihlein donated all $2.5 million raised by Team PAC, and Marcus donated $1 million to the Missouri First Action. Both are single-candidate super PACs supporting Greitens.\nGreitens resigned as governor in 2018 following allegations of sexual misconduct. Greitens’ ex-wife, Sheena Greitens, also accused her ex-husband of emotional and physical abuse toward her and their children in an affidavit filed in March.\nBoth Uihlein and Marcus made these contributions before Sheena Greitens filed the statement.\nMarcus is the angel donor for not just one, but two super PACs supporting candidates with credible allegations of domestic violence against them. He also gave almost $1.8 million to 34N22 Inc, a single-candidate super PAC that spent $200,000 supporting former National Football League star Herschel Walker.\nUihlein also contributed $1 million to 34N22 Inc in March 2022.\nWalker told Axios in December that he was “accountable” for violent acts he committed against his ex-wife. He won the Georgia Senate GOP primary last Tuesday, and he will face off with Sen. Raphael Warnock (D–Ga.) in the November general election.\nNeither Uihlein nor Marcus responded to OpenSecrets’ requests for comment.\nConservative mega-donors pour money into super PACs\nThe CEO of Oracle, Lawrence Ellison, gave $20 million to the Opportunity Matters Fund. Bloomberg estimates Ellison’s net worth to be $90.6 billion.\nThe super PAC is aligned with Sen. Tim Scott (R–S.C.) and has raised $21.6 million so far during the 2022 midterms. Opportunity Matters Fund has poured $760,000 into outside spending to support Republican Congressional candidates in Texas, Ohio and Georgia.\nOpportunity Matters Fund spent $492,000 on video production, TV placement and direct mail supporting Wesley Hunt in the GOP primary in Texas’ 38th Congressional District — the most it spent on any candidate this election cycle. Hunt won the primary in March, as did Rep. Tony Gonzales (R–Texas), who enjoyed a $99,000 boost from the super PAC, in Texas’ 23rd Congressional District.\nEllison also gave $1 million to the Tennessee Conservatives PAC, a single-candidate super PAC that backed Morgan Ortagus in the state’s 5th Congressional District. The Republican Party of Tennessee removed Ortagus, a former State Department spokeswoman who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, and two other candidates from the ballot in April, as they had not met the party’s requirement to vote in three of the last four statewide primary elections.\nAs OpenSecrets previously reported, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel has poured $23.5 million into the Ohio and Arizona GOP primary races. With an estimated net worth of $7.6 billion, Thiel contributed $15 million to the Protect Ohio Values, the single-candidate super PAC that supported his former employee J.D. Vance in the Ohio Senate GOP primary.\nThiel also donated $13.5 million to Saving Arizona, the super PAC supporting another friend and former employee of Thiel’s, Blake Masters, who’s seeking to unseat Sen. Mark Kelly (D–Ariz.). Thiel kickstarted the super PAC with a $10 million donation in April 2021, and The Washington Post reported Thiel made another $3.5 million contribution after Vance’s GOP primary victory in early May.\nCitadel CEO Ken Griffin spent big in a contentious Pennsylvania Senate race that is currently in the process of a recount. As OpenSecrets previously reported, Griffin contributed over $7.5 million to Honor Pennsylvania, a super PAC supporting former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick in the Senate GOP primary held on May 17. Bloomberg estimates Griffin’s net worth is $29.4 billion.\nThe race between McCormick and celebrity doctor turned politician Mehmet Oz, the candidate Trump endorsed, recently went to a recount as less than 1,000 votes separated the two candidates.\nJeffrey Yass, co-founder and managing director of Susquehanna International Group with an estimated net worth of $12 billion, contributed $15 million to the conservative super PAC School Freedom Fund.\nAffiliated with the conservative Club for Growth, which endorses candidates on a range of issues, School Freedom Fund is “Empowering Parents Over Education Bureaucrats.”\nSome of this season’s most contentious primaries have attracted spending by the super PAC. School Freedom Fund spent a total of $250,000 in West Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District boosting Trump-endorsed Rep. Alex Mooney (R–W.Va.) to victory over Rep. David McKinley (R–W.Va.) in a battle between two incumbents.\nThe super PAC put another $1.5 million into the North Carolina Senate GOP primary. Pat McCrory, who the super PAC spent most of its money to undermine, lost to Ted Budd, who snagged a key endorsement from Trump. The super PAC also spent $665,000 supporting Rep. Mo Brooks (R–Ala.), who advanced to a runoff against Katie Britt in Alabama’s Senate GOP primary.\nSchool Freedom Fund spent almost $500,000 in Nevada’s upcoming Republican primary to boost Adam Laxalt, who also received endorsements from both Trump and the Club for Growth.\nYass contributed another $5 million to the Kentucky Freedom PAC, a super PAC supporting Sen. Rand Paul (R–Ky.). Paul won his GOP Senate primary race last Tuesday, and he will face Kentucky state Rep. Charles Booker, a Democrat, in the November general election.\nNonpartisan super PACs attract big-name donors\nYass also contributed $1 million to Term Limits Action, which has raised $2.3 million so far this election cycle. The nonpartisan super PAC, which aims to enact term limits for all elected officials, has not spent money to support or oppose any candidates as of May 31.\nA nonpartisan super PAC that supports veteran candidates, With Honor Fund, received $4 million from the Bezos family so far this cycle. With Honor Fund has raised $5.5 million, and as OpenSecrets previously reported, Jacklyn and Miguel Bezos, the parents of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, each donated $2 million to the super PAC ahead of the 2022 midterms. 2022 is the third election cycle in which members of the Bezos family made up the majority of contributions to the PAC, following $12.2 million in contributions in 2018 and $2 million in 2020.\nWith Honor Fund has spent about $190,000 on 2022 federal elections so far. The super PAC spent $113,000 on billboard advertising and direct mail for Emily Beach, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. House in California’s 15th Congressional District, and $71,000 for direct mail supporting Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D–Calif.) in California’s 19th Congressional District. California will hold its primary election on June 7.\nThe super PAC also spent $6,000 on billboard advertising for Stu Barnes-Israel, who lost the GOP primary election in Indiana’s 9th Congressional District in early May.\nDisclaimer: The Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in Politics, which merged to create OpenSecrets in 2021, previously received funding from Open Society Foundations.\nRead more OpenSecrets News & Analysis: Election 2022 · Super PACs\nSupport Accountability Journalism\nAt OpenSecrets.org we offer in-depth, money-in-politics stories in the public interest.

(Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>By Simone Pathe | CNN</strong></p>\n<p>The month of May brought the first <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/2022-midterm-election-calendar/\">Senate primaries of the year</a>. Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year&rsquo;s most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount.</p>\n<p>Republicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/president-donald-trump-45\">President Donald Trump</a> endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/donald-trump-jd-vance-ohio-senate/index.html\">Ohio</a>, where <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/politics/ohio-senate-primary-election-2022/index.html\">his chosen candidate won</a> on May 3; <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/politics/north-carolina-senate-race-ted-budd-donald-trump/index.html\">North Carolina</a>, where his chosen candidate won on May 17; <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/donald-trump-herschel-walker-endorsement-georgia-senate/index.html\">Georgia</a>, where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/politics/trump-endorsements-may-primaries/index.html\">tried to appeal to him</a> &mdash; in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped &ldquo;Hillbilly Elegy&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/politics/jd-vance-ohio-republican-senate-race/index.html\">author J.D. Vance</a> win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him &mdash; the candidate&rsquo;s past criticism of Trump.</p>\n<p>The former President&rsquo;s backing of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/politics/oz-trump-mccormick-pennsylvania-barnette/index.html\">Mehmet Oz</a> in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/politics/trump-dr-oz-kathy-barnette-pa-gop-senate/index.html\">Kathy Barnette</a>, but she&rsquo;s in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick.</p>\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/politics/north-carolina-senate-race-ted-budd-donald-trump/index.html\">weighed in</a> on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn&rsquo;t clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination.</p>\n<p>Democrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/politics/john-fetterman-pennsylvania-democrats-senate/index.html\">a crowded primary in Pennsylvania</a>, but it didn&rsquo;t attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.)</p>\n<p>After watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/joe-biden-news\">President Joe Biden</a>&lsquo;s approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/politics/cnn-poll-economy-biden-approval/index.html\">CNN poll</a>, conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/23/politics/democrats-biden-title-42-immigration-border/index.html\">broke with the White House</a> on lifting <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/politics/title-42-explainer-cec/index.html\">Title 42</a>, a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries.</p>\n<p>Senate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they&rsquo;re facing.</p>\n<p>CNN&rsquo;s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans&rsquo; favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN&rsquo;s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.</p>\n<h3>1. Pennsylvania</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)</strong></p>\n<p>Pennsylvania &mdash; a state Biden won in 2020 &mdash; has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn&rsquo;t yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/09/politics/trump-mehmet-oz-endorsement-pennsylvania/index.html\">Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz</a>, who has Trump&rsquo;s backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie &mdash; with a margin close enough to trigger the state&rsquo;s automatic recount process.</p>\n<p>Counties need to finish recounting &mdash; which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation &mdash; by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race.</p>\n<p>The winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17.</p>\n<p>Oz has declared himself <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/politics/dr-oz-pennsylvania-senate-recount/index.html\">the &ldquo;presumptive&rdquo; nominee</a>, following the lead of Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/politics/trump-dr-oz-pa-senate-primary/index.html\">urged him to declare victory</a> while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President&rsquo;s support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. &ldquo;I like Trump &hellip; but not his Senate pick,&rdquo; voters said in <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/18075cd3-fd8d-4ea1-be7c-8c7af0a86f3e\">one McCormick ad</a> ahead of the primary.</p>\n<p>Political commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn&rsquo;t enough, though. Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick.</p>\n<p>The lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump&rsquo;s backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount &mdash; and what that means for the general election. Oz&rsquo;s negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively.</p>\n<p>Fetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/politics/john-fetterman-pennsylvania-democrats-senate/index.html\">ads ahead of the primary, </a>in which he vowed to &ldquo;take on Washington,&rdquo; coming across as a progressive trying to run as a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/politics/john-fetterman-pennsylvania-democrats-senate/index.html\">populist outsider</a>. His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/pennsylvania-senate-primaries-mccormick-fetterman/index.html\">in debates</a>, especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/politics/fetterman-health-pennsylvania-senate-campaign/index.html\">suffered a stroke</a>, leaving him in the hospital on election night.</p>\n<p>The former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who&rsquo;s also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating &ldquo;Trump Republicans&rdquo; in his Pittsburgh-area House seat.</p>\n<h3>2. Georgia</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock</strong></p>\n<p>Despite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/politics/kfile-herschel-walker-overstated-academic-achievements/index.html\">Herschel Walker</a>, who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/politics/democratic-senate-candidates-running-against-dc/index.html\">Raphael Warnock</a>.</p>\n<p>Having won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/b65de910-3dca-4fc3-92bf-17ea75db1c71\">direct-to-camera ads</a> on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year.</p>\n<p>But Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/politics/kfile-herschel-walker-overstated-academic-achievements/index.html\">myriad of questions</a> about his business background and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/herschel-walker-stalking-claim-invs/index.html\">allegations of threats</a> he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats&rsquo; road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it&rsquo;s still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President.</p>\n<p>One unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump&rsquo;s endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State&rsquo;s GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won&rsquo;t necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump&rsquo;s outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state&rsquo;s Senate seats.</p>\n<h3>3. Nevada</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto</strong></p>\n<p>The Silver State moved up two slots in May&rsquo;s ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/17/politics/nevada-2022-democrats-republicans-france-election/index.html\">tough race in a transient state</a> that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President&rsquo;s approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/state-gas-price-averages/\">highest gas prices</a> in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that&rsquo;s trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/27/politics/latino-voters-texas-democrats-trump/index.html\">Latino voters</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t help that the state Democratic Party is fractured.</p>\n<p>Cortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats&rsquo; campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/ron-desantis-2024-nevada-laxalt/index.html\">Adam Laxalt</a> in the first quarter of the year &mdash; $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn&rsquo;t expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general &mdash; he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role &mdash; and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump&rsquo;s 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it&rsquo;s time for a change in Washington.</p>\n<p>Laxalt first faces <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/nevada\">a primary on June 14</a>. Club for Growth Action, which is backing him, is <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/100683a2-ca57-4b14-b971-a6a59ef74ebb\">on the air</a> attacking Army veteran Sam Brown, who&rsquo;s proven to be a competitive fundraiser. Laxalt is touting Trump&rsquo;s backing in <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/817b6faf-06d0-4ba6-a2aa-cc2c12f30de0\">his own recent spot</a>.</p>\n<h3>4. Arizona</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly</strong></p>\n<p>Holding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/06/politics/mark-kelly-arizona-senate/index.html\">winning a special election</a> in 2020. He&rsquo;s one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House &mdash; such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Kelly, the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/20/politics/arizona-republicans-election-conspiracies-trump/index.html\">messy Republican primary field</a> won&rsquo;t be sorted until August. So while he&rsquo;s facing <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/62da90bb-0477-4fb8-b521-c8e7f29a38ff\">attacks from the National Republican Senatorial Committee</a>, he doesn&rsquo;t yet have a well-defined opponent. Trump has teased that an endorsement is coming. It&rsquo;s unlikely to be for state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who&rsquo;s been a target of the former President&rsquo;s wrath for not doing more to investigate the 2020 election. Venture capitalist Blake Masters is backed by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/tech/peter-thiel-facebook-exit-gop-politics/index.html\">Peter Thiel</a>, who was also behind Trump&rsquo;s chosen candidate in Ohio. But Masters also has the endorsement of the Club for Growth, which may not sit well with Trump given <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/trump-club-for-growth-ohio/index.html\">his differences with the group</a> over the Ohio Senate primary.</p>\n<h3>5. Wisconsin</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson</strong></p>\n<p>GOP Sen. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/04/politics/ron-johnson-evolution/index.html\">Ron Johnson</a> finally stepped up his fundraising &mdash; he brought in <a href=\"https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00482984/1587142/\">about $6 million</a> in the first three months of the year after announcing in January that he was breaking his pledge to only serve two terms. He&rsquo;s been running <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/9131dc66-7a0c-4e18-87a2-00e6a433a81e\">positive spots</a>, featuring <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/b7fd3c07-0f31-43e2-9e72-1347f933c399\">families who say</a> their terminally ill loved ones benefited from Johnson&rsquo;s support for so-called Right to Try legislation.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular &mdash; 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/04/27/new-survey-by-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-wisconsin-democratic-primary-for-u-s-senate-tightening-kleefisch-leading-republican-gubernatorial-primary-among-republicans-those-least-confident-in-2/\">Marquette University Law School poll</a> released Wednesday. (In February, the <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/03/02/new-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-inflation-fears-up-pandemic-fears-down-marijuana-legalization-up-optimism-about-wisconsin-down-primary-candidates-not-yet-well-known/\">same poll</a> found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase &ldquo;cares about people like me&rdquo; did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat.</p>\n<p>But Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low.</p>\n<p>The Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/politics/mandela-barnes-wisconsin-senate/index.html\"> Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes</a>, who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn&rsquo;t picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/f3f1b9fb-94b7-49fd-81f9-2d353dba5f52\">his first TV ad</a> in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past.</p>\n<h3>6. New Hampshire</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan</strong></p>\n<p>New Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field &mdash; upended late last year by Gov. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/chris-sununu-new-hampshire-senate/index.html\">Chris Sununu&rsquo;s decision</a> not to seek the nomination &mdash; develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state&rsquo;s other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire&rsquo;s late primary in September.</p>\n<p>Hassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu&rsquo;s caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration&rsquo;s plan to lift Title 42, making her own <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/politics/title-42-democratic-strategy/index.html\">trip to the border</a> last month that angered several Latino leaders back home.</p>\n<h3>7. North Carolina</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)</strong></p>\n<p>One of Trump&rsquo;s earliest Senate primary endorsements &mdash; for US Rep. Ted Budd last June &mdash; resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/putin-pat-mccrory-ted-budd-north-carolina/index.html\">Gov. Pat McCrory</a> and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.</p>\n<p>The Trump endorsement didn&rsquo;t clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/a577f5b6-96b3-4e6f-b963-f6233d7e60bb\">One spot</a> ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. &ldquo;Pat&rsquo;s a nice guy, but he&rsquo;s no conservative,&rdquo; Robinson says, admitting that he&rsquo;d voted for McCrory in the past &ldquo;but not this time.&rdquo; McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is &ldquo;weak&rdquo; on a host of issues.</p>\n<p>On the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/16/politics/jackson-beasley-north-carolina-senate-race/index.html\">essentially already cleared the primary field</a> and pivoted to the general election. &ldquo;Looking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,&rdquo; she said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6D5UnPmgO8\">in an ad</a> ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won&rsquo;t be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWUzZd0_55I\">ad</a> buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring.</p>\n<h3>8. Florida</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio</strong></p>\n<p>Democratic Rep. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/who-is-val-demings/index.html\">Val Demings</a>, a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/politics/senate-house-2022-first-quarter-fundraising/index.html\">continues to outraise </a>Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio&rsquo;s $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign.</p>\n<p>But while money is important in this expensive state, it won&rsquo;t be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/19/politics/florida-politics-2022/index.html\">disadvantage in a state</a> where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio&rsquo;s campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/politics/immigration-title-42-repeal-cdc/index.html\">decision to rescind Title 42</a>. Demings&rsquo; team <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/23/politics/democrats-biden-title-42-immigration-border/index.html\">recently said she does not support</a> lifting the measure &ldquo;until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>9. Ohio</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/politics/trump-endorsements-may-primaries/index.html\">first major test</a> of Trump&rsquo;s endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President. &ldquo;Hillbilly Elegy&rdquo; author <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/donald-trump-jd-vance-ohio-senate/index.html\">J.D. Vance</a>, who received Trump&rsquo;s backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/results/ohio/republican-primaries/senate\">32% of the vote</a>, finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%).</p>\n<p>Vance&rsquo;s public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/23/politics/democrats-biden-title-42-immigration-border/index.html\">Fox poll</a> ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it&rsquo;s likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter.</p>\n<p>Still, missing out on Trump&rsquo;s endorsement didn&rsquo;t stop <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/ohio-senate-republican-primary-trump-vance-endorsement/index.html\">the jockeying among some other candidates</a> (and their allies) to tie themselves most closely to him. Club for Growth Action, for example, which had backed Mandel and is in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/trump-club-for-growth-ohio/index.html\">an open spat with Trump</a>, ran more <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/58340860-8845-42d3-9aa9-946a46d80f54\">clips of Vance&rsquo;s past criticism</a> of Trump. Another Club ad featured people, some of whom said &ldquo;they love Trump,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://host2.adimpact.com/admo/viewer/7da051aa-25b2-4142-b5d2-2cdff3183b67\">questioning the former President&rsquo;s judgment</a> on endorsements past and present.</p>\n<p>Only Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons.</p>\n<p>Democratic <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/politics/tim-ryan-ohio-senate-democratic-primary/index.html\">Rep. Tim Ryan</a> easily won his party&rsquo;s nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state.</p>\n<h3>10. Missouri</h3>\n<p><strong>Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s still all about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/republican-primary-missouri-senate-race/index.html\">Eric Greitens</a> in Missouri &mdash; does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump&rsquo;s endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri &mdash; a red state that shouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be competitive &mdash; remains on this list.</p>\n<p>Concerns about Greitens <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/politics/eric-greitens-abuse-accusations-missouri-senate-candidate/index.html\">deepened in March</a> after court documents revealed that his former wife had alleged he was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/politics/eric-greitens-ex-wife-abuse-allegation-photos-documents/index.html\">physically abusive</a> toward her and his children, which he denies. Greitens is no stranger to controversy, having <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/29/politics/eric-greitens-missouri-governor/index.html\">resigned as governor</a> amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Many of his primary opponents <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/missouri-senate-gop-primary/index.html\">have called on him to drop out</a>. Anxious Republicans would like to see their primary field thin, fearing that such a crowded pool of candidates could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote and handing him a victory.</p>\n<p>Some Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn&rsquo;t said how much she&rsquo;ll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win &mdash; while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s going anywhere.</p>\n<p>The-CNN-Wire<br>\n &trade; &amp; &copy; 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.</p>","id":"ART232126026258","text":"By Simone Pathe | CNN\nThe month of May brought the first Senate primaries of the year. Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year’s most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount.\nRepublicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former President Donald Trump endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall — Ohio, where his chosen candidate won on May 3; North Carolina, where his chosen candidate won on May 17; Georgia, where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, tried to appeal to him — in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\nTrump’s support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him — the candidate’s past criticism of Trump.\nThe former President’s backing of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, but she’s in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick.\nTrump weighed in on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn’t clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination.\nDemocrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had a crowded primary in Pennsylvania, but it didn’t attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.)\nAfter watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. President Joe Biden‘s approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a CNN poll, conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them broke with the White House on lifting Title 42, a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries.\nSenate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they’re facing.\nCNN’s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans’ favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN’s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n1. Pennsylvania\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\nPennsylvania — a state Biden won in 2020 — has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn’t yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz, who has Trump’s backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie — with a margin close enough to trigger the state’s automatic recount process.\nCounties need to finish recounting — which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation — by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race.\nThe winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17.\nOz has declared himself the “presumptive” nominee, following the lead of Trump, who urged him to declare victory while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President’s support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. “I like Trump … but not his Senate pick,” voters said in one McCormick ad ahead of the primary.\nPolitical commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn’t enough, though. Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick.\nThe lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump’s backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount — and what that means for the general election. Oz’s negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively.\nFetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his ads ahead of the primary, in which he vowed to “take on Washington,” coming across as a progressive trying to run as a populist outsider. His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him in debates, especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had suffered a stroke, leaving him in the hospital on election night.\nThe former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who’s also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating “Trump Republicans” in his Pittsburgh-area House seat.\n2. Georgia\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\nDespite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player Herschel Walker, who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.\nHaving won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running direct-to-camera ads on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year.\nBut Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a myriad of questions about his business background and allegations of threats he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats’ road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it’s still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President.\nOne unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump’s endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State’s GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won’t necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump’s outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state’s Senate seats.\n3. Nevada\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\nThe Silver State moved up two slots in May’s ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough race in a transient state that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President’s approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that’s trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with Latino voters. It doesn’t help that the state Democratic Party is fractured.\nCortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee Adam Laxalt in the first quarter of the year — $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn’t expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general — he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role — and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump’s 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it’s time for a change in Washington.\nLaxalt first faces a primary on June 14. Club for Growth Action, which is backing him, is on the air attacking Army veteran Sam Brown, who’s proven to be a competitive fundraiser. Laxalt is touting Trump’s backing in his own recent spot.\n4. Arizona\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\nHolding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He’s one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House — such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President.\nLuckily for Kelly, the messy Republican primary field won’t be sorted until August. So while he’s facing attacks from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he doesn’t yet have a well-defined opponent. Trump has teased that an endorsement is coming. It’s unlikely to be for state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who’s been a target of the former President’s wrath for not doing more to investigate the 2020 election. Venture capitalist Blake Masters is backed by Peter Thiel, who was also behind Trump’s chosen candidate in Ohio. But Masters also has the endorsement of the Club for Growth, which may not sit well with Trump given his differences with the group over the Ohio Senate primary.\n5. Wisconsin\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\nGOP Sen. Ron Johnson finally stepped up his fundraising — he brought in about $6 million in the first three months of the year after announcing in January that he was breaking his pledge to only serve two terms. He’s been running positive spots, featuring families who say their terminally ill loved ones benefited from Johnson’s support for so-called Right to Try legislation.\nThat’s not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular — 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday. (In February, the same poll found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase “cares about people like me” did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat.\nBut Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low.\nThe Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn’t picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with his first TV ad in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past.\n6. New Hampshire\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\nNew Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field — upended late last year by Gov. Chris Sununu’s decision not to seek the nomination — develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state’s other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire’s late primary in September.\nHassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu’s caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration’s plan to lift Title 42, making her own trip to the border last month that angered several Latino leaders back home.\n7. North Carolina\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\nOne of Trump’s earliest Senate primary endorsements — for US Rep. Ted Budd last June — resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.\nThe Trump endorsement didn’t clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. One spot ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. “Pat’s a nice guy, but he’s no conservative,” Robinson says, admitting that he’d voted for McCrory in the past “but not this time.” McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is “weak” on a host of issues.\nOn the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had essentially already cleared the primary field and pivoted to the general election. “Looking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,” she said in an ad ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won’t be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an ad buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring.\n8. Florida\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, continues to outraise Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio’s $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign.\nBut while money is important in this expensive state, it won’t be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a disadvantage in a state where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio’s campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden’s decision to rescind Title 42. Demings’ team recently said she does not support lifting the measure “until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.”\n9. Ohio\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\nThe first major test of Trump’s endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President. “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance, who received Trump’s backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about 32% of the vote, finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%).\nVance’s public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it’s likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter.\nStill, missing out on Trump’s endorsement didn’t stop the jockeying among some other candidates (and their allies) to tie themselves most closely to him. Club for Growth Action, for example, which had backed Mandel and is in an open spat with Trump, ran more clips of Vance’s past criticism of Trump. Another Club ad featured people, some of whom said “they love Trump,” questioning the former President’s judgment on endorsements past and present.\nOnly Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons.\nDemocratic Rep. Tim Ryan easily won his party’s nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state.\n10. Missouri\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\nIt’s still all about Eric Greitens in Missouri — does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump’s endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri — a red state that shouldn’t otherwise be competitive — remains on this list.\nConcerns about Greitens deepened in March after court documents revealed that his former wife had alleged he was physically abusive toward her and his children, which he denies. Greitens is no stranger to controversy, having resigned as governor amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Many of his primary opponents have called on him to drop out. Anxious Republicans would like to see their primary field thin, fearing that such a crowded pool of candidates could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote and handing him a victory.\nSome Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn’t said how much she’ll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win — while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Raphael Warnock (D-GA), against whom they have nominated Trump-approved former football player Herschel Walker.\nWatch below:\nStories Chosen For You","crawlTimestamp":1654096470,"summary":"On CNN Wednesday, Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Patricia Murphy revealed that Republicans in...","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-afp.jpg?id=25836690&width=1200&coordinates=0%2C51%2C0%2C52&height=600","types":["Article","GlobalIndexDiffbotEntity"],"images":[{"summary":"","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-afp.jpg?id=25836690&width=1200&coordinates=0%2C51%2C0%2C52&height=600","naturalHeight":600,"name":"","url":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-afp.jpg?id=25836690&width=1200&coordinates=0%2C51%2C0%2C52&height=600","naturalWidth":1200}],"author":"Matthew Chapman","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/ART40978239365","tags":[{"score":0.99943507,"sentiment":-0.987,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":12,"label":"Donald Trump","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EY1mA3TomNVWxY0sLifAwEQ"},{"score":0.99881935,"sentiment":-0.958,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":7,"label":"Georgia","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E_L-1Z6pbMUuEvXV5RpTMaQ"},{"score":0.9354101,"sentiment":-0.923,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty"],"count":1,"label":"Georgia Republican Party","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/ESU4M4YnHOBm0w90M4E37PQ"},{"score":0.92955506,"sentiment":-0.79,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty"],"count":4,"label":"Republican Party","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EQux7TYFDMgO6n_OByeSXzg"},{"score":0.9166222,"sentiment":-0.455,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":8,"label":"Brian Kemp","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EYu86qnLnMJSovrKFbbvdyQ"},{"score":0.8961847,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":3,"label":"David Perdue","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EczYBtsVJPuCLiM_VPsp81Q"},{"score":0.8183766,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":1,"label":"Brianna Keilar","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EtRnWoog1MVG2uQ2A7MNSUQ"},{"score":0.7921381,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation"],"count":2,"label":"United States Senate","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EDXOHrBYDNaaAmnqOgZT_qg"},{"score":0.7801365,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":1,"label":"Herschel Walker","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EH68p_DdAPqOhAwCi3cVm7Q"},{"score":0.59069896,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Award","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PersonFunction","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Profession"],"count":2,"label":"journalist","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E-gkGHLdOPUCUciJo_Urukg"}],"lastCrawlTime":1654096470,"publisherCountry":"United States","name":"'Enormous anxiety' among Georgia GOP that Trump will sabotage them again this fall: reporter","pageUrl":"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-georgia-2657434966/","resolvedPageUrl":""}},

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who has built her political brand in large measure around her devotion to guns, responded to Massie&rsquo;s tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laurenboebert/status/1468411381653323777\">with a photo of her</a> and her sons holding similar assault rifles with a message to her colleague: &ldquo;The Boeberts have your six&rdquo; &mdash; military jargon for having someone&rsquo;s back.</p>\n<p>While most representatives of the elected officials and candidates cited in this report did not immediately respond to a request for comment, John Kennedy, communications director for Massie, defended his boss&rsquo;s decision to promote his photograph and said it did not send a dangerous message.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rep. Massie&rsquo;s photo was so popular with his Kentucky constituents that the most commonly heard complaint we received was that this photo was not released as the actual Christmas card,&rdquo; Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>Over the past several election cycles, Democrats running in rural, conservative-leaning states have also featured guns in their ads. In 2010, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) famously shot a gun at a Democratic environmental and energy proposal bill in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIJORBRpOPM&feature=youtu.be\">campaign ad</a>, and eight years later, he released another one shooting at a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Democrats in recent years have outpaced Republican spending on gun-related ads, a signal of the party&rsquo;s increasing inclination to campaign for stricter gun laws. But so far this year, Republicans have aired dozens more ads about guns than Democrats, according to data analyzed by AdImpact. The media-tracking firm identified 121 Republican ads dealing with guns and just 18 Democratic ones that are gun-related.</p>\n<p>Sullivan said Republicans who highlight gun imagery in primaries where the competition for GOP base voters is intense might pay a political price in the general election. Others took a similar view.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It seems to be a rite of passage now for Republicans in primaries to prove how tough they are protecting the Second Amendment,&rdquo; said Neil Oxman, a Democratic communications strategist in Pennsylvania. &ldquo;It is their calling card to tell Republican voters that they are conservative, and by doing that, you don&rsquo;t really have to do anything else. By doing that, that&rsquo;s enough for the Republican primary voters who have gone further and further to the right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Olivia Troye, who was a homeland security adviser to former vice president Mike Pence and worked on mass shootings and domestic terrorism issues, warned that the promotion of guns and violence by Republican candidates and elected officials has far reaching implications, in part by &ldquo;normalizing and mainstreaming a weapon that is designed and meant to kill.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ron Filipkowski, a lifelong Republican who also broke with the party over former president Donald Trump and now tracks right-wing messaging, said he first noticed the uptick in gun-related GOP ads in August when he kept seeing Republican candidates sharing images of themselves with assault-style firearms and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1422589202965966851\">decided to tally them</a>. He said he got to about a dozen before they became too frequent to keep up with in real-time.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really become a cultural thing now.

I&rsquo;m a badass. Come and take this away.' &rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) recently sent a mailer to constituents that showed her clutching an AR-15-style weapon in one picture and shooting a handgun in another. Kevin Knoth, Hartzler&rsquo;s spokesman, said in an email that the mail was approved May 12 and sent for delivery May 13 before the deadly mass shootings at supermarket in Buffalo and an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex.</p>\n<p>Knoth did not respond directly when asked if Hartzler regrets that some of her constituents received the mailer after those tragedies, saying only that the congresswoman &ldquo;is praying for all those lost and their loved ones&rdquo; and is urging support for legislation to allow off-duty and retired law enforcement personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds.</p>\n<p>Mark McCloskey, who once <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/19/missouri-mark-mccloskey-senate-campaign/?itid=lk_inline_manual_39\">pointed a gun</a> at Black Lives Matter protesters and is now running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Missouri, has images of assault weapons all over his social media. &ldquo;Firearms are the ultimate equalizer,&rdquo; one post says, over a photo of him holding a gun. On his campaign website, he boasts that his story &ldquo;has empowered thousands of new gun owners across the country to purchase a firearm and learn how to defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This year, an Arizona Republican running to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly released an ad that portrayed him as a sheriff and<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/10/campaign-ad-senate-candidate-shoots-gun-actors-playing-biden-pelosi-sen-mark-kelly-whose-wife-gabby-giffords-was-injured-arizona-rampage/?itid=lk_inline_manual_41\"> showed him in an old Western-style standoff</a> with actors playing Kelly, President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).</p>\n<p>In the ad, the GOP candidate, businessman Jim Lamon, says: &ldquo;The good people of Arizona have had enough of you.

Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1377726295103131649\">a video on Twitter </a>of himself shooting an AR-15 in a gun range. &ldquo;Now, why would anybody need to own an AR-15?&rdquo; Graham asked in a follow-up post. &ldquo;If there is a breakdown of law and order, and that can happen &hellip; it&rsquo;s not impossible to find yourself in the modern world without any police protection, because that&rsquo;s just the way the times are in which we live in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Senator Graham is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment,&rdquo; Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop said, when asked about the senator&rsquo;s social media posts.</p>\n<p>Political campaigns and organizations have held contests gifting military-assault weapons to supporters. In Georgia, Josh Clark, a Republican Senate candidate who recently lost the primary to former football star Herschel Walker, said in March that he planned to give away an AR-15 every week until the election. His goal, he said, was to &ldquo;advance&rdquo; the use of AR-15 rifles, which he said &ldquo;should be one of the most commonly owned firearms across America.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Last fall, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) gave supporters a chance to win a 50-caliber rifle <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhT9Yp1tK1Q\">she used in an ad to blow up a Toyota Prius</a> with the word &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; emblazoned on its side. The footage showed the massive explosion from various angles and directed viewers to a website that allowed them to enter to win Greene&rsquo;s rifle.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the same type of gun that TRIGGERS the Fake News Media and Democrats all across the country,&rdquo; Greene&rsquo;s webpage read. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s the same type of gun the hate-America gun-grabbers in DC would love to BAN if they ever get the votes.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe height=\"0\" src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-WHNNX8B\" width=\"0\"></iframe></figure>","id":"ART139511671692","text":"Former hedge fund CEO David McCormick first shoots the hunting rifle he says he used as a teenager.

Massie’s photo was so popular with his Kentucky constituents that the most commonly heard complaint we received was that this photo was not released as the actual Christmas card,” Kennedy said.\nOver the past several election cycles, Democrats running in rural, conservative-leaning states have also featured guns in their ads. In 2010, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) famously shot a gun at a Democratic environmental and energy proposal bill in a campaign ad, and eight years later, he released another one shooting at a lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.\nDemocrats in recent years have outpaced Republican spending on gun-related ads, a signal of the party’s increasing inclination to campaign for stricter gun laws. But so far this year, Republicans have aired dozens more ads about guns than Democrats, according to data analyzed by AdImpact. The media-tracking firm identified 121 Republican ads dealing with guns and just 18 Democratic ones that are gun-related.\nSullivan said Republicans who highlight gun imagery in primaries where the competition for GOP base voters is intense might pay a political price in the general election. Others took a similar view.\n“It seems to be a rite of passage now for Republicans in primaries to prove how tough they are protecting the Second Amendment,” said Neil Oxman, a Democratic communications strategist in Pennsylvania. “It is their calling card to tell Republican voters that they are conservative, and by doing that, you don’t really have to do anything else. By doing that, that’s enough for the Republican primary voters who have gone further and further to the right.”\nOlivia Troye, who was a homeland security adviser to former vice president Mike Pence and worked on mass shootings and domestic terrorism issues, warned that the promotion of guns and violence by Republican candidates and elected officials has far reaching implications, in part by “normalizing and mainstreaming a weapon that is designed and meant to kill.”\nRon Filipkowski, a lifelong Republican who also broke with the party over former president Donald Trump and now tracks right-wing messaging, said he first noticed the uptick in gun-related GOP ads in August when he kept seeing Republican candidates sharing images of themselves with assault-style firearms and decided to tally them. He said he got to about a dozen before they became too frequent to keep up with in real-time.\n“It’s really become a cultural thing now. It used to be a cultural thing as hunting goes, but these guys aren’t hunting … I’m talking about running around playing warrior. They view that as a sport now, and to participate in that sport, you need assault weapons,” Filipkowski said. “It’s the posing with them in pictures to say, ‘Hey, I’m a tough guy. I’m a badass. Come and take this away.' ”\nRep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) recently sent a mailer to constituents that showed her clutching an AR-15-style weapon in one picture and shooting a handgun in another. Kevin Knoth, Hartzler’s spokesman, said in an email that the mail was approved May 12 and sent for delivery May 13 before the deadly mass shootings at supermarket in Buffalo and an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex.\nKnoth did not respond directly when asked if Hartzler regrets that some of her constituents received the mailer after those tragedies, saying only that the congresswoman “is praying for all those lost and their loved ones” and is urging support for legislation to allow off-duty and retired law enforcement personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds.\nMark McCloskey, who once pointed a gun at Black Lives Matter protesters and is now running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Missouri, has images of assault weapons all over his social media. “Firearms are the ultimate equalizer,” one post says, over a photo of him holding a gun. On his campaign website, he boasts that his story “has empowered thousands of new gun owners across the country to purchase a firearm and learn how to defend themselves.”\nThis year, an Arizona Republican running to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly released an ad that portrayed him as a sheriff and showed him in an old Western-style standoff with actors playing Kelly, President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\nIn the ad, the GOP candidate, businessman Jim Lamon, says: “The good people of Arizona have had enough of you. It’s time for a showdown.” The three Democrats draw their weapons. Lamon points his gun and shoots the weapons out of their hands. The Kelly, Biden and Pelosi characters run away. The ad drew some criticism, including from Republican rivals.\nLast spring, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) posted a video on Twitter of himself shooting an AR-15 in a gun range. “Now, why would anybody need to own an AR-15?” Graham asked in a follow-up post. “If there is a breakdown of law and order, and that can happen … it’s not impossible to find yourself in the modern world without any police protection, because that’s just the way the times are in which we live in.”\n“Senator Graham is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment,” Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop said, when asked about the senator’s social media posts.\nPolitical campaigns and organizations have held contests gifting military-assault weapons to supporters. In Georgia, Josh Clark, a Republican Senate candidate who recently lost the primary to former football star Herschel Walker, said in March that he planned to give away an AR-15 every week until the election. His goal, he said, was to “advance” the use of AR-15 rifles, which he said “should be one of the most commonly owned firearms across America.”\nLast fall, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) gave supporters a chance to win a 50-caliber rifle she used in an ad to blow up a Toyota Prius with the word “socialism” emblazoned on its side. The footage showed the massive explosion from various angles and directed viewers to a website that allowed them to enter to win Greene’s rifle.\n“This is the same type of gun that TRIGGERS the Fake News Media and Democrats all across the country,” Greene’s webpage read. “And it’s the same type of gun the hate-America gun-grabbers in DC would love to BAN if they ever get the votes.”","crawlTimestamp":1654051973,"summary":"Former hedge fund CEO David McCormick first shoots the hunting rifle he says he used as a teenager. ...","image":"","types":["Article","GlobalIndexDiffbotEntity"],"author":"Colby Itkowitz","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/ART139511671692","tags":[{"score":0.98732597,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":4,"label":"David H.

Pennsylvania acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman officially announced the recall Wednesday afternoon, and the process began Friday.\nThe recount should be done by June 7, with the results released the day after.\nThe McCormick campaign is requesting a hand recount in 12 counties, a senior McCormick campaign official told reporters Tuesday.\nThe official said they’re requesting the hand recount to happen “concurrently” to the state-ordered recount “so we can get a resolution to this and get behind the nominee and move forward.”\nMcCormick’s campaign is also suing to have counted ballots that were mailed in without a written date on the envelopes, as is typically required, but that were received on or before Election Day. Those ballots are also dated upon receipt by election officials.\nThe ultimate nominee will face off in November against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D), who is currently recovering from a stroke.\nAD WATCH\nOne Nation, the nonprofit arm of Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, released a new ad in Georgia Tuesday targeting Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) over inflation.\nThe video, part of a $17.1 million blitz in the Peach State, casts Warnock as partially responsible for the surge in prices after voting for Biden’s COVID-19 stimulus package last year.\n“Senator Raphael Warnock was the deciding vote for President Biden’s multi-trillion dollar spending spree. Sending inflation through the roof and raising gas and grocery prices over ten percent on hard-working Georgians. Tell Senator Warnock to stop fighting for reckless spending – and start fighting inflation,” a narrator says in the ad.\nGeorgia is set to be at the center of the political universe later this year, with contested Senate and gubernatorial races up for grabs. Warnock, who won in a special election in 2021, is running for a full term of his own this year against former football star Herschel Walker, and former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams is trying to unseat Gov. Brian Kemp (R).\nDemocrats are bullish that Warnock and Abrams present a powerful duo at the top of the general election ballot, but Republicans boast that this year’s political atmosphere — driven mainly by inflation — could sink them.\nThat’s it for today.

After an action-packed May, we’re already looking forward to where some of the biggest primary fights of June will be. Follow the money with us:\nA pair of open Southern California seats are filling up with spending along increasingly common Democratic dividing lines. In the 42nd District, United Democracy Project (the AIPAC super PAC) has dropped some $515,000 so far on ads opposing state Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia and backing Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia. DMFI PAC, another pro-Israel group, and crypto-focused Web3 Forward are also chiming in for Robert Garcia. That pair of groups, along with Protect Our Future, is also boosting state Sen. Sydney Kamlager in the open 42nd District with close to $1 million combined.\nRepublicans are racing to bolster Rep. Young Kim. In 2020, Kim flipped back one of Democrats’ prized pickups from the 2018 midterms. But her new 40th District includes only one-fifth of her current constituents, per Daily Kos Elections’ excellent redistricting redistribution tables. And Kim and Congressional Leadership Fund ($553,000 so far, per FEC) are both going negative against GOP challenger Greg Raths, a frequent past congressional candidate, to avoid Kim getting bumped out of the top two in the June 7 primary in a Biden +2 district.\n— Also: CLF and its Democratic opposite, House Majority PAC, are both spending unusual amounts in the 22nd District, where GOP Rep. David Valadao is seeking reelection and Democratic state Assemblyman Rudy Salas is challenging him. CLF has spent about $332,000 so far, while HMP has dropped $261,000, according to the FEC. Incidentally, early-voting turnout in California is really lagging, so among other factors there may just be a desire to avoid any bizarre low-turnout surprises. (Catch a couple new ads from the super PACs in our TV section below.)\nThe GOP’s next member-versus-member primary is getting expensive. GOP Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis have dueling seven-figure outside group ad buys battling on their respective sides in Illinois’ 15th District ahead of June 28. The Club for Growth is backing Miller, while the mysterious Illinois Values PAC — which has yet to disclose its donors — is backing Davis. Davis is also getting a boost from American Dream Federal Action, the super PAC funded by crypto investor Ryan Salame which has been playing in a number of GOP congressional primaries.\nAnd a few from the FEC grab bag: CLF is also spending money to boost Republican John Duarte in CA-13, the new Biden +11 seat in the Central Valley … DMFI is backing Democrat Kevin Mullin and opposing David Canepa in CA-15 … Americans for Prosperity Action is boosting Republicans Nick Begich and Barbara Kirkmeyer in AK-AL and CO-08, respectively … the open IL-03 Democratic primary has VoteVets lining up on one side with Gilbert Villegas and EMILY’s LIst and the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC on the other side with Delia Ramirez ... keep an eye out for the new Opportunity for All Action Fund (donors as yet undisclosed), which has splashed cash in several primaries so far, including bucking up Democratic Reps. Danny Davis (IL-07) and Dina Titus (NV-01).\nWhich June primary are you tracking most closely?

So it&rsquo;s natural that in the wake of the setbacks his <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/kemp-trounces-trumps-guy-perdue-and-raffensperger-survives.html\">2022 Republican-primary endorsement program</a> experienced in Georgia on May 24, the once-and-would-be-future president is looking for excuses. The most tempting to him surely involves blaming his candidates &mdash; particularly the feckless gubernatorial aspirant <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/perdue-ends-campaign-with-racist-remarks-about-stacey-abrams.html\">David Perdue</a> and the even more feckless secretary of State challenger <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ed_kilgore/status/1529291866083975168\">Jody Hice</a>, who lost to Trump enemies Brian Kemp and Brad Raffensperger, respectively. But then that would reflect poorly on Trump&rsquo;s own judgment in hand-picking them to begin with, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>The website for Trump&rsquo;s official statements has only one allusion to the Georgia fiasco: an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/1531641422952247298\">&ldquo;ICYMI&rdquo; link</a> to a deranged bit of MAGA conspiracy-mongering basically claiming that only fraud can explain a Trump defeat this severe. But at his Wyoming rally over the weekend, Trump &ldquo;denounced crossover voting in Georgia, where all voters can choose which primary they want to vote in, by Democrats who opposed Perdue and Hice,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/29/trump-wyoming-cheney/\">noted</a> the Washington <em>Post</em>. Trump might have been engaging in a little preemptive spinning as well, since the candidate he is trying to purge in Wyoming, Congresswoman <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/02/gop-excommunicates-liz-cheney-for-opposing-the-insurrection.html\">Liz Cheney</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/14/liz-cheney-democrats-wyoming-00016905\">openly seeking to pull</a> Democrats and independents into her August 16 primary.</p>\n<p>The 45th president isn&rsquo;t the only one attracting attention to the participation of Democrats in the Georgia Republican primary; it received some serious buzz among election analysts with no particular stake in the outcome. In mid-May, the Atlanta <em>Journal-Constitution</em> <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-data-shows-thousands-of-democrats-voting-in-gop-primary/GIKGG65EWZEF7J2JO2DJBCIA2I/\">estimated</a> that about 7 percent of early voters in the GOP primary were Democratic primary voters in 2020. And after the voting was done, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-georgia-campaign-2016-congress-df4fa72d2d4a1e4d9344d61c0a3d4b9e\">Associated Press</a> suggested around 9 percent of 2022 Republican-primary early voters in Georgia were 2020 Democrats. So is Trump right? Did those rascally socialist Democrats sneak over into the GOP primary to smite candidates endorsed by the Greatest President Ever?</p>\n<p>Maybe and maybe not. First things first: There is absolutely nothing illegal or even mildly inappropriate about Georgia voters choosing to participate in either party&rsquo;s primaries as they wish. Georgia is one of <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx\">15 &ldquo;open primary&rdquo; states</a> with no party registration. Voters show up at the polls and are offered either a D or R primary ballot. And while there may be some truth in Trump&rsquo;s self-centered assumption that crossover voters were seeking to thwart his will, there&rsquo;s no way to distinguish them from <em>strategic</em> voters seeking to choose the weakest general-election candidate or simply from voters who changed their actual party affiliation for one reason or another (clearly the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/596688-kemp-drops-millions-on-ad-buy-ahead-of-georgia-primary/\">heavy ad spending</a> on the Republican side could have drawn in previously Democratic voters in the absence of competitive Democratic primaries in the gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races). I personally know Democratic voters in Georgia who routinely vote in Republican primaries because they live in deep-red jurisdictions where all the local contests are resolved in the GOP primary (the same was true in reverse for the many decades in which Democratic primaries were tantamount to general elections in states like Georgia).</p>\n<p>The other thing to keep in mind is the folly of trying to attribute close election victories to one of many potential causes.

So it’s natural that in the wake of the setbacks his 2022 Republican-primary endorsement program experienced in Georgia on May 24, the once-and-would-be-future president is looking for excuses. The most tempting to him surely involves blaming his candidates — particularly the feckless gubernatorial aspirant David Perdue and the even more feckless secretary of State challenger Jody Hice, who lost to Trump enemies Brian Kemp and Brad Raffensperger, respectively. But then that would reflect poorly on Trump’s own judgment in hand-picking them to begin with, wouldn’t it?\nThe website for Trump’s official statements has only one allusion to the Georgia fiasco: an “ICYMI” link to a deranged bit of MAGA conspiracy-mongering basically claiming that only fraud can explain a Trump defeat this severe. But at his Wyoming rally over the weekend, Trump “denounced crossover voting in Georgia, where all voters can choose which primary they want to vote in, by Democrats who opposed Perdue and Hice,” noted the Washington Post. Trump might have been engaging in a little preemptive spinning as well, since the candidate he is trying to purge in Wyoming, Congresswoman Liz Cheney, is openly seeking to pull Democrats and independents into her August 16 primary.\nThe 45th president isn’t the only one attracting attention to the participation of Democrats in the Georgia Republican primary; it received some serious buzz among election analysts with no particular stake in the outcome. In mid-May, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution estimated that about 7 percent of early voters in the GOP primary were Democratic primary voters in 2020. And after the voting was done, the Associated Press suggested around 9 percent of 2022 Republican-primary early voters in Georgia were 2020 Democrats. So is Trump right? Did those rascally socialist Democrats sneak over into the GOP primary to smite candidates endorsed by the Greatest President Ever?\nMaybe and maybe not. First things first: There is absolutely nothing illegal or even mildly inappropriate about Georgia voters choosing to participate in either party’s primaries as they wish. Georgia is one of 15 “open primary” states with no party registration. Voters show up at the polls and are offered either a D or R primary ballot. And while there may be some truth in Trump’s self-centered assumption that crossover voters were seeking to thwart his will, there’s no way to distinguish them from strategic voters seeking to choose the weakest general-election candidate or simply from voters who changed their actual party affiliation for one reason or another (clearly the heavy ad spending on the Republican side could have drawn in previously Democratic voters in the absence of competitive Democratic primaries in the gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races). I personally know Democratic voters in Georgia who routinely vote in Republican primaries because they live in deep-red jurisdictions where all the local contests are resolved in the GOP primary (the same was true in reverse for the many decades in which Democratic primaries were tantamount to general elections in states like Georgia).\nThe other thing to keep in mind is the folly of trying to attribute close election victories to one of many potential causes. The AP story on crossover voting in Georgia noted that the margin by which Raffensperger avoided a potentially dangerous runoff contest was smaller than the estimated number of Democratic voters participating in the GOP primary. Does that mean Democrats decided the outcome? Perhaps, but only if you assume (a) that nearly all of them voted for Raffensperger and (b) that he might not have won a runoff anyway.\nThe bigger issue in Georgia for Trump at the moment isn’t figuring out why his candidates lost but whether his anger at the primary outcome will lead him to sabotage the GOP ticket in November. His chief Peach State vanquisher, Kemp, is reportedly reaching out to the camp of the ex-president in order to arrange a truce to keep the GOP more or less united going into a tough general election in which Kemp will face a rematch with Democratic voting-rights champion Stacey Abrams, and Trump’s guy Herschel Walker will confront incumbent senator Raphael Warnock. It’s unclear what will happen, as the Journal-Constitution notes:\nTwo people close to Trump say the chances of reconciliation were worsened when former Vice President Mike Pence headlined a pre-primary rally for Kemp, furthering a split between the two former running-mates. Others remain hopeful they can at least minimize Trump’s potential harm in a race where even slight changes in voting patterns could have a significant effect on the results.\nTrump has several months to pout and whine before putting on the party harness and avoiding a replay of his destructive role in the 2021 runoffs in Georgia that gave control of the U.S. Senate to Democrats. But if he remains in a fantasyland in which even a 2022 Republican primary in a state controlled by his party was “rigged” against him, he may never make his way back to a position that makes any sense.","categories":[{"score":0.988,"name":"News and Politics","id":"iabv2-379"},{"score":0.91,"name":"Politics","id":"iabv2-386"}],"crawlTimestamp":1654026753,"summary":"Donald Trump isn’t known for owning up to his mistakes, ever.

Voter participation this year was up significantly from the 2018 state primary. On its face, Republicans appeared to be the largest beneficiary with more than 1 million votes cast in their party primary compared to approximately 725,000 in the Democratic primary. However, a closer look at the numbers shows that a noticeable number of traditionally Democratic voters crossed over in this year&rsquo;s primary to vote for Republican candidates. Speculation suggests that those voters may have crossed over to vote against a Trump-endorsed slate of candidates. One thing is clear however, if those voters return to Democratic candidates in November, then races up and down the ballot will be much closer than these primary results suggest.</p>\n<p>Almost twice as many Republicans voters went to the polls than did in the 2018 primary. This surge in Republican voters was a boon to Gov. Brian Kemp, who cruised to an overwhelming victory over former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, who had the backing of former President Donald Trump. While the official results are still to be finalized, Kemp appears to have garnered almost 74% of the Republican vote. With this victory under his belt, he now faces the challenge of uniting the Georgia GOP in hopes of securing a second term in November.</p>\n<p>In November, Kemp will again face former State House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who he narrowly defeated in the 2018 governor&rsquo;s race. Although Abrams was unopposed as her party&rsquo;s top gubernatorial contender, Democratic participation was up 28% over the 2018 primaries.</p>\n<p>Sen. Raphael Warnock handily defeated a Democratic challenger in his quest to win his first full term in the U.S. Senate. In November, he will face former University of Georgia football star Herschel Walker, who is heavily backed by Trump and easily emerged from a primary field of six Republican candidates.</p>\n<p>Overall, the quick analysis suggests that it was a very good night to be an incumbent. There were few upsets anywhere on the ballot, while Trump-backed candidates were a mixed bag. When the former President attempted to challenge an incumbent, almost all of his candidates suffered decisive defeats, with the governor&rsquo;s race serving as the most high-profile example. However, in open seats, his candidates typically carried the night. Looking toward November, Republicans will take comfort in what looks to be a rebound in its enthusiastic base. Combined with the current low poll numbers of President Biden, the GOP looks to be in solid shape to retain power in most of the state; although it may still be closer than it currently appears. Democrats will hope that Trump continues to be a thorn in the side of some Republicans and that Abrams can electrify and mobilize her base to continue to push the state bluer. Additionally, November will be the first major test for the state&rsquo;s amended, and much-discussed, election laws as well as offering newly redrawn Congressional and state legislative districts crafted to favor the Republican majority. One major change for this year&rsquo;s elections is the shortening of the runoff period. The June 21 runoffs come just four weeks after the primaries, compared to the nine-week runoff campaigns in previous years.</p>\n<p><strong>Down Ballot</strong></p>\n<p>The flipping of the state&rsquo;s two U.S. Senate seats last year coupled with Trump inserting himself in so many of the GOP contests resulted in many of the state&rsquo;s constitutional offices drawing more candidates that usual.</p>\n<p><strong>Lieutenant Governor</strong></p>\n<p>In the wake of Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan&rsquo;s decision to not seek another term in office, both the Republican and Democratic primaries drew an active list of candidates seeking to fill his vacancy. Although a small portion of votes are still being counted, the Democratic race appears to be headed for a runoff between the short-term Congressman Kwanza Hall, who was the top vote-getter with roughly 30% of the vote, and Charlie Bailey, who garnered a little more than 17%. While a handful of votes continue to trickle in, it looks like Trump-favorite, state Sen. Burt Jones has narrowly avoided a runoff against fellow state Sen. Butch Miller. At the time of this publication, Jones&rsquo; tally sits at just over 50% of the vote. Any outstanding votes could shrink his lead below the 50% plus 1 margin needed to avoid a runoff; however, many of those outstanding votes appear to be in Democratic counties, giving Jones&rsquo; campaign confidence that his lead will hold.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens in this race, it is sure to have a sizeable impact on the leadership in the state Senate during next year&rsquo;s legislative session. A Jones victory in November would almost certainly push the chamber further to the right, while a Democratic victory in the governor or lieutenant governor races would be minimized by the chamber&rsquo;s Republican majority.</p>\n<p><strong>Secretary of State</strong></p>\n<p>Incumbent Republican Brad Raffensperger, one of the most renowned Secretaries of State in Georgia history, was another example of Trump&rsquo;s inability to control the GOP. Raffensperger defeated three other Republicans to win renomination with 52% of the vote. One of the biggest surprises of the night was that Raffensperger was able to advance without a runoff. Although, he will have to wait to find out who his November opponent will be. The Democratic race appears to be headed for a runoff between state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who received roughly 44 % of the vote, and former state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler, who earned almost 19% of the vote despite having previously been unsuccessful in this race.</p>\n<p><strong>Attorney General </strong></p>\n<p>With only two candidates in each primary, the race for attorney general is set to avoid any runoff. Incumbent Republican Chris Carr fended off a Trump-endorsed candidate to cruise to victory with almost 74% of the vote. He will face a strong Democratic challenger in state Sen. Jen Jordan, who won her primary with more than 77% of the vote.</p>\n<p><strong>Insurance Commissioner</strong></p>\n<p>The incumbent Republican John King won his first state-wide race since being appointed to the position three years ago by Kemp. He defeated a Trump-backed opponent, winning 70% of the vote. In the Democratic primary, Janice Laws Robinson currently holds a near majority lead over the other contenders. Unless the final vote tally enables her to surmount the 50% threshold, she will face Raphael Baker, who earned roughly 33% of the vote, in a runoff. The winner will face King in November.</p>\n<p><strong>Labor Commissioner</strong></p>\n<p>A slate of candidates from both parties sought to replace outgoing Labor Commissioner Mark Butler.
