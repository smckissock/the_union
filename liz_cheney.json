It was ostensibly a speech in support of <b>HARRIET HAGEMAN</b>, his hand-picked candidate to take out Rep. <b>LIZ CHENEY</b> (R-Wyo.) in what Trump described here as &ldquo;the most important election&rdquo; of 2022 &mdash; and one that comes after a string of embarrassing primary defeats for Trump&rsquo;s picks in Nebraska, Idaho, Georgia and North Carolina.</p>\n<p><b>Trump meandered into issues far afield from the Wyoming race.</b> In fact, if you haven&rsquo;t tuned in lately, little has changed at a Trump rally. The former president appears to have put put on some weight, but he still looks younger than his 75 years, and the familiar mix of exaggerations, lies, sometimes hilarious mockery, dark conspiracies, personal grievances, perplexing asides, stream of consciousness riffs &mdash; all delivered in his uniform of a blue suit and long red tie &mdash; remains unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>How much the event benefited Hageman was unclear.</b> The parking lot was filled with license plates from Idaho, South Dakota, Montana, Colorado and Utah. On the security lines and in the hall, fans costumed in red ties, bedazzled MAGA dresses and at least one Trump-inspired catsuit traded notes on how many Trump rallies they&rsquo;ve attended across the country.</p>\n<p><b>Numerous non-Wyoming MAGA celebrities</b>, such as Rep. <b>LAUREN BOEBERT</b> (R-Colo.), who appeared before Trump, repeatedly pronounced Hageman&rsquo;s name incorrectly.</p>\n<p><b>As his recent losses make clear</b>, Trump seems to understand now that people come to see him, and may ignore whatever candidate he&rsquo;s hawking that day. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more fun than a Trump rally?&rdquo; he asked. The crowd cheered.</p>\n<p><b>After an hour of Trump delivering many familiar hits</b> &mdash; on Russia, impeachment, Jan. 6, the 2020 election, how he told NATO members he would not defend them if they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;pay,&rdquo; trade with China, <b>CHUCK TODD&rsquo;S</b> alleged lack of sleep, the relative merits of the journalists <b>CHRIS WALLACE</b> and his father <b>MIKE</b>, his conversations with the Taliban, the Durham investigation, and how, &ldquo;sadly,&rdquo; White House physician-turned-congressional candidate <b>RONNY JACKSON</b> knows Trump&rsquo;s body better than <b>MELANIA </b>does &mdash; Trump turned his attention to a newer obsession.</p>\n<p><b>&ldquo;No teacher should ever be allowed to teach transgender</b> to our children without parental consent,&rdquo; he said, just as some of the MAGA faithful started to trickle out. &ldquo;Can you imagine?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>On the perimeter of the arena</b>, some attendees headed for their cars stopped and began listening again on an outside monitor. Trump briefly got distracted when he caught a glimpse of himself on a video screen and noticed his hair was thinning in the back.</p>\n<p><b>But he then returned to the subject.</b></p>\n<p><b>&ldquo;We will save our kids and we will also keep men the hell out of women&rsquo;s sports</b>. Is that OK?&rdquo; he said, using what&rsquo;s become a common GOP refrain. He continued with an animated tale about a female swimmer about to start a race who turned and noticed a new opponent, a &ldquo;huge person who was a guy recently.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>Trump paused for effect and then reflected</b> on the fraught nature of his commentary. &ldquo;See? I&rsquo;m politically correct, I said &lsquo;recently,&rsquo; They can&rsquo;t get me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have to be very careful, this is a hornet&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>He continued.</b> He said the trans woman set a new record that would stand until &ldquo;some guy comes along and breaks it again.&rdquo; He pantomimed his way through a story mocking trans women in weightlifting competitions. He imagined himself as a women&rsquo;s basketball team coach recruiting players, such as <b>LEBRON JAMES</b>: &ldquo;Did you ever have any thoughts, LeBron, about one day becoming a woman?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>He congratulated himself.</b> &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s afraid of not being politically correct,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one that talks about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>These long riffs mocking trans athletes </b>were received with thunderous applause. The only other objects of derision that tickled the crowd with similar enthusiasm were mentions of undocumented immigrants or Cheney and the appearance of House Minority Leader <b>KEVIN MCCARTHY</b>, who was booed when he showed up in a video at the rally.</p>\n<p><b>Trump is wrong that he&rsquo;s the only one in politics</b> caricaturing trans people for political benefit. Transgender women have been allowed to compete in women&rsquo;s categories in the Olympics since 2003 and the NCAA since 2010. Yet Republicans say new laws are needed to protect women's sports and GOP candidates have been using Trump-like language in campaigns and policy around the country for years.</p>\n<p><b>It&rsquo;s having an impact.</b> Here in Wyoming last week, <a href=\"https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/lander-schools-cut-sexual-orientation-gender-veteran-status-from-non-discrimination-policy/article_37e53fae-daef-11ec-812e-0bb4abfae37d.html\">a local school board voted</a> to remove sexual orientation and gender identity from its non-discrimination code.</p>\n<p><b>Trump is like a standup comedian.</b> He uses rallies, especially in the offseason, to work on material. He tests the reaction among his diehard fans and watches the mainstream media&rsquo;s coverage. He then rewrites the lines, calibrating them for maximum effect inside the arena and minimal blowback outside of it. You can tell he believes he&rsquo;s onto something with his mocking of trans people.</p>\n<p><b>There is a cynical strategy at work here. </b>Targeting marginalized groups for ridicule forces more responsible actors to stand up for them. As Democrats have learned, Trump&rsquo;s goal is to get them to spend their time outraged and defending the targets of his attacks rather than talking about their own message.</p>\n<p><b>This dynamic creates a built-in political advantage</b> to any party that no longer sees it as taboo to scapegoat certain groups. Trump, of course, knows this and he has found a new target for 2022 &mdash; and perhaps beyond.</p>\n<p><b>Good Sunday morning. </b>Thanks for reading Playbook.

HOW GUNS GET SOLD:</b> In the wake of the shooting, more attention is now turning to the manufacturer of the gun, Georgia-based Daniel Defense, that the shooter used: &ldquo;The company was an early adopter of a direct-to-consumer business model that aimed to make buying military gear as simple as ordering from Amazon, enticing customers with &lsquo;adventure now, pay later&rsquo; installment plans that make expensive weaponry more affordable,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/28/us/texas-school-shooting/uvalde-shooting-puts-focus-on-manufacturer-of-military-style-rifle-used-by-gunman?smid=url-share\">NYT&rsquo;s David Yaffe-Bellany and Jessica Silver-Greenberg write</a>.</p>\n<p><b>3.

Most recently, this trend was on display in <b>DOUG MASTRIANO&rsquo;s</b> victory in the Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial primary (though he rejects the label). So what is it? Experts say &ldquo;Christian nationalism&rdquo; is &ldquo;often accompanied by a belief that God has destined America, like the biblical Israel, for a special role in history, and that it will receive divine blessing or judgment depending on its obedience. That often overlaps with the conservative Christian political agenda, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and transgender rights.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>7.

It was ostensibly a speech in support of HARRIET HAGEMAN, his hand-picked candidate to take out Rep. LIZ CHENEY (R-Wyo.) in what Trump described here as â€œthe most important electionâ€� of 2022 â€” and one that comes after a string of embarrassing primary defeats for Trumpâ€™s picks in Nebraska, Idaho, Georgia and North Carolina.\nTrump meandered into issues far afield from the Wyoming race. In fact, if you havenâ€™t tuned in lately, little has changed at a Trump rally. The former president appears to have put put on some weight, but he still looks younger than his 75 years, and the familiar mix of exaggerations, lies, sometimes hilarious mockery, dark conspiracies, personal grievances, perplexing asides, stream of consciousness riffs â€” all delivered in his uniform of a blue suit and long red tie â€” remains unchanged.\nHow much the event benefited Hageman was unclear. The parking lot was filled with license plates from Idaho, South Dakota, Montana, Colorado and Utah. On the security lines and in the hall, fans costumed in red ties, bedazzled MAGA dresses and at least one Trump-inspired catsuit traded notes on how many Trump rallies theyâ€™ve attended across the country.\nNumerous non-Wyoming MAGA celebrities, such as Rep. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-Colo.), who appeared before Trump, repeatedly pronounced Hagemanâ€™s name incorrectly.\nAs his recent losses make clear, Trump seems to understand now that people come to see him, and may ignore whatever candidate heâ€™s hawking that day. â€œWhatâ€™s more fun than a Trump rally?â€� he asked. The crowd cheered.\nAfter an hour of Trump delivering many familiar hits â€” on Russia, impeachment, Jan. 6, the 2020 election, how he told NATO members he would not defend them if they didnâ€™t â€œpay,â€� trade with China, CHUCK TODDâ€™S alleged lack of sleep, the relative merits of the journalists CHRIS WALLACE and his father MIKE, his conversations with the Taliban, the Durham investigation, and how, â€œsadly,â€� White House physician-turned-congressional candidate RONNY JACKSON knows Trumpâ€™s body better than MELANIA does â€” Trump turned his attention to a newer obsession.\nâ€œNo teacher should ever be allowed to teach transgender to our children without parental consent,â€� he said, just as some of the MAGA faithful started to trickle out. â€œCan you imagine?â€�\nOn the perimeter of the arena, some attendees headed for their cars stopped and began listening again on an outside monitor. Trump briefly got distracted when he caught a glimpse of himself on a video screen and noticed his hair was thinning in the back.\nBut he then returned to the subject.\nâ€œWe will save our kids and we will also keep men the hell out of womenâ€™s sports. Is that OK?â€� he said, using whatâ€™s become a common GOP refrain. He continued with an animated tale about a female swimmer about to start a race who turned and noticed a new opponent, a â€œhuge person who was a guy recently.â€�\nTrump paused for effect and then reflected on the fraught nature of his commentary. â€œSee? Iâ€™m politically correct, I said â€˜recently,â€™ They canâ€™t get me,â€� he said. â€œYou have to be very careful, this is a hornetâ€™s nest.â€�\nHe continued. He said the trans woman set a new record that would stand until â€œsome guy comes along and breaks it again.â€� He pantomimed his way through a story mocking trans women in weightlifting competitions. He imagined himself as a womenâ€™s basketball team coach recruiting players, such as LEBRON JAMES: â€œDid you ever have any thoughts, LeBron, about one day becoming a woman?â€�\nHe congratulated himself. â€œEverybodyâ€™s afraid of not being politically correct,â€� he said. â€œIâ€™m the only one that talks about it.â€�\nThese long riffs mocking trans athletes were received with thunderous applause. The only other objects of derision that tickled the crowd with similar enthusiasm were mentions of undocumented immigrants or Cheney and the appearance of House Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY, who was booed when he showed up in a video at the rally.\nTrump is wrong that heâ€™s the only one in politics caricaturing trans people for political benefit. Transgender women have been allowed to compete in womenâ€™s categories in the Olympics since 2003 and the NCAA since 2010. Yet Republicans say new laws are needed to protect women's sports and GOP candidates have been using Trump-like language in campaigns and policy around the country for years.\nItâ€™s having an impact. Here in Wyoming last week, a local school board voted to remove sexual orientation and gender identity from its non-discrimination code.\nTrump is like a standup comedian. He uses rallies, especially in the offseason, to work on material. He tests the reaction among his diehard fans and watches the mainstream mediaâ€™s coverage. He then rewrites the lines, calibrating them for maximum effect inside the arena and minimal blowback outside of it. You can tell he believes heâ€™s onto something with his mocking of trans people.\nThere is a cynical strategy at work here. Targeting marginalized groups for ridicule forces more responsible actors to stand up for them. As Democrats have learned, Trumpâ€™s goal is to get them to spend their time outraged and defending the targets of his attacks rather than talking about their own message.\nThis dynamic creates a built-in political advantage to any party that no longer sees it as taboo to scapegoat certain groups. Trump, of course, knows this and he has found a new target for 2022 â€” and perhaps beyond.\nGood Sunday morning. Thanks for reading Playbook. Drop us a line: Rachael Bade, Eugene Daniels, Ryan Lizza.\nSUNDAY BEST â€¦\nâ€” Sen. CHRIS MURPHY (D-Conn.) on gun safety legislation negotiations, on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€�: â€œIâ€™m at the table in a more significant way right now with Republicans and Democrats than ever before. â€¦ Every single time after one of these mass shootings, thereâ€™s talks in Washington, and they never succeed. But there are more Republicans interested in talking about finding a path forward this time than I have ever seen since Sandy Hook.â€� More from David Cohen\nâ€” Texas Democratic state Sen. ROLAND GUTIERREZ, who represents Uvalde, on how hopeful he is for legislative changes, on â€œState of the Unionâ€�: â€œIf I do nothing for the rest of my career but yell at Greg Abbott and others that are not willing to listen, then that's what I'm going to do. We must have change. I have spent time with many of these families. And this is just heartbreaking. I just cannot do this anymore. It is heartbreaking. No family should go through what these people are going through.â€�\nâ€” Rep. MO BROOKS (R-Ala.) on whether he would testify before the Jan. 6 select committee, on â€œFox News Sundayâ€�: â€œItâ€™s got to be something that you at Fox News can have a camera on so that the American people can see it. â€¦ OK, itâ€™s got to be in public. Itâ€™s got to be congressman to congressman. Itâ€™s got to be limited to issues associated with Jan. 6 and it has to be after this Senate primary is over with. I donâ€™t want this witch hunt committee, NANCY PELOSI, trying to interfere with a Republican primary election for the United States Senate in Alabama.â€�\nBIDENâ€™S SUNDAY (all times Eastern):\nâ€” 12 p.m.: The president and first lady JILL BIDEN will arrive in Uvalde, Texas.\nâ€” 12:30 p.m.: The Bidens will pay respects to the victims at the memorial site at Robb Elementary School.\nâ€” 1 p.m.: The Bidens will attend mass.\nâ€” 2:30 p.m.: The Bidens will meet with the families of victims and survivors.\nâ€” 6:05 p.m.: The Bidens will meet with first responders.\nâ€” 7 p.m.: The Bidens will depart Uvalde to return to New Castle, Del., where they are scheduled to arrive at 11 p.m.\nVP KAMALA HARRISâ€™ SUNDAY â€” The VP has nothing on her public schedule.\nPHOTO OF THE DAY\nPLAYBOOK READS\n9 (GIVE OR TAKE) STORIES YOU SHOULD BE READING â€¦\n1. THE UVALDE TIMELINE: WaPo, NYT and CNN have harrowing recountings of the shooting at Robb Elementary School on Tuesday â€” detailing the events inside and outside the building minute by minute as they unfolded. Theyâ€™re well worth your time, though we will warn: the details can be very difficult to read.\nâ€” WaPoâ€™s Tim Craig, Hannah Allam, Annie Gowen and Mark Berman write: â€œOnly now, a more reliable chronology is emerging through official statements, 911 logs, social media posts, and interviews with survivors and witnesses. The revelations tell a story of institutional failure at the expense of unprotected children. Here in Uvalde, there is little expectation that correcting the record will lead to any real policy change, especially with hyperpartisan midterm elections looming.â€�\nâ€” NYTâ€™s Keith Collins, Albert Sun, Eleanor Lutz and Larry Buchanan: â€œWhat follows is an account of each of those 78 minutes, as told by video evidence, statements by witnesses and law enforcement, and accounts of 911 calls.â€�\nâ€” CNNâ€™s Ray Sanchez: â€œâ€˜These are our children.â€™ 80 minutes of horror at Robb Elementary Schoolâ€�\nâ€” Related read: â€œâ€˜Ariely is in there,â€™â€� by WaPoâ€™s Peter Jamison: â€œOne daughter left Robb Elementary early. Another was trapped inside the school. A motherâ€™s desperate search, and a familyâ€™s struggle to move forward.â€�\n2. HOW GUNS GET SOLD: In the wake of the shooting, more attention is now turning to the manufacturer of the gun, Georgia-based Daniel Defense, that the shooter used: â€œThe company was an early adopter of a direct-to-consumer business model that aimed to make buying military gear as simple as ordering from Amazon, enticing customers with â€˜adventure now, pay laterâ€™ installment plans that make expensive weaponry more affordable,â€� NYTâ€™s David Yaffe-Bellany and Jessica Silver-Greenberg write.\n3. HISTORY LESSON: After the 2018 Parkland, Fla., mass shooting, Republicans in the state bucked the gun lobby and did the unexpected to pass meaningful gun safety legislation. â€œIn a different political reality, what worked in Florida â€” a huge center-right state that is often seen as a bellwether of national political trends â€” might well be seen as a template for a national compromise to address mass acts of gun violence, such as Tuesdayâ€™s shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Yet itâ€™s not. Interviews this week with Republican senators revealed little stomach for the sort of sprawling bill that Florida Republicans passed in 2018,â€� WaPoâ€™s Mike DeBonis writes.\nâ€” To wit: â€œInside Mitch McConnellâ€™s decades-long effort to block gun control,â€� by WaPoâ€™s Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer\n4. GEORGIA ON MY MIND: Now that HERSCHEL WALKER has officially picked up the GOP nomination in the closely watched Georgia Senate race, both parties are watching everything the candidate says in much harsher light. And some of his comments, particularly on gun safety legislation, since the primary have made Republicans concerned â€” and given Democrats an opening to go after him. â€œIf his runaway primary victory offered a glimpse at his promise as a Senate candidate, then Walkerâ€™s answer on guns was a fresh reminder of his risks as GOP nominee in one of the Senateâ€™s most pivotal races,â€� Brittany Gibson writes.\n5. FAMILY BUSINESS: Sen. BOB MENENDEZ (D-N.J.) is playing favorites. â€œ[W]ith his old ally Rep. ALBIO SIRES (D-NJ) retiring this year from the congressional district encompassing the countyâ€™s major population centers â€” the district the senator himself represented between 1993 and 2006 â€” Menendez appears to have decided his son and namesake must replace him. And the Democratic Party appears to have been doing his bidding,â€� The Daily Beastâ€™s William Bredderman reports.\n6. CHURCH AND STATE:APâ€™s Peter Smith and Deepa Bharath are up with a story this morning examining the rise of Christian nationalism on the campaign trail. Most recently, this trend was on display in DOUG MASTRIANOâ€™s victory in the Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial primary (though he rejects the label). So what is it? Experts say â€œChristian nationalismâ€� is â€œoften accompanied by a belief that God has destined America, like the biblical Israel, for a special role in history, and that it will receive divine blessing or judgment depending on its obedience. That often overlaps with the conservative Christian political agenda, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and transgender rights.â€�\n7. THE STEP BACK: â€œWhat is Americaâ€™s end-game for the war in Ukraine?â€� by FTâ€™s Felicia Schwartz in Washington and Amy Kazmin in Rome: â€œ[B]ehind the confident rhetoric, there is much less clarity about what Washington actually believes can and should happen in Ukraine. There is little detail about what a strategic defeat for Russia would actually look like or what sort of territorial settlement the US might end up encouraging the Ukrainians to accept.â€�\n8. VISUAL STORY: â€œDespite Dangers, More Migrants Attempt Sea Crossings to U.S.â€� by WSJâ€™s Alicia Caldwell and Arian Campo-Flores\n9. THE NEW GOP: When Rep. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-Texas) came to Congress, he was a bit of an outlier, staking out far-right positions that many of the establishment in the party wouldnâ€™t touch. Now, Gohmert has more than a few fellow far-right colleagues â€” but he and a handful of others are on their way out. And the races to succeed them will â€œhelp determine whether [Rep. MARJORIE TAYLOR] GREENE ends up with more agitator allies or if their numbers will be small enough that GOP leaders can avoid kowtowing to their purity demands,â€� WaPoâ€™s Paul Kane writes. â€œSo far this spring, the GOPâ€™s governing wing has had some success.â€�\nPLAYBOOKERS\nA member of Indivisible Houston confronted Ted Cruz at dinner on Friday night over gun safety reform after pretending to pose for a photo with the senator.

In Ohio, the GOP nominee, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/j-d-vance-2/\">J.D. Vance </a>flipped from a Trump critic to Trump cheerleader; on Ukraine, he charged that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/biden/\">Biden </a>sought a conflict with Vladimir Putin because the Russian <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/21/jd-vance/jd-vance-says-transgender-rights-drives-looming-co/\">didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;believe in transgender rights.&rdquo;</a> In North Carolina, Republican candidate Rep. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/ted-budd/\">Ted Budd,</a> a gun shop owner, has embraced Republican Senate campaign chair <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/rick-scott/\">Rick Scott&rsquo;s </a>economic plan, which would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/11/yes-voters-deserve-know-this-gop-plan-would-raise-taxes-by-1-trillion/\">boost taxes</a> on some lower- and middle-class Americans and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/11/yes-voters-deserve-know-this-gop-plan-would-raise-taxes-by-1-trillion/\">sunset Social Security and Medicare</a> every five years.</p>\n<p>The Democratic edge in candidates in these two states could be offset by conditions and the advantage the GOP usually enjoys in these states in off-year elections.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania is in such chaos any forecast is impossible. Two Republicans &mdash; celebrity doctor <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/mehmet-oz/\">Mehmet Oz </a>and hedge fund executive <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/david-mccormick/\">David McCormick </a>&mdash; virtually tied in the primary and now face a contentious recount; legal squabbles could stretch out for weeks, even months. In 1964 a similar situation on the Democratic side lasted until late August; in a year in which President Lyndon Johnson won the state in a landslide, Republicans barely carried the Senate seat.</p>\n<p>The maverick Democrat, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/people/john-fetterman/\">John Fetterman,</a> won a huge primary victory; however, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/health/fetterman-stroke-senate-campaign.html\">suffered a stroke four days before the election</a>, and the campaign has not been transparent about his condition.</p>\n<p>The slim Democratic hopes for retaining the House majority vanished with the latest redistricting. A Democratic gerrymandering in New York was thrown out by the state courts, while a Republican gerrymandering slipped by in Ohio, in part due to a legal blunder by Democrats.</p>\n<p>The upshot, including few other states, says David Wasserman of the Cook Report and the expert on Congressional elections, is &ldquo;a swing of seven or eight seats&rdquo; for the GOP.

However, with raging inflation, high gas prices and President Bidenâ€™s low approval numbers â€” and given the historical pattern of midterm setbacks for the party that controls the White House â€” better candidates may not much matter.\nRepublicans seem almost certain to take back the House, where the Democrats hold an edge of only five seats. The GOP advantages in gerrymandered redistricting alone makes up that difference.\nThere are four Democratic-held Senate seats under challenge.\nNew Hampshireâ€™s Sen. Maggie Hassan got a break when popular Gov. Chris Sununu decided not to run.\nNevadaâ€™s Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough challenge from Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt.\nGeorgiaâ€™s Raphael Warnock, the pastor at Martin Luther Kingâ€™s church, has proven an effective Senator and fund-raiser; his opponent, former Georgia football great Herschel Walker has been embroiled in personal controversies, shows little grasp of issues and has been caught in lies. The race still is close.\nArizonaâ€™s Mark Kelly also has made a mark and is a prolific fund-raiser. None of his possible Republican opponents â€” the GOP primary is Aug. 2 â€” would be confused with the iconic late Sen. John McCain. One, in an Easter ad, depicted himself as a savior; another raised the possibility of banning contraceptives, and the current Attorney General, pandering to Trump, continues to peddle the disproven charge of voter fraud in 2020.\nIf Democrats lose one or two of these seats, Democrats will need to win a couple Republican-held seats.\nOne Republican incumbent in deep trouble is Wisconsinâ€™s Ron Johnson, whose poll numbers are terrible. The question is can Democrats nominate a more appealing challenger on Aug. 9?\nTwo states that went for Trump â€” Ohio and North Carolina â€” have strong Democratic candidates: Rep. Tim Ryan in the Buckeye state and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley in North Carolina. In Ohio, the GOP nominee, J.D. Vance flipped from a Trump critic to Trump cheerleader; on Ukraine, he charged that Biden sought a conflict with Vladimir Putin because the Russian didnâ€™t â€œbelieve in transgender rights.â€� In North Carolina, Republican candidate Rep. Ted Budd, a gun shop owner, has embraced Republican Senate campaign chair Rick Scottâ€™s economic plan, which would boost taxes on some lower- and middle-class Americans and sunset Social Security and Medicare every five years.\nThe Democratic edge in candidates in these two states could be offset by conditions and the advantage the GOP usually enjoys in these states in off-year elections.\nPennsylvania is in such chaos any forecast is impossible. Two Republicans â€” celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz and hedge fund executive David McCormick â€” virtually tied in the primary and now face a contentious recount; legal squabbles could stretch out for weeks, even months. In 1964 a similar situation on the Democratic side lasted until late August; in a year in which President Lyndon Johnson won the state in a landslide, Republicans barely carried the Senate seat.\nThe maverick Democrat, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, won a huge primary victory; however, he suffered a stroke four days before the election, and the campaign has not been transparent about his condition.\nThe slim Democratic hopes for retaining the House majority vanished with the latest redistricting. A Democratic gerrymandering in New York was thrown out by the state courts, while a Republican gerrymandering slipped by in Ohio, in part due to a legal blunder by Democrats.\nThe upshot, including few other states, says David Wasserman of the Cook Report and the expert on Congressional elections, is â€œa swing of seven or eight seatsâ€� for the GOP. Wasserman now predicts a GOP gain of 20 to 35 House seats in November.\nOne striking illustration is in Ohio. In Toledo, Republicans gerrymandered Democratic Rep. Marcy Kapturâ€™s district from one that Biden carried by 19 points to one that Trump won. Kaptur now faces a serious challenge from Jason Majewski, who attended the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, painted a huge picture of Donald Trump on his front yard and embraces the nutty QAnon conspiracy theories.\nThe bottom line for Democrats: If by October, inflation declines to 5 percent or less (about the same as the growth rate in wages) and Bidenâ€™s job approval moves above the low 40s (possible only if other Democrats start talking about what he has accomplished rather than what he hasnâ€™t done) they have a shot â€” with better candidates â€” to hold the Senate.\nThere is no margin for error.\nAl Hunt is the former executive editor of Bloomberg News.

Though he invested inordinate time and spiteful energy in the task of purging Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who together committed the cardinal sin of certifying Joe Biden&rsquo;s 2020 victory in the Peach State, the <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/kemp-trounces-trumps-guy-perdue-and-raffensperger-survives.html\">45th president got his butt kicked</a> on May 24. There&rsquo;s really no other way to put it.</p>\n<p>Trump personally handpicked the instruments of his revenge, talking former U.S. senator <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/trump-ignites-republican-civil-war-in-georgia.html\">David Perdue</a> out of retirement to take down Kemp and convincing <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/trumpy-georgia-congressman-mulls-raffensperger-challenge.html\">Jody Hice</a> to give up a safe congressional seat to dispose of Raffensperger.

He took 67 percent of the vote in Perdue&rsquo;s home county and 75 percent in the home county of ultra-MAGA Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. And even more remarkably, Raffensperger, <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/georgias-brad-raffensperger-fears-future-election-violence.html\">written off</a> as a sure loser by most observers from the get-go, beat Hice and two other opponents without a runoff.</p>\n<p>Yes, there were some silver linings in the Georgia results for Trump. His Senate candidate Herschel Walker <a href=\"https://time.com/6181171/herschel-walker-georgia-republican-senate/\">won easily</a>, not that there was a shred of doubt about it going in. Indeed, the only surprise in Walker&rsquo;s race was that he ran well behind Kemp despite opposition so weak that the former football star ignored his rivals. Trump&rsquo;s candidate for lieutenant governor seems to have <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2022/05/25/burt-jones-victory-georgia-lieutenant-governor-primary\">won without a runoff</a>. Two of his congressional endorsees in competitive primaries made runoffs, albeit in second place.</p>\n<p>But the Kemp victory in particular leaves the ex-president in a quandary. He&rsquo;s said so very many hateful things about the incumbent governor before and during the primary campaign that he cannot just endorse his general election candidacy like nothing happened.

Though he invested inordinate time and spiteful energy in the task of purging Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who together committed the cardinal sin of certifying Joe Bidenâ€™s 2020 victory in the Peach State, the 45th president got his butt kicked on May 24. Thereâ€™s really no other way to put it.\nTrump personally handpicked the instruments of his revenge, talking former U.S. senator David Perdue out of retirement to take down Kemp and convincing Jody Hice to give up a safe congressional seat to dispose of Raffensperger. Kemp routed Perdue on an epic scale, beating him 74-22 and winning all 159 counties. He took 67 percent of the vote in Perdueâ€™s home county and 75 percent in the home county of ultra-MAGA Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. And even more remarkably, Raffensperger, written off as a sure loser by most observers from the get-go, beat Hice and two other opponents without a runoff.\nYes, there were some silver linings in the Georgia results for Trump. His Senate candidate Herschel Walker won easily, not that there was a shred of doubt about it going in. Indeed, the only surprise in Walkerâ€™s race was that he ran well behind Kemp despite opposition so weak that the former football star ignored his rivals. Trumpâ€™s candidate for lieutenant governor seems to have won without a runoff. Two of his congressional endorsees in competitive primaries made runoffs, albeit in second place.\nBut the Kemp victory in particular leaves the ex-president in a quandary. Heâ€™s said so very many hateful things about the incumbent governor before and during the primary campaign that he cannot just endorse his general election candidacy like nothing happened. On the eve of the primary, he pushed back against reports that he had given up on Perdue by labeling Kemp â€œthe worst election integrity governor in the country.â€� But his grudge against Kemp goes back long before their disagreements over the 2020 outcome to a dispute over COVID-19 measures in Georgia, and before that, to Kempâ€™s dismissal of Trumpâ€™s request that he reward a loyal ally with an appointment to an open U.S. Senate seat.\nMore generally, Trump maintained that Kemp owed his governorship to an endorsement the then-president gave him during the GOP primary four years ago, saying, â€œHe would be nothing without me.â€� Kemp, who knew he would have almost certainly won in 2018 without Trumpâ€™s endorsement, has reciprocated his disdain, telling a reporter that when Trump pressured him to call a special session to â€œauditâ€� Bidenâ€™s win in December of 2020, â€œI didnâ€™t give a shit what he had to say.â€�\nThese are two fierce right-wing warriors (Kemp likes to call himself a â€œpolitically incorrect conservativeâ€�) with competing egos and plenty of simmering resentments.\nSo Trump may sit on his hands for a good while and Kemp may bask in his ability to win MAGA voters without a blessing from Mar-a-Lago.\nBut there will be a lot of pressure on both men to kiss and make up in order to provide party unity in the general-election struggle ahead. David Perdue, for his part, endorsed Kemp in his concession speech, citing the importance of making common cause to defeat Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams.\nIt will be a common sentiment among Republicans, who tend to think of Abrams as sort of a combination of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama; they both loath and grudgingly respect the skills that made her in 2018 the most successful Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 20 years. And Abrams and Kemp have their own grudge match going; it ties back to Abramsâ€™s efforts to register low-income and minority voters and Kempâ€™s efforts as secretary of State to stop her. Perhaps the deadliest insult Trump has ever fired at Kemp was his suggestion last autumn that Abrams might be a better governor than her 2018 opponent.\nIn weighing whether to swallow his towering pride and put on the party harness, Trump must acknowledge that his Senate candidate Walkerâ€™s fate in taking on incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock is tied to Kempâ€™s. And if the ex-president cares at all about his image in what will likely be a key 2024 battleground state, he must keep in mind the blame so many Georgia Republicans quietly assign to him for the loss of two U.S. Senate seats that gave Democrats a governing trifecta. In the lead-up to the January 2021 runoff, Trump couldnâ€™t stop complaining about Georgiaâ€™s â€œriggedâ€� election machinery, which dampened GOP turnout.\nLuckily for Republicans, Trump now has over five months to get over his pique. But time certainly hasnâ€™t helped the 45th president forget about the (perceived) injustice he suffered at the hands of Georgia voters in 2020.","categories":[{"score":0.918,"name":"News and Politics","id":"iabv2-379"}],"summary":"Three days after the smoke cleared from Georgiaâ€™s 2022 Republican primary, Donald Trump has a proble...","image":"https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/854/5d4/f60e3d6d27969ada45a5901903bdf92ba5-kemp-trump.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg","types":["Article","GlobalIndexDiffbotEntity"],"images":[{"summary":"","image":"https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/854/5d4/f60e3d6d27969ada45a5901903bdf92ba5-kemp-trump.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg","naturalHeight":630,"name":"","url":"https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/854/5d4/f60e3d6d27969ada45a5901903bdf92ba5-kemp-trump.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg","naturalWidth":1200}],"author":"Ed Kilgore","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/ART252855949326","tags":[{"score":0.99954635,"sentiment":-0.826,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":33,"label":"Donald Trump","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EY1mA3TomNVWxY0sLifAwEQ"},{"score":0.99612623,"sentiment":-0.634,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":8,"label":"Georgia","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E_L-1Z6pbMUuEvXV5RpTMaQ"},{"score":0.98786,"sentiment":-0.835,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty"],"count":3,"label":"Republican Party","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EQux7TYFDMgO6n_OByeSXzg"},{"score":0.965756,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":2,"label":"Joe Biden","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E4TlFcudMNuaX0eYAWet-8w"},{"score":0.9464948,"sentiment":-0.794,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":33,"label":"Brian Kemp","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EYu86qnLnMJSovrKFbbvdyQ"},{"score":0.91388524,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":8,"label":"Stacey Abrams","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E-CcLNnG4NuON849wzvPBEA"},{"score":0.89827734,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":6,"label":"David Perdue","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EczYBtsVJPuCLiM_VPsp81Q"},{"score":0.892373,"sentiment":-0.454,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":5,"label":"Herschel Walker","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EH68p_DdAPqOhAwCi3cVm7Q"},{"score":0.8478724,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":3,"label":"Brad Raffensperger","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EPcVNYRyVOl2ngg-1FdWLwg"},{"score":0.82802033,"sentiment":0.349,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":1,"label":"Barack Obama","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E0Akwc0aKMKmTclQRNAiwRQ"}],"lastCrawlTime":1653702625,"publisherCountry":"United States","name":"Will Trump Ruin Georgia Republicans Out of Spite?","pageUrl":"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/what-will-trump-do-about-kemp-after-getting-his-ass-kicked.html","resolvedPageUrl":""}},

And part of that is because, as The Onion keeps having to point out, we live in a world where the underlying message is:<em> <a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1848971668\">&lsquo;No Way To Prevent This,&rsquo; Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens</a></em>.</p>\n<p>And that is the most frustrating part of this. There are ways to deal with this. But they&rsquo;re politically infeasible. Democrats focus on what appear to be pretty basic gun control concepts, around background checks, and putting at least some limits on the more extreme weapons out there (i.e., the ones favored in many of these mass murders). Republicans politicians (though, bizarrely, <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release?releaseid=3809\">not the actual voters</a>, outside of a few extremes) refuse to even consider any kind of gun laws. At all.</p>\n<p>Republican talking points have focused on mental health. And, clearly, that is an issue. But it also raises the question: why aren&rsquo;t Republicans then in favor of <em>better, more readily available, mental healthcare for everyone</em>? Or, even more to the point, why are Republicans, who say they&rsquo;re concerned about mental healthcare, unwilling to consider gun laws that might keep guns out of the hands of those who are at risk of committing a mass murder?</p>\n<p>And, Democrats, being feckless and incompetent as always, take all of their talking points and focus by letting Republicans frame the debate entirely, always on the defensive, and rarely, if ever, making even the slightest attempt to frame things in a positive manner. It&rsquo;s always just pushing back on Republican&rsquo;s and their dishonest framing.</p>\n<p>Both parties deserve each other, but neither seems to want to explore actual solutions.</p>\n<p>And thus, they&rsquo;re converging on the same nonsense: blame social media.</p>\n<p>We saw it in New York, where it&rsquo;s now clear there were multiple levels of government failings that contributed to the situation in Buffalo, but where the Governor and the Attorney General have decided it was <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/19/nys-attorney-general-launches-ridiculous-blatantly-unconstitutional-investigations-into-websites-the-buffalo-shooter-used/\">easier to blame social media</a> than to tackle the real issues related to a racist teenager deciding to commit mass murder.</p>\n<p>And, now we&rsquo;re seeing people trying to do the same regarding the equally horrifying mass murder (of children!) in Texas.

The framing of the debate means <em>actual</em> solutions are off the table. I mean, anyone who even mentions guns is accused of &ldquo;politicizing&rdquo; tragedy. So, it&rsquo;s easy as a kind of venting to focus anger and blame on the tech industry at a moment when the media narrative has been already beating up on that industry from every direction. So why not just blame mass murder on it as well?</p>\n<p>To be clear, I actually think the meat of the Washington Post article is fairly balanced, and it includes comments from smart people highlighting that these services have been mostly incredibly powerful in useful ways for people. But, it just feels like the frustration about not being able to do anything about the bigger issues &mdash; guns and mental health &mdash; means everyone is converging on the current favorite punching bag: social media.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://deals.techdirt.com/sales/the-2022-cisco-certified-technician-training-prep-bundle?utm_source=&utm_medium=js-dealfeed&utm_content=&utm_campaign=the-2022-cisco-certified-technician-training-prep-bundle\"><img alt=\"The 2022 Cisco Certified Technician Training Prep Bundle\" data-src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/5cf7418fdd1bd345d462efc5a448ab78441d38eb/store/opt/360/270/e1ef5099f625a84647edfa9e40fc0d0b6e881370a7e4fb5bc0723072ba63/sale_312938_primary_image.jpg\" src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/5cf7418fdd1bd345d462efc5a448ab78441d38eb/store/opt/360/270/e1ef5099f625a84647edfa9e40fc0d0b6e881370a7e4fb5bc0723072ba63/sale_312938_primary_image.jpg\"></img></a></figure>","id":"ART78708012526","text":"from the scapegoats-are-not-good-policymaking dept\nThe recent mass murders in Buffalo and Uvalde are sickening, horrifying, and extraordinarily frustrating.

At all.</p>\n<p>Republican talking points have focused on mental health. And, clearly, that is an issue. But it also raises the question: why aren&rsquo;t Republicans then in favor of <em>better, more readily available, mental healthcare for everyone</em>? Or, even more to the point, why are Republicans, who say they&rsquo;re concerned about mental healthcare, unwilling to consider gun laws that might keep guns out of the hands of those who are at risk of committing a mass murder?</p>\n<p>And, Democrats, being feckless and incompetent as always, take all of their talking points and focus by letting Republicans frame the debate entirely, always on the defensive, and rarely, if ever, making even the slightest attempt to frame things in a positive manner.

But that doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>any</em> solution is a good solution. Unfortunately, Senator Amy Klobuchar, whenever given the option, seems to put forth <em>the worst</em> possible plan. It&rsquo;s mind boggling.</p>\n<p>For a while now, Klobuchar, along with Senator Chuck Grassley, have been pushing their American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA). It&rsquo;s got a fair bit of support, including from companies and organizations I often agree with on the issues. But, this bill has serious problems. Many of us raised concerns about those problems, and even made suggestions on how to fix the problems. There are ways to create a bill that would target the <em>actual</em> bad practices of internet companies. But this isn&rsquo;t it.</p>\n<p>For a few months, Klobuchar has apparently been working on a new and improved version of the bill, which was <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22038730/b1f51354e81beff3eb96956a7a5e1d6asil22713.pdf\">revealed last night</a>. Somewhat incredibly, it fixes none of the problems people raised. The major change: <strong>making sure it doesn&rsquo;t apply to telcos</strong> <strong>and financial companies.</strong></p>\n<p>I only wish I were joking. Of course, this is the same Klobuchar who, on a different antitrust bill, made sure to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/09/klobuchar-cotton-competition-bill-latest-to-pretend-big-tech-is-only-industry-with-problems/\">carve out her state&rsquo;s largest employer</a>, Target. So, we get it. Klobuchar cares more about making the lobbyists and specific industries happy than tackling the real problems of her bill. It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>\n<p>The main &ldquo;focus&rdquo; of the bill is that it&rsquo;s supposed to bar certain large companies from preferencing their own products. So, for example, Yelp has spent over a decade <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2014/10/02/even-if-google-could-improve-its-recommendations-is-it-governments-job-to-tell-them-to-do-so/\">whining</a> that Google showed people the results of its own Local search, crowding Yelp results out of search. The bill is designed to say that companies can&rsquo;t do that any more. Of course, there are legitimate concerns that this will mean certain companies sending people to very useful products that people actually like <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/02/02/can-we-least-make-sure-antitrust-isnt-deliberately-designed-to-make-everyone-worse-off/\">will violate this bill</a>. The quintessential example of this: when doing a search on a location, Google can point you to Google Maps. But, under this bill, that would be problematic.</p>\n<p>To us, the biggest concern has been how this bill actually is <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/15/if-david-cicilline-gets-his-way-it-would-destroy-content-moderation/\">a content moderation ban in disguise</a>. It says that covered companies cannot:</p>\n<blockquote> <p><em>discriminate in the application or enforcement of the terms of service of the covered platform among similarly situated business users in a manner that would materially harm competition;</em></p> </blockquote>\n<p>So, Amazon telling Parler that it violates AWS&rsquo; terms of service and <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2021/01/15/few-more-thoughts-total-deplatforming-parler-infrastructure-content-moderation/\">booting it off the service</a>? That would not be allowed under this bill. Remember, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2021/01/13/parlers-laughably-bad-antitrust-lawsuit-against-amazon/\">Parler sued Amazon</a>, and a key part of their initial claims was that because Amazon treated Twitter differently than Parler (which wasn&rsquo;t true at the time, as Twitter had only just signed a deal to use AWS but wasn&rsquo;t on it yet), that it was anticompetitive for Amazon to remove Parler. The judge in that case <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2021/01/21/judge-easily-rejects-parlers-demands-to-have-amazon-reinstate-parler/\">was not impressed</a>, but if AICOA becomes law, suddenly we&rsquo;re going to see a ton of claims like this in response to moderation choices.</p>\n<p>Tons of companies already love to claim that moderation decisions are about harm to competition. Hell, for many years, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2010/11/30/wait-can-anyone-explain-why-google-should-promote-other-search-engines/\">the main company</a> going after Google for antitrust was a really, really spammy tool called Foundem, that was upset that Google had realized that users hated getting sent to Foundem, and downranked the site. Foundem (apparently funded by Microsoft) spent years insisting this was &ldquo;anticompetitive&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;making search work better by not sending users to spammy sites they don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo; But, again, under AICOA, arguments like that are going to have to be considered by judges.</p>\n<p>Downranking spammy sites and services, or removing sites that ignores terms of service like Parler, now become competition law minefields.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to see how that&rsquo;s good for anyone, other than the operators of sketchy sites.</p>\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted, everyone in the Senate actually knows this. Because the main reason that Klobuchar keeps this nonsense in the bill and doesn&rsquo;t fix the language, is because she knows that this is the only way <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/02/23/gop-knows-that-dems-antitrust-efforts-have-content-moderation-trojan-horse-why-dont-dems/\">to keep Republicans on the bill</a>. Republicans see this content moderation trojan horse in the bill, and are thrilled with it. Because they think it&rsquo;s going to allow lawsuits to protect Parler, Truth Social, and their other also ran websites.</p>\n<p>Remember, Ted Cruz was so excited about this bill because it would, in his words, &ldquo;unleash the trial lawyers&rdquo; to sue Google, Facebook and others for content moderation decisions.</p>\n<p>Republicans are supporting this bill because they know it will be used to hit internet companies with all sorts of lawsuits over their moderation decisions.</p>\n<p>Of course, it appears that some Republicans worried (or, rather, some telco lobbyists told Republicans) that the law might ALSO result in broadband providers facing the same sorts of nonsense lawsuits. Indeed, part of the original bill <em>could</em> have been read as a kind of net neutrality bill in disguise, because larger ISPs would be barred from similarly &ldquo;favoring&rdquo; services over others in a way deemed anticompetitive. And you can bet that some telcos that rely on things like zero rating were worried.</p>\n<p>So, that brings us to the major change in this new version of Klobuchar&rsquo;s bill: <strong>she carved out the telcos to make sure the bill doesn&rsquo;t apply to them</strong>. Even though telcos are way more of a competition problem than any online service. Here&rsquo;s some new language in the bill excluding telcos. It explicitly says that the definition of an &ldquo;online platform&rdquo;:</p>\n<blockquote> <p><em>does not include a service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service</em>.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Got it? So, no preferencing. Unless you&rsquo;re the only broadband player in town. Then, go hog-wild, according to Senator Klobuchar.</p>\n<p>Nice work there. That won&rsquo;t make people cynical at all about the political process.</p>\n<p>Of course, once again, this is almost certainly appeasement to Republicans, who, for clear political reasons, want to continue to pretend that telcos are no big deal, and that it&rsquo;s only the big internet providers who are evil.</p>\n<p>It makes no sense at all that Democrats like Amy Klobuchar are playing right into their hands, and giving them everything that they want. But, of course, Klobuchuar has decided for political reasons that she wants to be seen as the senator who took on big tech for her next presidential campaign. And, if that means handing Republicans all the tools they need to file a ton of vexatious lawsuits to try to force companies to enable more hate speech and propaganda, so be it.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s pure cynical opportunism.</p>\n<p>Oh, and also, it looks like financial firms got a little carve out as well. The original bill said the term online platforms would apply to websites that &ldquo;facilitates the offering, advertising, sale, purchase, <strong>payment</strong>, or shipping of products or services&hellip;&rdquo; The new version of the bill covers those that &ldquo;enables the offering, advertising, sale, purchase, or shipping of products or services&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So, the same list <strong>minus payments.</strong></p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s two giant industries &mdash; telcos and banks &mdash; that were able to secure their carveouts. But, no effort to fix any of the actual problems of the bill.</p>\n<p>With the original bill, NERA Economic Consulting had <a href=\"https://www.nera.com/publications/archive/case-project-experience/nera-study-estimates-cost-of-online-platform-and-marketplace-reg.html?utm_source=external\">written up an analysis</a> of companies that would be considered covered platforms in the bill, noting that it directly would hit just six: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and likely TikTok. However, it also noted that there were 13 other companies that were below the size thresholds in the bill, but close enough that they would likely &ldquo;take measure to avoid significant risk incumbent upon exceeding the thresholds.&rdquo; Notably, many of those included broadband companies and financial companies. By my count, the new carve outs in the bill likely cut that list of 13 by at least 7.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-16.png?w=552&ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-16.png?w=552&ssl=1 552w, https://i0.wp.com/www.techdirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-16.png?resize=300%2C149&ssl=1 300w\"></img></figure>\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that some of the others might be excluded as well, though I&rsquo;m not as sure.

And part of that is because, as The Onion keeps having to point out, we live in a world where the underlying message is:<em> <a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1848971668\">&lsquo;No Way To Prevent This,&rsquo; Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens</a></em>.</p>\n<p>And that is the most frustrating part of this. There are ways to deal with this. But they&rsquo;re politically infeasible. Democrats focus on what appear to be pretty basic gun control concepts, around background checks, and putting at least some limits on the more extreme weapons out there (i.e., the ones favored in many of these mass murders). Republicans politicians (though, bizarrely, <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/Poll-Release?releaseid=3809\">not the actual voters</a>, outside of a few extremes) refuse to even consider any kind of gun laws. At all.</p>\n<p>Republican talking points have focused on mental health. And, clearly, that is an issue. But it also raises the question: why aren&rsquo;t Republicans then in favor of <em>better, more readily available, mental healthcare for everyone</em>? Or, even more to the point, why are Republicans, who say they&rsquo;re concerned about mental healthcare, unwilling to consider gun laws that might keep guns out of the hands of those who are at risk of committing a mass murder?</p>\n<p>And, Democrats, being feckless and incompetent as always, take all of their talking points and focus by letting Republicans frame the debate entirely, always on the defensive, and rarely, if ever, making even the slightest attempt to frame things in a positive manner. It&rsquo;s always just pushing back on Republican&rsquo;s and their dishonest framing.</p>\n<p>Both parties deserve each other, but neither seems to want to explore actual solutions.</p>\n<p>And thus, they&rsquo;re converging on the same nonsense: blame social media.</p>\n<p>We saw it in New York, where it&rsquo;s now clear there were multiple levels of government failings that contributed to the situation in Buffalo, but where the Governor and the Attorney General have decided it was <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/19/nys-attorney-general-launches-ridiculous-blatantly-unconstitutional-investigations-into-websites-the-buffalo-shooter-used/\">easier to blame social media</a> than to tackle the real issues related to a racist teenager deciding to commit mass murder.</p>\n<p>And, now we&rsquo;re seeing people trying to do the same regarding the equally horrifying mass murder (of children!) in Texas. US Senate candidate from Georgia, Herschel Walker, (who is not exactly known for coherently talking about anything) went on TV to argue that the answer can&rsquo;t be taking away 2nd Amendment rights, but should be taking away 1st Amendment rights.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-tweet-id=\"1529817124256026624\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=techdirt&dnt=true&embedId=twitter-widget-0&features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3NlbnNpdGl2ZV9tZWRpYV9pbnRlcnN0aXRpYWxfMTM5NjMiOnsiYnVja2V0IjoiaW50ZXJzdGl0aWFsIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH0sInRmd190d2VldF9yZXN1bHRfbWlncmF0aW9uXzEzOTc5Ijp7ImJ1Y2tldCI6InR3ZWV0X3Jlc3VsdCIsInZlcnNpb24iOm51bGx9fQ%3D%3D&frame=false&hideCard=false&hideThread=false&id=1529817124256026624&lang=en&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techdirt.com%2F2022%2F05%2F27%2Fsocial-media-is-the-easy-scapegoat-for-politicians-who-dont-want-to-deal-with-actual-problems%2F&sessionId=f72f3d03aa8b3249fcfffa5faf57e743451a0d2d&siteScreenName=techdirt&theme=light&widgetsVersion=c8fe9736dd6fb%3A1649830956492&width=500px\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>In that video he says:</p>\n<blockquote> <p><em>What we need to do is look into how we can stop those things. You talk about doing the disinformation. What about getting a department that can look at young men that&rsquo;s looking at women that&rsquo;s looking at social media. What about doing that? Looking into things like that? And we can stop things that way. Yet they want to just continue to talk about taking away your Constitutional rights&hellip; </em></p> </blockquote>\n<p>News flash, Herschel: a department that is looking into the speech of people also is taking away constitutional rights. It&rsquo;s the first one. The one before the one you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>\n<p>But, even if you want to dismiss that as Herschel Walker being Herschel Walker, there are more serious conversations that seem to want to keep pointing the finger at social media as well. The Washington Post, for example, has a story covering both mass murders with the title: <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/26/shooters-social-media/\">As young gunmen turn toward new social networks, old safeguards fail</a></em>. And again, it seems to want to suggest there&rsquo;s some sort of blame here:</p>\n<blockquote> <p><em>Both the Uvalde, Texas, shooter and the one in Buffalo, used a combination of disappearing video-app Snapchat, Instagram direct messages, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/24/what-is-discord-faq-safety/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3\">chat-app Discord</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/22/apple-says-its-app-store-is-safe-trusted-place-we-found-reports-unwanted-sexual-behavior-six-apps-some-targeting-minors/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3\">social-app Yubo</a> to meet people and share their violent plans with acquaintances. In the case of the Buffalo shooting, the gunman also used video streaming platform Twitch to publicize his deadly attack.</em></p> </blockquote>\n<p>These apps are communications apps. People communicate with them. It&rsquo;s weird to blame the tools for the actual communications, but that always seems to be the focus.</p>\n<p>And, to some extent, I understand the psychological reasons for this. The framing of the debate means <em>actual</em> solutions are off the table. I mean, anyone who even mentions guns is accused of &ldquo;politicizing&rdquo; tragedy. So, it&rsquo;s easy as a kind of venting to focus anger and blame on the tech industry at a moment when the media narrative has been already beating up on that industry from every direction. So why not just blame mass murder on it as well?</p>\n<p>To be clear, I actually think the meat of the Washington Post article is fairly balanced, and it includes comments from smart people highlighting that these services have been mostly incredibly powerful in useful ways for people. But, it just feels like the frustration about not being able to do anything about the bigger issues &mdash; guns and mental health &mdash; means everyone is converging on the current favorite punching bag: social media.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://deals.techdirt.com/sales/the-2022-cisco-certified-technician-training-prep-bundle?utm_source=&utm_medium=js-dealfeed&utm_content=&utm_campaign=the-2022-cisco-certified-technician-training-prep-bundle\"><img alt=\"The 2022 Cisco Certified Technician Training Prep Bundle\" data-src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/5cf7418fdd1bd345d462efc5a448ab78441d38eb/store/opt/360/270/e1ef5099f625a84647edfa9e40fc0d0b6e881370a7e4fb5bc0723072ba63/sale_312938_primary_image.jpg\" src=\"https://cdnp0.stackassets.com/5cf7418fdd1bd345d462efc5a448ab78441d38eb/store/opt/360/270/e1ef5099f625a84647edfa9e40fc0d0b6e881370a7e4fb5bc0723072ba63/sale_312938_primary_image.jpg\"></img></a></figure>","id":"ART98511304172","text":"from the what-are-we-doing-here? dept\nLook: there are very real issues with the state of the internet today, including the amount of power a few companies have. But that doesnâ€™t mean any solution is a good solution. Unfortunately, Senator Amy Klobuchar, whenever given the option, seems to put forth the worst possible plan. Itâ€™s mind boggling.\nFor a while now, Klobuchar, along with Senator Chuck Grassley, have been pushing their American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA). Itâ€™s got a fair bit of support, including from companies and organizations I often agree with on the issues. But, this bill has serious problems. Many of us raised concerns about those problems, and even made suggestions on how to fix the problems. There are ways to create a bill that would target the actual bad practices of internet companies. But this isnâ€™t it.\nFor a few months, Klobuchar has apparently been working on a new and improved version of the bill, which was revealed last night. Somewhat incredibly, it fixes none of the problems people raised. The major change: making sure it doesnâ€™t apply to telcos and financial companies.\nI only wish I were joking. Of course, this is the same Klobuchar who, on a different antitrust bill, made sure to carve out her stateâ€™s largest employer, Target. So, we get it. Klobuchar cares more about making the lobbyists and specific industries happy than tackling the real problems of her bill. Itâ€™s pathetic.\nThe main â€œfocusâ€� of the bill is that itâ€™s supposed to bar certain large companies from preferencing their own products. So, for example, Yelp has spent over a decade whining that Google showed people the results of its own Local search, crowding Yelp results out of search. The bill is designed to say that companies canâ€™t do that any more. Of course, there are legitimate concerns that this will mean certain companies sending people to very useful products that people actually like will violate this bill. The quintessential example of this: when doing a search on a location, Google can point you to Google Maps. But, under this bill, that would be problematic.\nTo us, the biggest concern has been how this bill actually is a content moderation ban in disguise. It says that covered companies cannot:\ndiscriminate in the application or enforcement of the terms of service of the covered platform among similarly situated business users in a manner that would materially harm competition;\nSo, Amazon telling Parler that it violates AWSâ€™ terms of service and booting it off the service? That would not be allowed under this bill. Remember, Parler sued Amazon, and a key part of their initial claims was that because Amazon treated Twitter differently than Parler (which wasnâ€™t true at the time, as Twitter had only just signed a deal to use AWS but wasnâ€™t on it yet), that it was anticompetitive for Amazon to remove Parler. The judge in that case was not impressed, but if AICOA becomes law, suddenly weâ€™re going to see a ton of claims like this in response to moderation choices.\nTons of companies already love to claim that moderation decisions are about harm to competition. Hell, for many years, the main company going after Google for antitrust was a really, really spammy tool called Foundem, that was upset that Google had realized that users hated getting sent to Foundem, and downranked the site. Foundem (apparently funded by Microsoft) spent years insisting this was â€œanticompetitiveâ€� rather than â€œmaking search work better by not sending users to spammy sites they donâ€™t want.â€� But, again, under AICOA, arguments like that are going to have to be considered by judges.\nDownranking spammy sites and services, or removing sites that ignores terms of service like Parler, now become competition law minefields.\nItâ€™s difficult to see how thatâ€™s good for anyone, other than the operators of sketchy sites.\nAs weâ€™ve noted, everyone in the Senate actually knows this. Because the main reason that Klobuchar keeps this nonsense in the bill and doesnâ€™t fix the language, is because she knows that this is the only way to keep Republicans on the bill. Republicans see this content moderation trojan horse in the bill, and are thrilled with it. Because they think itâ€™s going to allow lawsuits to protect Parler, Truth Social, and their other also ran websites.\nRemember, Ted Cruz was so excited about this bill because it would, in his words, â€œunleash the trial lawyersâ€� to sue Google, Facebook and others for content moderation decisions.\nRepublicans are supporting this bill because they know it will be used to hit internet companies with all sorts of lawsuits over their moderation decisions.\nOf course, it appears that some Republicans worried (or, rather, some telco lobbyists told Republicans) that the law might ALSO result in broadband providers facing the same sorts of nonsense lawsuits. Indeed, part of the original bill could have been read as a kind of net neutrality bill in disguise, because larger ISPs would be barred from similarly â€œfavoringâ€� services over others in a way deemed anticompetitive. And you can bet that some telcos that rely on things like zero rating were worried.\nSo, that brings us to the major change in this new version of Klobucharâ€™s bill: she carved out the telcos to make sure the bill doesnâ€™t apply to them. Even though telcos are way more of a competition problem than any online service. Hereâ€™s some new language in the bill excluding telcos. It explicitly says that the definition of an â€œonline platformâ€�:\ndoes not include a service by wire or radio that provides the capability to transmit data to and receive data from all or substantially all internet endpoints, including any capabilities that are incidental to and enable the operation of the communications service.\nGot it? So, no preferencing. Unless youâ€™re the only broadband player in town. Then, go hog-wild, according to Senator Klobuchar.\nNice work there. That wonâ€™t make people cynical at all about the political process.\nOf course, once again, this is almost certainly appeasement to Republicans, who, for clear political reasons, want to continue to pretend that telcos are no big deal, and that itâ€™s only the big internet providers who are evil.\nIt makes no sense at all that Democrats like Amy Klobuchar are playing right into their hands, and giving them everything that they want. But, of course, Klobuchuar has decided for political reasons that she wants to be seen as the senator who took on big tech for her next presidential campaign. And, if that means handing Republicans all the tools they need to file a ton of vexatious lawsuits to try to force companies to enable more hate speech and propaganda, so be it.\nItâ€™s pure cynical opportunism.\nOh, and also, it looks like financial firms got a little carve out as well. The original bill said the term online platforms would apply to websites that â€œfacilitates the offering, advertising, sale, purchase, payment, or shipping of products or servicesâ€¦â€� The new version of the bill covers those that â€œenables the offering, advertising, sale, purchase, or shipping of products or servicesâ€¦â€�\nSo, the same list minus payments.\nThatâ€™s two giant industries â€” telcos and banks â€” that were able to secure their carveouts. But, no effort to fix any of the actual problems of the bill.\nWith the original bill, NERA Economic Consulting had written up an analysis of companies that would be considered covered platforms in the bill, noting that it directly would hit just six: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and likely TikTok. However, it also noted that there were 13 other companies that were below the size thresholds in the bill, but close enough that they would likely â€œtake measure to avoid significant risk incumbent upon exceeding the thresholds.â€� Notably, many of those included broadband companies and financial companies. By my count, the new carve outs in the bill likely cut that list of 13 by at least 7.\nItâ€™s possible that some of the others might be excluded as well, though Iâ€™m not as sure. Still, it seems pretty clear that these new carveouts were directly because of lobbying by these firms that didnâ€™t want to be included, despite the fact that all are arguably much more problematic, and have much less readily available competition than the companies targeted by the bill.\nItâ€™s enough to make one think that senators like Klobuchar donâ€™t really care about doing the right thing at all. They just want to be seen as doing something.\nfrom the good-deals-on-cool-stuff dept\nThe GameCreators Mega Maker Pack Bundle will help you develop your own dream video game, and publish it on multiple platforms with thousands of royalty-free, 2D and 3D assets.

Maybe Congress might want to start asking a few questions about this breach and pass along the same set of questions to other private contractors who may be playing fast and loose with personal data theyâ€™ve collected.\nfrom the scapegoats-are-not-good-policymaking dept\nThe recent mass murders in Buffalo and Uvalde are sickening, horrifying, and extraordinarily frustrating. And part of that is because, as The Onion keeps having to point out, we live in a world where the underlying message is: â€˜No Way To Prevent This,â€™ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\nAnd that is the most frustrating part of this. There are ways to deal with this. But theyâ€™re politically infeasible. Democrats focus on what appear to be pretty basic gun control concepts, around background checks, and putting at least some limits on the more extreme weapons out there (i.e., the ones favored in many of these mass murders). Republicans politicians (though, bizarrely, not the actual voters, outside of a few extremes) refuse to even consider any kind of gun laws. At all.\nRepublican talking points have focused on mental health. And, clearly, that is an issue. But it also raises the question: why arenâ€™t Republicans then in favor of better, more readily available, mental healthcare for everyone? Or, even more to the point, why are Republicans, who say theyâ€™re concerned about mental healthcare, unwilling to consider gun laws that might keep guns out of the hands of those who are at risk of committing a mass murder?\nAnd, Democrats, being feckless and incompetent as always, take all of their talking points and focus by letting Republicans frame the debate entirely, always on the defensive, and rarely, if ever, making even the slightest attempt to frame things in a positive manner. Itâ€™s always just pushing back on Republicanâ€™s and their dishonest framing.\nBoth parties deserve each other, but neither seems to want to explore actual solutions.\nAnd thus, theyâ€™re converging on the same nonsense: blame social media.\nWe saw it in New York, where itâ€™s now clear there were multiple levels of government failings that contributed to the situation in Buffalo, but where the Governor and the Attorney General have decided it was easier to blame social media than to tackle the real issues related to a racist teenager deciding to commit mass murder.\nAnd, now weâ€™re seeing people trying to do the same regarding the equally horrifying mass murder (of children!) in Texas. US Senate candidate from Georgia, Herschel Walker, (who is not exactly known for coherently talking about anything) went on TV to argue that the answer canâ€™t be taking away 2nd Amendment rights, but should be taking away 1st Amendment rights.\nIn that video he says:\nWhat we need to do is look into how we can stop those things. You talk about doing the disinformation. What about getting a department that can look at young men thatâ€™s looking at women thatâ€™s looking at social media. What about doing that? Looking into things like that? And we can stop things that way. Yet they want to just continue to talk about taking away your Constitutional rightsâ€¦\nNews flash, Herschel: a department that is looking into the speech of people also is taking away constitutional rights. Itâ€™s the first one. The one before the one youâ€™re talking about.\nBut, even if you want to dismiss that as Herschel Walker being Herschel Walker, there are more serious conversations that seem to want to keep pointing the finger at social media as well. The Washington Post, for example, has a story covering both mass murders with the title: As young gunmen turn toward new social networks, old safeguards fail. And again, it seems to want to suggest thereâ€™s some sort of blame here:\nBoth the Uvalde, Texas, shooter and the one in Buffalo, used a combination of disappearing video-app Snapchat, Instagram direct messages, chat-app Discord and social-app Yubo to meet people and share their violent plans with acquaintances. In the case of the Buffalo shooting, the gunman also used video streaming platform Twitch to publicize his deadly attack.\nThese apps are communications apps. People communicate with them. Itâ€™s weird to blame the tools for the actual communications, but that always seems to be the focus.\nAnd, to some extent, I understand the psychological reasons for this. The framing of the debate means actual solutions are off the table. I mean, anyone who even mentions guns is accused of â€œpoliticizingâ€� tragedy. So, itâ€™s easy as a kind of venting to focus anger and blame on the tech industry at a moment when the media narrative has been already beating up on that industry from every direction. So why not just blame mass murder on it as well?\nTo be clear, I actually think the meat of the Washington Post article is fairly balanced, and it includes comments from smart people highlighting that these services have been mostly incredibly powerful in useful ways for people. But, it just feels like the frustration about not being able to do anything about the bigger issues â€” guns and mental health â€” means everyone is converging on the current favorite punching bag: social media.","nextPages":["https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/27/daily-deal-the-gamecreators-mega-maker-pack-bundle/","https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/27/ice-facial-recognition-contractor-leaks-a-whole-bunch-of-personal-data/","https://www.techdirt.com/2022/05/27/social-media-is-the-easy-scapegoat-for-politicians-who-dont-want-to-deal-with-actual-problems/"],"summary":"from the what-are-we-doing-here?

Gov. John Fetterman, went so far as to outline specific gun policy goals in a statement this week &mdash; calling for &ldquo;universal background checks for all gun sales and a ban on military-grade assault weapons and high capacity magazines&rdquo; &mdash; even Democrats acknowledge Pennsylvania has one of the highest<a data-tracking=\"mpos=&mid=&lindex=&lcol=\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/gun-ownership-rates-by-state/2/\"> gun ownership rates</a> in the country.</p>\n<p>When he was first running for Congress in 2018, Rep. Conor Lamb &mdash; whom Fetterman defeated in the state&rsquo;s May 17 Democratic primary &mdash; included in his opening<a data-tracking=\"mpos=&mid=&lindex=&lcol=\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BnOHydNcrM&t=9s\"> television ad</a> a photo of himself shooting a rifle at a firing range.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Still loves to shoot,&rdquo; the narrator said of Lamb, after noting he had spent four years in the Marines.</p>\n<p>The Senate&rsquo;s most vulnerable Democratic incumbents this fall are refraining from specific calls to round up assault weapons or implement sweeping changes to federal firearm laws. Instead, they&rsquo;re using measured language like &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; gun reform and &ldquo;we must act&rdquo; when speaking about the need to prevent future gun violence. While Kelly has previously expressed support for universal background checks, red flag laws and closing loopholes that allow domestic abusers to buy guns, the senator has so far held off from calling for specific policy proposals this week.</p>\n<p>Justin Barasky, a strategist who most recently served as a senior adviser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said GOP candidates&rsquo; reluctance to discuss additional gun restrictions likely won&rsquo;t single-handedly motivate undecided voters. But it &ldquo;contributes to the growing problems Republicans have&rdquo; with those voters, which also includes the party&rsquo;s support for rolling back abortion rights.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These types of things that Republicans are so widely out of step on, hurt them, I think, in swing areas &mdash; and it has in the past,&rdquo; Barasky said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the reasons Republicans lost in 2020.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Several national strategists contacted for this story &mdash; on both sides of the aisle &mdash; said it&rsquo;s likely only a matter of time until the gun violence conversation blows over again. In their cynical view, swing-state Republicans are unlikely to face repercussions for keeping a low profile on the issue because inflation and economic concerns, meanwhile, remain a top priority for voters.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One week it&rsquo;s abortion, one week it&rsquo;s guns. One week it&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; said a Republican involved in Senate races. &ldquo;At the end of the day, there are a lot of other issues that are going to be front and center.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In recent years, however, support for some gun restrictions has appeared to work in some swing-state Republicans&rsquo; favor. In a tight reelection campaign in 2016, when polls showed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) trailing his Democratic opponent at times, the Republican earned an endorsement from Kelly and Giffords&rsquo; anti-gun violence PAC. Their support came after he spearheaded a bipartisan gun reform bill that ultimately failed in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Two years later, in the aftermath of a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a series of gun control measures. A month later, Scott officially announced his challenge to Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, a race he later won by one-tenth of a percentage point.</p>\n<p>Though Scott initially drew heat from some Republicans &mdash; and from the National Rifle Association &mdash; for supporting the Parkland bill, he worked that year to repair his reputation on the right as a Second Amendment champion. By Election Day, he had also largely inoculated himself from criticism that he failed to act on gun violence.</p>\n<p>In the current political environment, some strategists see limited gun reform measures like red flag laws &mdash; which give law enforcement the ability to seek a judge&rsquo;s approval to seize firearms from someone in mental distress or who has threatened to harm others &mdash; as more attainable than most other prospective restrictions.</p>\n<p>A vulnerable Democrat in a state like Arizona should seize on the issue relentlessly, Coughlin suggested, given the favorable polling surrounding a limited-scope policy to take guns from someone who has declared their intent to shoot others.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kelly could do it very effectively, because it&rsquo;s going to be very popular with unaffiliated voters,&rdquo; Coughlin said. &ldquo;And probably popular with nearly a majority of the Republican electorate, except primary voters &mdash; depending on what you say.&rdquo;</p>","id":"ART259200990392","text":"Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz was forced to distance himself from past comments made in favor of gun regulations. | Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\nBy Natalie Allison\n 05/27/2022 04:30 AM EDT\nTheyâ€™ve fired rifles.

Mark Kelly, whose wife, Gabrielle Giffords, sustained serious injuries when, as a congresswoman, she was shot in 2011.\nThe state was rated the most gun-friendly state in the nation last year by Guns and Ammo magazine.\nâ€œDemocrats have it exactly backwards â€” they want to outlaw our guns, as they free violent criminals and defund the police,â€� GOP Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters said in a statement. â€œWeâ€™re not going to ban guns â€” period.â€�\nHe continued by suggesting schools have armed and trained security guards and that society â€œactually fix the cultureâ€� so â€œfewer kids grow up in isolated, broken homes.â€�\nMark Brnovich, the Republican state attorney general running for Senate, said he hopes the country â€œwill reflect on our humanity instead of racing to politicize such a heartbreaking tragedy.â€� A spokesperson for Jim Lamon, another top contender, did not respond to a request for comment, and Lamon has not addressed the shooting on social media.\nThe Arizona GOP fieldâ€™s reluctance to talk about bipartisan gun reform efforts or other new restrictions comes as firearms have featured prominently in their campaigns. Lamon drew national attention in February after running a Super Bowl ad of him firing shots at stand-ins for Kelly, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Masters, meanwhile, posted a campaign video last fall of him holding a short-barreled rifle.\nâ€œIt wasnâ€™t designed for hunting. This is designed to kill people,â€� Masters said in the video. â€œBut if youâ€™re not a bad guy, I support your right to own one.â€�\nâ€œI donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to see Republican primary candidates talk about trying to fix it,â€� said Chuck Coughlin, an Arizona-based GOP strategist, referring to gun laws. â€œI just donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to happen. Unless theyâ€™re acting completely out of conscience, I couldnâ€™t see it being played to a political advantage.â€�\nWithin days of each other, Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidates Dave McCormick and Mehmet Oz released ads last month showing themselves firing guns â€” in both cases, shooting rounds using three different types of firearms.\nThe ads came as both candidates, political outsiders who moved back to Pennsylvania to run for the Senate seat, sought to prove their conservative bona fides to Republican voters in the face of intense attacks about their backgrounds.\nOz, in particular, was forced to distance himself from past comments made in favor of gun regulations, including banning semi-automatic weapons and implementing universal background checks and waiting periods.\nThe two candidates â€” who are engaged in an official recount after Oz took a narrow lead in last weekâ€™s primary election â€” each posted on social media that they were mourning those killed in the shooting, but stopped short of proposing any change in gun laws.\nThough the stateâ€™s Democratic Senate nominee, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, went so far as to outline specific gun policy goals in a statement this week â€” calling for â€œuniversal background checks for all gun sales and a ban on military-grade assault weapons and high capacity magazinesâ€� â€” even Democrats acknowledge Pennsylvania has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the country.\nWhen he was first running for Congress in 2018, Rep. Conor Lamb â€” whom Fetterman defeated in the stateâ€™s May 17 Democratic primary â€” included in his opening television ad a photo of himself shooting a rifle at a firing range.\nâ€œStill loves to shoot,â€� the narrator said of Lamb, after noting he had spent four years in the Marines.\nThe Senateâ€™s most vulnerable Democratic incumbents this fall are refraining from specific calls to round up assault weapons or implement sweeping changes to federal firearm laws. Instead, theyâ€™re using measured language like â€œcommon senseâ€� gun reform and â€œwe must actâ€� when speaking about the need to prevent future gun violence. While Kelly has previously expressed support for universal background checks, red flag laws and closing loopholes that allow domestic abusers to buy guns, the senator has so far held off from calling for specific policy proposals this week.\nJustin Barasky, a strategist who most recently served as a senior adviser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said GOP candidatesâ€™ reluctance to discuss additional gun restrictions likely wonâ€™t single-handedly motivate undecided voters. But it â€œcontributes to the growing problems Republicans haveâ€� with those voters, which also includes the partyâ€™s support for rolling back abortion rights.\nâ€œThese types of things that Republicans are so widely out of step on, hurt them, I think, in swing areas â€” and it has in the past,â€� Barasky said. â€œItâ€™s one of the reasons Republicans lost in 2020.â€�\nSeveral national strategists contacted for this story â€” on both sides of the aisle â€” said itâ€™s likely only a matter of time until the gun violence conversation blows over again. In their cynical view, swing-state Republicans are unlikely to face repercussions for keeping a low profile on the issue because inflation and economic concerns, meanwhile, remain a top priority for voters.\nâ€œOne week itâ€™s abortion, one week itâ€™s guns. One week itâ€™s something else,â€� said a Republican involved in Senate races. â€œAt the end of the day, there are a lot of other issues that are going to be front and center.â€�\nIn recent years, however, support for some gun restrictions has appeared to work in some swing-state Republicansâ€™ favor. In a tight reelection campaign in 2016, when polls showed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) trailing his Democratic opponent at times, the Republican earned an endorsement from Kelly and Giffordsâ€™ anti-gun violence PAC. Their support came after he spearheaded a bipartisan gun reform bill that ultimately failed in the Senate.\nTwo years later, in the aftermath of a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a series of gun control measures. A month later, Scott officially announced his challenge to Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, a race he later won by one-tenth of a percentage point.\nThough Scott initially drew heat from some Republicans â€” and from the National Rifle Association â€” for supporting the Parkland bill, he worked that year to repair his reputation on the right as a Second Amendment champion. By Election Day, he had also largely inoculated himself from criticism that he failed to act on gun violence.\nIn the current political environment, some strategists see limited gun reform measures like red flag laws â€” which give law enforcement the ability to seek a judgeâ€™s approval to seize firearms from someone in mental distress or who has threatened to harm others â€” as more attainable than most other prospective restrictions.\nA vulnerable Democrat in a state like Arizona should seize on the issue relentlessly, Coughlin suggested, given the favorable polling surrounding a limited-scope policy to take guns from someone who has declared their intent to shoot others.\nâ€œKelly could do it very effectively, because itâ€™s going to be very popular with unaffiliated voters,â€� Coughlin said. â€œAnd probably popular with nearly a majority of the Republican electorate, except primary voters â€” depending on what you say.â€�","categories":[{"score":0.997,"name":"News and Politics","id":"iabv2-379"},{"score":0.994,"name":"Politics","id":"iabv2-386"},{"score":0.987,"name":"Elections","id":"iabv2-387"}],"summary":"Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz was forced to distance himself from past com...","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/12adfa6/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x821%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb1%2F7e%2F39d2d0d14de2ba8ea5491a84e7a2%2Fhttps-delivery.gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1240497849","types":["Article","GlobalIndexDiffbotEntity"],"images":[{"summary":"","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/12adfa6/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x821%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb1%2F7e%2F39d2d0d14de2ba8ea5491a84e7a2%2Fhttps-delivery.gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1240497849","naturalHeight":821,"name":"","url":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/12adfa6/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x821%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb1%2F7e%2F39d2d0d14de2ba8ea5491a84e7a2%2Fhttps-delivery.gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1240497849","naturalWidth":1200}],"diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/ART259200990392","tags":[{"score":0.9894472,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation"],"count":9,"label":"United States Senate","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EDXOHrBYDNaaAmnqOgZT_qg"},{"score":0.98400867,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":3,"label":"Pennsylvania","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/Ex3wPwcFXMVOKdTNpozja6w"},{"score":0.9752879,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PoliticalParty"],"count":7,"label":"Republican Party","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EQux7TYFDMgO6n_OByeSXzg"},{"score":0.9734695,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":1,"label":"Herschel Walker","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EH68p_DdAPqOhAwCi3cVm7Q"},{"score":0.97304213,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":4,"label":"Arizona","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EkKWs_QfaM9i8ZUIhyb7xJQ"},{"score":0.9670035,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":3,"label":"Nevada","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E3V75tYm4ObOt1UP35jWxEQ"},{"score":0.96131045,"sentiment":-0.64,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":1,"label":"Gabrielle Giffords","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EC_lGjyhIP8iSzuv1YTMPLw"},{"score":0.93849796,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":2,"label":"Georgia","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E_L-1Z6pbMUuEvXV5RpTMaQ"},{"score":0.9073687,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":6,"label":"Adam Laxalt","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EzzDFlwZtPQyFGc4KNdwXxw"},{"score":0.90337664,"sentiment":-0.717,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":4,"label":"Mark Kelly","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/ESf6NqTWONZukb5YKUslImg"}],"lastCrawlTime":1653654013,"publisherCountry":"United States","name":"The gun debate roadblock you might not expect: Swing states","pageUrl":"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/27/swing-state-politics-stymie-gun-debate-00035637","resolvedPageUrl":""}},

Brian Kemp speaks during his primary-night election party at the Chick-fil-A College Football Hall of Fame on May 24, 2022, in Atlanta. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>This content comes from the latest installment of our weekly Breaking the Vote newsletter out of VICE News&rsquo; D.C. bureau, tracking the ongoing efforts to undermine the democratic process in America.</em> <em>Sign up <a href=\"https://link1.vice.com/join/6qz/signup-breakingthevote\">here</a> to get it in your inbox every Friday.</em></p>\n<p>The primary results out of Georgia this week seemed like a rebuke of former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&rsquo;s stolen-election poison in the GOP, and a big boost for democracy. Both of Trump&rsquo;s candidates, hand-picked to exact revenge on GOP incumbents who didn&rsquo;t overturn the 2020 election for him, got beaten, and badly. Trump&rsquo;s perceived enemies not only survived but thrived in the GOP field he dominates.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to read Gov. <strong>Brian Kemp </strong>and Secretary of State <strong>Brad Raffensperger</strong>&rsquo;s wins as the first real sign that Trump&rsquo;s grip on the GOP is dying, and that his dream of stealing 2024 is dying with it. But that would be a mistake, longtime Republican consultant<strong> Sarah Longwell </strong>told me.</p>\n<p>Longwell spends the bulk of her time running Republican and independent voter focus groups, looking for the messages that can draw those voters away from Trumpism and toward the Democrats challenging it. She says the high that you, a democracy-loving <em>Breaking the Vote</em> reader, are feeling from Georgia probably won&rsquo;t last.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unmitigated win for democracy,&rdquo; Longwell told me. But she added, &ldquo;One hundred percent what people shouldn&rsquo;t do is overread Georgia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kemp bludgeoned former Sen. <strong>David Perdue </strong>by more than 50 points. Perdue made a habit of opening his debate appearances with the refrain that 2020 was stolen.</p>\n<p>Voters didn&rsquo;t respond, but Longwell says that&rsquo;s not because Republicans in the GOP don&rsquo;t like Trump, or believe<strong> Joe Biden</strong> won fair and square. Instead, Kemp gave conservatives a lot of what they loved from a conservative incumbent. He acted early against COVID restrictions that were unpopular with conservatives and proved his bona fides by passing a lot of voter suppression in the name of &ldquo;election integrity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They really remember that. He took their concerns seriously. Whether or not that concern is misguided, from our perspective, is another issue. Their concerns were heard,&rdquo; says Longwell, who also publishes the never-Trump Republican site <em>The Bulwark</em>.</p>\n<p>It feels&hellip; risky&hellip; to invest the protection of democracy in a governor who kept power by making voting harder in Georgia. &ldquo;I think we can count on Brian Kemp not to overturn an election. It&rsquo;s fair to say that&rsquo;s a low bar,&rdquo; Longwell says.</p>\n<p>Raffensperger also worked hard to play up his conservative cred, and he benefited from Kemp&rsquo;s coattails. &ldquo;You would ask Georgia Republicans, &lsquo;What do you think of (Rep.) <strong>Jody Hice</strong>?&rsquo; and they would say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of her,&rsquo;&rdquo; Longwell says of Trump&rsquo;s endorsed secretary of state candidate, who is a man.</p>\n<p>But Georgia is also the only swing state with two passably pro-democracy GOP incumbents up for governor and secretary of state. It&rsquo;s an outlier, not a bellwether: Take a spin around Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin and you&rsquo;ll see the GOP pushing leading candidates who are ready to attack elections for Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no evidence there you&rsquo;ve got candidates that are anything but Stop the Steal acolytes,&rdquo; Longwell says. &ldquo;The voters are plenty Trumpy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Wisconsin, the leading GOP governor candidate, <strong>Rebecca Kleefisch</strong>, recently called 2020 &ldquo;rigged.&rdquo; <strong>Kari Lake</strong>, a huge supporter of conspiracy theories and the Cyber Ninjas&rsquo; &ldquo;audit&rdquo; is likely to win in Arizona and take QAnon-steeped state Rep. <strong>Mark Finchem</strong> with her for secretary of state. And Pennsylvania Republicans just nominated state Sen. <strong><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdn57/pennsylvania-doug-mastriano-primary\">Doug Mastriano</a></strong>, a Christian nationalist who attended the Jan. 6 riot, for governor. Longwell thinks he&rsquo;s more vulnerable than the others.</p>\n<p>Republicans are using stolen-election lies &ldquo;as a revenge tour. It&rsquo;s rocket fuel and a turnout mechanism,&rdquo; Longwell says. &ldquo;In general elections you&rsquo;ll see more focus on inflation and crime and stuff for normie Republicans.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That means places like Arizona, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania won&rsquo;t necessarily follow Georgia&rsquo;s lead. Their Trumpist candidates can shoot to nominations without challenging GOP incumbents, then switch to a &ldquo;parallel universe&rdquo; where undermining elections need not turn off less-feral Republicans.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As we go into 2024, the rest of the GOP fields are decidedly anti-democracy,&rdquo; Longwell says.</p>\n<p><strong>Sign up your friends for </strong><em><strong><a href=\"http://vice.com/breakingthevote\">Breaking the Vote!</a></strong></em></p>\n<figure><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664657002-unnamed-2-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 700px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664657002-unnamed-2-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664657002-unnamed-2-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><img alt=\"unnamed (2) (1).jpg\" src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664657002-unnamed-2-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></img></picture></figure>\n<p>This Week in Subpoenas, the January 6 committee is about to turn those subpoenas into swearings-in. The panel has begun telegraphing the game plan for its long-awaited public hearings, where they&rsquo;ll try to make the case that Jan. 6 was the culmination of a broader criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.</p>\n<p>Things are set to kick off at 8 p.m. on Thursday, June 9, and end two weeks later in prime time on June 23. There will be four hearings in-between, on June 13, 15, 16, and 21. The <em>Guardian&rsquo;</em>s Hugo Lowell has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/capitol-attack-panel-public-hearings-trump\">scoop</a> that committee prosecutors will do the questioning, since they know how to query witnesses and aren&rsquo;t genetically programmed to grandstand like lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Committee members know these hearings are their last, best chance to make a clear, easy-to-follow case to the TV- and internet-viewing public that Trump and his lieutenants committed crimes as they plotted to subvert the voters&rsquo; will and preserve Trump&rsquo;s power. That will be important if there&rsquo;s to be any political price for Republicans who participated in the insurrection&mdash;or for those who tolerate, enable, or cover up for them.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s <strong>Merrick Garland</strong>, the attorney general and audience-of-one for these hearings, at least legally. The ultimate decision whether to prosecute not just rioters but coup plotters, including Trump, will be his. The committee will have to show that all the episodes revealed over the past year&mdash;the months of tweets <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/us/politics/trump-tweet-jan-6.html\">flooding</a> stolen-election lies into the mainstream, the <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/fake-electors-trump-overthrow-election-2020/\">schemes</a> to send fake electors from swing states to Washington (which federal prosecutors are already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/us/politics/pro-trump-lawyers-elector-scheme.html\">sniffing at</a>), the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-logs-show-over-7-hr-gap-trump-calls-jan-6-report-2022-03-29/\">gaps</a> in White House phone records while violence raged at the Capitol, the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/eastman-pence-email-riot-trump/2021/10/29/59373016-38c1-11ec-91dc-551d44733e2d_story.html\">plot</a> to pressure VP <strong>Mike Pence</strong> into helping steal the election, the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/12/politics/scott-perry-justice-department-big-lie/index.html\">effort</a> to turn the DOJ into a justice-subverting coup factory, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/john-eastman-suggested-that-pa-lawmakers-delete-2020-vote-totals-2022-5\">maneuvering</a> to cajole state legislators into deleting votes, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-joe-biden-arts-and-entertainment-elections-georgia-2b27f4c92919556bf6548117648693b7\">wheedling</a> of Georgia officials to &ldquo;find&rdquo; votes, and, yes, the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/politics/mark-meadows-texts-2319/index.html\">texts</a>&mdash;all combine into a picture of a criminal conspiracy the committee believes demands prosecution in the name of protecting the Constitution and the republic.</p>\n<p>Happy viewing!</p>\n<p>Add <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/us/politics/trump-pence-jan-6.html\">these episodes</a> to the list of revelations likely to come out in public hearings: The committee has been told by multiple sources that Trump watched Jan. 6 rioters chanting &ldquo;Hang Mike Pence!&rdquo; on TV and remarked that maybe Pence &ldquo;should be hung.&rdquo; (BTW, yes, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;hanged.&rdquo; Sometimes it&rsquo;s just absolutely vital to be a grammar scold.)</p>\n<p>At first glance, that&rsquo;s just another example of the level of Trump&rsquo;s vitriol for those he considers disloyal; at second glance, it&rsquo;s a shocking instance of a U.S. president contemplating the summary execution of his veep. But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/1529514846659674115\">here&rsquo;s the case</a> for why it could mean a lot more legally.</p>\n<p>Tucked at the bottom of that piece was the bombshell that then-chief of staff <strong>Mark Meadows</strong> used the fireplace in his White House office to burn documents. Within a day, we learned that the revelation came from former Meadows staffer <strong>Cassidy Hutchinson</strong>, who told the committee she observed Meadows torching docs after meeting with Pennsylvania Rep. <strong>Scott Perry</strong>. Yep, that&rsquo;s the same Scott Perry who tried to help turn the DOJ into Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/us/politics/scott-perry-trump-justice-department-election.html\">personal coup operation</a> and now has Meadows&rsquo; old job heading the right-wing Freedom Caucus.</p>\n<p>Last week VICE News&rsquo; <strong>Cameron Joseph</strong> wrote about how the racist and antisemitic &ldquo;great replacement&rdquo; theory has <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nxmk/gop-great-replacement-theory\">migrated</a> from the white supremacist fringe to the center of GOP politics.

While the murders continue, one of the elected GOP&rsquo;s most visible purveyors of a laundered version of this slime is New York <strong>Rep. Elise Stefanik</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/23/stefanik-company-political-donations/\">raised money</a> off it earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Turns out that corporate donations are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/23/stefanik-company-political-donations/\">still gushing</a> toward Stefanik, even from the very companies that pledged to speak out, and spend, against discrimination after the murder of <strong>George Floyd</strong>. Why would corporations not speak out like they did after Jan. 6, or Floyd&rsquo;s murder? One reason might be that companies are on notice that Republicans will use state power to <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/23/texas-companies-pay-abortions/\">punish</a> corporate dissent against their policies. As I repeat nearly every week, <strong>GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2021/09/01/kevin-mccarthy-threatens-companies-about-turning-over-phone--computer-records-to-house-1-6-committee---a-republican-majority-will-not-forget-\">openly threatened</a> telecom companies who cooperate with Jan. 6 investigators with retaliation.

(Recall that <a href=\"https://www.annenbergclassroom.org/14th-amendment/\">Section 3</a> bars any federal office holder who&rsquo;s taken an oath to defend the Constitution from holding office again if they do an insurrection or rebellion.) Cawthorn lost his primary last week, so for him, for now, it&rsquo;s moot. But since a federal appeals court has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-f719-d5d6-a1d4-ffd924b10000\">ruled</a> that the 1872 Amnesty Act doesn&rsquo;t bar Constitutional challenges to members of Congress under 14A, other lawmakers who may have participated in Jan. 6 are now likely fair game for challenges too. Think Reps.<strong> Paul Gosar</strong> and <strong>Andy Biggs</strong> from Arizona, who are on activists&rsquo; list for challenges. Georgia&rsquo;s <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> already <a href=\"https://thehill.com/news/state-watch/3479867-judge-marjorie-taylor-greene-is-qualified-for-reelection/\">beat</a> her 14A rap.</p>\n<p>Virginia Gov. <strong>Glenn Youngkin</strong>, who won election last year with the help of election-undermining Trumpists, actually did a small solid for voting this week.

Still, Youngkin&rsquo;s gesture was tiny compared to previous Democratic and GOP governors, who restored voting rights to hundreds of thousands of Virginians.</p>\n<figure><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664574408-unnamed-4.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 700px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664574408-unnamed-4.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664574408-unnamed-4.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><img alt=\"unnamed (4).jpg\" src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664574408-unnamed-4.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></img></picture></figure>\n<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard President Trump ever say that.&rdquo;</em> - Georgia GOP Senate nominee <strong>Herschel Walker</strong>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AccountableGOP/status/1529104369928785920\">asked</a> about Donald Trump&rsquo;s assertions that the 2020 election was stolen</p>\n<figure><picture><source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664609336-unnamed-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 700px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664609336-unnamed-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" srcset=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664609336-unnamed-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></source><img alt=\"unnamed (1).jpg\" src=\"https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1653664609336-unnamed-1.jpeg?resize=20:*\"></img></picture></figure>\n<p><strong>TrainWEC </strong>&mdash; Wisconsin&rsquo;s bid to be the swing-state king of stolen-election destruction continues.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\nThe primary results out of Georgia this week seemed like a rebuke of former President Donald Trumpâ€™s stolen-election poison in the GOP, and a big boost for democracy. Both of Trumpâ€™s candidates, hand-picked to exact revenge on GOP incumbents who didnâ€™t overturn the 2020 election for him, got beaten, and badly. Trumpâ€™s perceived enemies not only survived but thrived in the GOP field he dominates.\nItâ€™s tempting to read Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffenspergerâ€™s wins as the first real sign that Trumpâ€™s grip on the GOP is dying, and that his dream of stealing 2024 is dying with it. But that would be a mistake, longtime Republican consultant Sarah Longwell told me.\nLongwell spends the bulk of her time running Republican and independent voter focus groups, looking for the messages that can draw those voters away from Trumpism and toward the Democrats challenging it. She says the high that you, a democracy-loving Breaking the Vote reader, are feeling from Georgia probably wonâ€™t last.\nâ€œItâ€™s an unmitigated win for democracy,â€� Longwell told me. But she added, â€œOne hundred percent what people shouldnâ€™t do is overread Georgia.â€�\nKemp bludgeoned former Sen. David Perdue by more than 50 points. Perdue made a habit of opening his debate appearances with the refrain that 2020 was stolen.\nVoters didnâ€™t respond, but Longwell says thatâ€™s not because Republicans in the GOP donâ€™t like Trump, or believe Joe Biden won fair and square. Instead, Kemp gave conservatives a lot of what they loved from a conservative incumbent. He acted early against COVID restrictions that were unpopular with conservatives and proved his bona fides by passing a lot of voter suppression in the name of â€œelection integrity.â€�\nâ€œThey really remember that. He took their concerns seriously. Whether or not that concern is misguided, from our perspective, is another issue. Their concerns were heard,â€� says Longwell, who also publishes the never-Trump Republican site The Bulwark.\nIt feelsâ€¦ riskyâ€¦ to invest the protection of democracy in a governor who kept power by making voting harder in Georgia. â€œI think we can count on Brian Kemp not to overturn an election. Itâ€™s fair to say thatâ€™s a low bar,â€� Longwell says.\nRaffensperger also worked hard to play up his conservative cred, and he benefited from Kempâ€™s coattails. â€œYou would ask Georgia Republicans, â€˜What do you think of (Rep.) Jody Hice?â€™ and they would say, â€˜Iâ€™ve never heard of her,â€™â€� Longwell says of Trumpâ€™s endorsed secretary of state candidate, who is a man.\nBut Georgia is also the only swing state with two passably pro-democracy GOP incumbents up for governor and secretary of state. Itâ€™s an outlier, not a bellwether: Take a spin around Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin and youâ€™ll see the GOP pushing leading candidates who are ready to attack elections for Trump.\nâ€œThereâ€™s no evidence there youâ€™ve got candidates that are anything but Stop the Steal acolytes,â€� Longwell says. â€œThe voters are plenty Trumpy.â€�\nIn Wisconsin, the leading GOP governor candidate, Rebecca Kleefisch, recently called 2020 â€œrigged.â€� Kari Lake, a huge supporter of conspiracy theories and the Cyber Ninjasâ€™ â€œauditâ€� is likely to win in Arizona and take QAnon-steeped state Rep. Mark Finchem with her for secretary of state. And Pennsylvania Republicans just nominated state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Christian nationalist who attended the Jan. 6 riot, for governor. Longwell thinks heâ€™s more vulnerable than the others.\nRepublicans are using stolen-election lies â€œas a revenge tour. Itâ€™s rocket fuel and a turnout mechanism,â€� Longwell says. â€œIn general elections youâ€™ll see more focus on inflation and crime and stuff for normie Republicans.â€�\nThat means places like Arizona, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania wonâ€™t necessarily follow Georgiaâ€™s lead. Their Trumpist candidates can shoot to nominations without challenging GOP incumbents, then switch to a â€œparallel universeâ€� where undermining elections need not turn off less-feral Republicans.\nâ€œAs we go into 2024, the rest of the GOP fields are decidedly anti-democracy,â€� Longwell says.\nSign up your friends for Breaking the Vote!\nThis Week in Subpoenas, the January 6 committee is about to turn those subpoenas into swearings-in. The panel has begun telegraphing the game plan for its long-awaited public hearings, where theyâ€™ll try to make the case that Jan. 6 was the culmination of a broader criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.\nThings are set to kick off at 8 p.m. on Thursday, June 9, and end two weeks later in prime time on June 23. There will be four hearings in-between, on June 13, 15, 16, and 21. The Guardianâ€™s Hugo Lowell has the scoop that committee prosecutors will do the questioning, since they know how to query witnesses and arenâ€™t genetically programmed to grandstand like lawmakers.\nCommittee members know these hearings are their last, best chance to make a clear, easy-to-follow case to the TV- and internet-viewing public that Trump and his lieutenants committed crimes as they plotted to subvert the votersâ€™ will and preserve Trumpâ€™s power. That will be important if thereâ€™s to be any political price for Republicans who participated in the insurrectionâ€”or for those who tolerate, enable, or cover up for them.\nThen thereâ€™s Merrick Garland, the attorney general and audience-of-one for these hearings, at least legally. The ultimate decision whether to prosecute not just rioters but coup plotters, including Trump, will be his. The committee will have to show that all the episodes revealed over the past yearâ€”the months of tweets flooding stolen-election lies into the mainstream, the schemes to send fake electors from swing states to Washington (which federal prosecutors are already sniffing at), the gaps in White House phone records while violence raged at the Capitol, the plot to pressure VP Mike Pence into helping steal the election, the effort to turn the DOJ into a justice-subverting coup factory, the maneuvering to cajole state legislators into deleting votes, the wheedling of Georgia officials to â€œfindâ€� votes, and, yes, the textsâ€”all combine into a picture of a criminal conspiracy the committee believes demands prosecution in the name of protecting the Constitution and the republic.\nHappy viewing!\nAdd these episodes to the list of revelations likely to come out in public hearings: The committee has been told by multiple sources that Trump watched Jan. 6 rioters chanting â€œHang Mike Pence!â€� on TV and remarked that maybe Pence â€œshould be hung.â€� (BTW, yes, itâ€™s â€œhanged.â€� Sometimes itâ€™s just absolutely vital to be a grammar scold.)\nAt first glance, thatâ€™s just another example of the level of Trumpâ€™s vitriol for those he considers disloyal; at second glance, itâ€™s a shocking instance of a U.S. president contemplating the summary execution of his veep. But hereâ€™s the case for why it could mean a lot more legally.\nTucked at the bottom of that piece was the bombshell that then-chief of staff Mark Meadows used the fireplace in his White House office to burn documents. Within a day, we learned that the revelation came from former Meadows staffer Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the committee she observed Meadows torching docs after meeting with Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry. Yep, thatâ€™s the same Scott Perry who tried to help turn the DOJ into Trumpâ€™s personal coup operation and now has Meadowsâ€™ old job heading the right-wing Freedom Caucus.\nLast week VICE Newsâ€™ Cameron Joseph wrote about how the racist and antisemitic â€œgreat replacementâ€� theory has migrated from the white supremacist fringe to the center of GOP politics. Cast your mind back a few mass murders ago to Buffalo, or El Paso, or Pittsburgh, for why thatâ€™s really, lethally bad. While the murders continue, one of the elected GOPâ€™s most visible purveyors of a laundered version of this slime is New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who raised money off it earlier this year.\nTurns out that corporate donations are still gushing toward Stefanik, even from the very companies that pledged to speak out, and spend, against discrimination after the murder of George Floyd. Why would corporations not speak out like they did after Jan. 6, or Floydâ€™s murder? One reason might be that companies are on notice that Republicans will use state power to punish corporate dissent against their policies. As I repeat nearly every week, GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy has openly threatened telecom companies who cooperate with Jan. 6 investigators with retaliation. Ask Disney if Republicans are willing to follow through.\nAnother installment in our ongoing coverage of voter fraud perpetrated by the folks who are Totally Serious about voter fraud. The chair of the Seminole County (Florida) GOP, a political consultant (with a record), and a former state Senate candidate were all arrested and charged with multiple felonies behind a â€œghost candidateâ€� scheme designed to draw support away from a local Democrat in 2020.\nAnd this weekâ€™s a twofer! In Michigan, the state elections bureau has concluded that half of the GOP primary field for governor should be disqualified from the Aug. 2 election after the discovery of a massive signature fraud scheme. The bureau said five GOP candidates should be barred from running, including potentially leading candidates who echoed Trumpist â€œconcernsâ€� about election integrity. Together they submitted thousands of bogus signatures that, when found out, put them under the number of valid signers needed to qualify for the ballot, the bureau said.\nDo check out the bureauâ€™s report for hilariously bad examples of totally-not-fake Michiganders lending their support.\nGOP Rep. and aboveboard crypto investor Madison Cawthorn lost his appeal to block a challenge to his fitness for office under the 14th Amendment. (Recall that Section 3 bars any federal office holder whoâ€™s taken an oath to defend the Constitution from holding office again if they do an insurrection or rebellion.) Cawthorn lost his primary last week, so for him, for now, itâ€™s moot.

Walker, who won the Republican primary for the fiercely fought Senate seat earlier this week, has dissociative identity disorder and favors more resources devoted to studying the shooter's mentality than stricter gun control.</p>\n<p>Walker has sparked controversy by claiming that he holds himself accountable for his previous actions with his ex-wife, who has accused him of abuse. He did not acknowledge aggressive behavior, merely noting that he is responsible for whatever he has done.</p>\n<p>If Walker beats current Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) in the midterm elections in November, he will be the most prominent member of Congress to publicly discuss his battles with mental illness. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) has also stated that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in Iraq, the Marine Corps, according to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/herschel-walker-fumbles-response-to-gun-control-questions\">Washington Examiner</a>.</p>\n<p>Following the mass shooting at a Uvalde, Texas elementary school, Congress is considering a proposal to incentivize states to enact red flag legislation similar to the one Florida approved in 2018 to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous or mentally ill people.</p>\n<p>Florida's statute, adopted in the aftermath of the Parkland high school massacre, has been utilized thousands of times in the last four years to take weapons from citizens deemed a threat. Florida is one of 19 states that have enacted new, risk-based gun removal regulations to reduce gun-related deaths and address the unending spate of mass killings at schools and other public gatherings.</p>\n<p>If a judge believes that there is a risk to public safety, the statutes empower courts to temporarily restrict a person's right to acquire or possess weapons. However, gun rights advocates contend that red-flag regulations do not provide enough due process, are applied incorrectly or fallaciously, and can be hazardous, as per <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/may/26/texas-school-shooting-revives-calls-red-flag-laws-/\">Washington Times</a>.</p>\n<h2>Texas School Shooting Investigation Continues</h2>\n<p>Texas officials provided an update on what occurred Tuesday when a shooter opened fire at Robb Elementary School, killing 19 little children and two adults. According to Victor Escalon, the Department of Public Safety's South Texas Regional Director, the inquiry into what transpired is ongoing. He described the current timeline of what happened and when it transpired.</p>\n<p>At 11:28 am, Escalon stated. Police got the initial report of a truck collision around 10 am local time. The shooter fled after police claimed he shot his grandmother, who is currently in stable condition.</p>\n<p>The gunman then hopped out of the passenger side of the truck, carrying a weapon and a bag containing ammo. The shooter noticed two individuals at a neighboring funeral home and fired rounds at them, according to Escalon, before hopping a fence at the school, crossing a parking lot, and entering the elementary school through an unlocked entrance around 11:40 am.</p>\n<p>Escalon stated that a video was retrieved from both inside and outside the school that showed many bullets being fired inside. Officials are unable to provide an accurate figure. Officers were requesting assistance and attempting to send equipment and tactical teams to the location while the gunman was in the classroom.</p>\n<p>Officials were negotiating with the shooter while waiting for teams to arrive and planning how to enter the facility, according to Escalon. An hour later, a tactical team from the United States arrived. Customs and Border Patrol officers came. They shot and killed the shooter. There was also a Uvalde police officer and a sheriff's deputy there.</p>\n<p>Officers moved into rescue mode once the gunman was taken down to evacuate children and teachers out of the building. According to Escalon, the policemen who were present at the incident are being interrogated, and the inquiry is ongoing. He will offer more updates as new information becomes available.</p>\n<p>Following the update, Ross McGlothlin, a previous principal of Robb Elementary School, stated that the door would have normally been locked.

Walker, who won the Republican primary for the fiercely fought Senate seat earlier this week, has dissociative identity disorder and favors more resources devoted to studying the shooter's mentality than stricter gun control.\nWalker has sparked controversy by claiming that he holds himself accountable for his previous actions with his ex-wife, who has accused him of abuse. He did not acknowledge aggressive behavior, merely noting that he is responsible for whatever he has done.\nIf Walker beats current Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) in the midterm elections in November, he will be the most prominent member of Congress to publicly discuss his battles with mental illness. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) has also stated that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in Iraq, the Marine Corps, according to the Washington Examiner.\nFollowing the mass shooting at a Uvalde, Texas elementary school, Congress is considering a proposal to incentivize states to enact red flag legislation similar to the one Florida approved in 2018 to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous or mentally ill people.\nFlorida's statute, adopted in the aftermath of the Parkland high school massacre, has been utilized thousands of times in the last four years to take weapons from citizens deemed a threat. Florida is one of 19 states that have enacted new, risk-based gun removal regulations to reduce gun-related deaths and address the unending spate of mass killings at schools and other public gatherings.\nIf a judge believes that there is a risk to public safety, the statutes empower courts to temporarily restrict a person's right to acquire or possess weapons. However, gun rights advocates contend that red-flag regulations do not provide enough due process, are applied incorrectly or fallaciously, and can be hazardous, as per Washington Times.\nTexas School Shooting Investigation Continues\nTexas officials provided an update on what occurred Tuesday when a shooter opened fire at Robb Elementary School, killing 19 little children and two adults. According to Victor Escalon, the Department of Public Safety's South Texas Regional Director, the inquiry into what transpired is ongoing. He described the current timeline of what happened and when it transpired.\nAt 11:28 am, Escalon stated. Police got the initial report of a truck collision around 10 am local time. The shooter fled after police claimed he shot his grandmother, who is currently in stable condition.\nThe gunman then hopped out of the passenger side of the truck, carrying a weapon and a bag containing ammo. The shooter noticed two individuals at a neighboring funeral home and fired rounds at them, according to Escalon, before hopping a fence at the school, crossing a parking lot, and entering the elementary school through an unlocked entrance around 11:40 am.\nEscalon stated that a video was retrieved from both inside and outside the school that showed many bullets being fired inside. Officials are unable to provide an accurate figure. Officers were requesting assistance and attempting to send equipment and tactical teams to the location while the gunman was in the classroom.\nOfficials were negotiating with the shooter while waiting for teams to arrive and planning how to enter the facility, according to Escalon. An hour later, a tactical team from the United States arrived. Customs and Border Patrol officers came. They shot and killed the shooter. There was also a Uvalde police officer and a sheriff's deputy there.\nOfficers moved into rescue mode once the gunman was taken down to evacuate children and teachers out of the building. According to Escalon, the policemen who were present at the incident are being interrogated, and the inquiry is ongoing. He will offer more updates as new information becomes available.\nFollowing the update, Ross McGlothlin, a previous principal of Robb Elementary School, stated that the door would have normally been locked. When he worked for the district, he claimed there were school resource police, but they weren't assigned. He said that there was a mechanism in place that would notify instructors in the event of an emergency and tell them to go into lockdown, WSB-TV reported.\nRelated Article: Texas Elementary School Shooting: Father Reveals Heartbreaking Moment He Learned His Daughter Died in Horrific Attack\n@YouTube","summary":"Herschel Walker, a former football star, proposed an inexplicable answer to gun violence on Thursday...","image":"https://1075914428.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/270915/650/0/0/0/herschel-walker-reveals-shocking-solution-after-texas-school-shooting-focus-on-mental-health.jpg","types":["Article","GlobalIndexDiffbotEntity"],"images":[{"summary":"","image":"https://1075914428.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/270915/650/0/0/0/herschel-walker-reveals-shocking-solution-after-texas-school-shooting-focus-on-mental-health.jpg","naturalHeight":434,"name":"In wake of the Texas school shooting, Georgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker provides an odd response regarding his proposed solution to America's gun violence problem.","title":"In wake of the Texas school shooting, Georgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker provides an odd response regarding his proposed solution to America's gun violence problem.","url":"https://1075914428.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/270915/650/0/0/0/herschel-walker-reveals-shocking-solution-after-texas-school-shooting-focus-on-mental-health.jpg","naturalWidth":650}],"author":"Madz Dizon","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/ART97265424437","tags":[{"score":0.9994081,"sentiment":-0.9,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":21,"label":"Herschel Walker","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EH68p_DdAPqOhAwCi3cVm7Q"},{"score":0.9735377,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/City"],"count":1,"label":"Escalon","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/Ev3EKcmYnM3iCk_a58wkUTQ"},{"score":0.96815956,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":4,"label":"Texas","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EkoIuXpjvM6eoD4DCh1PbPA"},{"score":0.924831,"sentiment":-0.69,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":3,"label":"Florida","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E5csTBRvPP-eYFCUFXqXNLQ"},{"score":0.92243457,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Settlement","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/City"],"count":2,"label":"Uvalde","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EVQIlaBcBOsqEx3XsBqDajg"},{"score":0.88543475,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"],"count":1,"label":"Ruben Gallego","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/Emgizuno9O4m0j0YxmYNV6g"},{"score":0.8784646,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation"],"count":2,"label":"primary school","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EstUW1D0QNg6YSyx6TQeVwA"},{"score":0.835322,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Country"],"count":2,"label":"United States of America","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E01d4EK33MmCosgI2KXa4-A"},{"score":0.8076456,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Organisation"],"count":4,"label":"United States Senate","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/EDXOHrBYDNaaAmnqOgZT_qg"},{"score":0.80646086,"sentiment":0.0,"types":["http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Place","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/PopulatedPlace","http://dbpedia.org/ontology/State"],"count":3,"label":"Georgia","uri":"https://diffbot.com/entity/E_L-1Z6pbMUuEvXV5RpTMaQ"}],"lastCrawlTime":1653656458,"publisherCountry":"United States","name":"Herschel Walker Reveals Shocking Solution After Texas School Shooting: Focus on Mental Health","pageUrl":"https://www.hngn.com/articles/242390/20220526/herschel-walker-reveals-shocking-solution-texas-school-shooting-focus-mental.htm","resolvedPageUrl":""}},

Paxton defeated George P. Bush, the state land commissioner and a son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, to win nomination to a third term as AG.</p>\n<p>Bush and other seeming heavy hitters were drawn to the March GOP primary because of Paxton&rsquo;s apparent vulnerability. Paxton was indicted, <a data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/texas/ken-paxton-trial/285-679c65b1-b52c-4284-af76-5f78d729d8e0\">years ago now</a>, for securities fraud. Since then, he&rsquo;s come <a data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/paxton-bush-primary-runoff.html\">under FBI investigation</a>, had <a data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/28/texas-ken-paxton-whistleblowers/\">several members of his own staff</a> accuse him of using the office for criminal wrongdoing and is being <a data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/06/ken-paxton-attorney-general-state-bar-election/\">sued by the state bar</a> for his lawsuit, dismissed by the Supreme Court, seeking to block 2020 presidential election results in four other states.</p>\n<p>The whiff of scandal doesn&rsquo;t seem to have hurt him politically. He took 68 percent of the vote against Bush. Republicans seem happy with his performance, notably his habit of repeatedly suing the Biden administration. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t care as long as he&rsquo;s fighting the fight,&rdquo; Chris Byrd, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee, told the <i><a data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/18/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-scandal-supporters/\">Texas Tribune</a></i> last week. &ldquo;Like him or not, Ken Paxton has exhibited more courage in fighting evil than any attorney general we&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Naturally, Paxton denies any wrongdoing. But the playbook for Republican politicians caught in scandals is pretty well-established at this point. What worked for former President Donald Trump is being tried by many others: Blame your enemies, including the liberal media.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the tack taken by Scott Pruitt, who resigned as Trump&rsquo;s EPA head amid scandal in 2018. &ldquo;I had enemies,&rdquo; Pruitt says in an ad for his Oklahoma Senate campaign. &ldquo;<i>The New York Times</i>. <i>The Washington Post</i>. They think they canceled me, but guess what? I'm back.&rdquo; Missouri GOP Senate candidate Eric Greitens, who resigned as governor in 2018 amid scandal and has since been accused of domestic abuse, is taking the same line. Former football star Herschel Walker was able to brush aside stories about domestic abuse and his business and charitable failures in winning the GOP nomination for Senate from Georgia Tuesday.</p>\n<p>It's not foolproof. It didn&rsquo;t work for Charles Herbster, Trump&rsquo;s favored candidate for Nebraska governor, who lost the GOP primary two weeks ago following multiple accusations of sexual harassment. But candidates are no longer shamed by accusations that, a generation or even a decade ago, might have led earlier politicians to drop out.</p>\n<p>Tina Peters, the county clerk and recorder in Mesa County, Colo., was <a data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/03/09/1085452644/colorado-clerk-indicted-on-13-counts-of-election-tampering-and-misconduct\">indicted in March</a> for election tampering.

On Monday, the Arizona Senate voted to investigate one of its members, Wendy Rogers, for claiming the recent mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., was a federal &ldquo;false flag&rdquo; operation. Majority Republicans refused a Democratic plea to expel her, however. Rogers, a 2020 election denialist, has a long history of making outrageous statements.

It found a 19th-century law that allowed former Confederates to run for federal office does not offer blanket amnesty to current politicians who have violated the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s ban on insurrectionists.</p>\n<p>The opinion doesn&rsquo;t spell out how exactly to spot an insurrectionist, though. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently was on trial to determine whether her role in the Jan. 6 coup attempt disqualifies her from serving in Congress, won nomination to a second term in Tuesday&rsquo;s Georgia primaries.</p>\n<p>Constitutional questions are one thing, but not doing your paperwork correctly is something else altogether. Nearly 70,000 candidate qualifying signatures were forged by canvassers, the <a data-cms-ai=\"0\" href=\"https://michiganadvance.com/2022/05/24/massive-signature-fraud-scandal-upends-michigan-gop-gubernatorial-race/\">Michigan Board of State Canvassers</a> announced on Monday.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who has been a special target of attack for Trump, easily defeated former Sen. David Perdue on Tuesday, taking 74 percent of the GOP primary vote. Kemp now faces a rematch against Democrat Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator.</p>\n<p>Alabama GOP Gov. Kay Ivey also easily defeated two primary challengers on Tuesday. She&rsquo;ll be an overwhelming favorite in the fall, as will Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas. Sanders, Trump&rsquo;s former press secretary and a daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, cleared the field when she came home to run and officially won the GOP nomination on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a little rougher for state legislators. Most win, of course, but several have suffered defeat in recent weeks in states such as Idaho and Kentucky, including some committee chairs. In Arkansas, a half-dozen state senators either lost or were forced into runoffs in primaries Tuesday. A couple of incumbents also lost their seats in both Georgia and Alabama. Mike Jones, who chairs the Alabama House Rules Committee, was defeated in a primary for a state Senate seat.</p>\n<ul data-list-loadmore-items=\"\"> <li>  <a data-cms-ai=\"0\"

Sign up here.\nHow to Brush Aside Scandal: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton may have stamped out the last embers of the Bush political dynasty on Tuesday. Paxton defeated George P. Bush, the state land commissioner and a son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, to win nomination to a third term as AG.\nBush and other seeming heavy hitters were drawn to the March GOP primary because of Paxtonâ€™s apparent vulnerability. Paxton was indicted, years ago now, for securities fraud. Since then, heâ€™s come under FBI investigation, had several members of his own staff accuse him of using the office for criminal wrongdoing and is being sued by the state bar for his lawsuit, dismissed by the Supreme Court, seeking to block 2020 presidential election results in four other states.\nThe whiff of scandal doesnâ€™t seem to have hurt him politically. He took 68 percent of the vote against Bush. Republicans seem happy with his performance, notably his habit of repeatedly suing the Biden administration. â€œI really donâ€™t care as long as heâ€™s fighting the fight,â€� Chris Byrd, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee, told the Texas Tribune last week. â€œLike him or not, Ken Paxton has exhibited more courage in fighting evil than any attorney general weâ€™ve had.â€�\nNaturally, Paxton denies any wrongdoing. But the playbook for Republican politicians caught in scandals is pretty well-established at this point. What worked for former President Donald Trump is being tried by many others: Blame your enemies, including the liberal media.\nThatâ€™s the tack taken by Scott Pruitt, who resigned as Trumpâ€™s EPA head amid scandal in 2018. â€œI had enemies,â€� Pruitt says in an ad for his Oklahoma Senate campaign. â€œThe New York Times. The Washington Post. They think they canceled me, but guess what? I'm back.â€� Missouri GOP Senate candidate Eric Greitens, who resigned as governor in 2018 amid scandal and has since been accused of domestic abuse, is taking the same line. Former football star Herschel Walker was able to brush aside stories about domestic abuse and his business and charitable failures in winning the GOP nomination for Senate from Georgia Tuesday.\nIt's not foolproof. It didnâ€™t work for Charles Herbster, Trumpâ€™s favored candidate for Nebraska governor, who lost the GOP primary two weeks ago following multiple accusations of sexual harassment. But candidates are no longer shamed by accusations that, a generation or even a decade ago, might have led earlier politicians to drop out.\nTina Peters, the county clerk and recorder in Mesa County, Colo., was indicted in March for election tampering. Last week, she smiled for her arrest photo and pledged sheâ€™ll keep on running for secretary of state. On Monday, the Arizona Senate voted to investigate one of its members, Wendy Rogers, for claiming the recent mass shooting in Buffalo, N.Y., was a federal â€œfalse flagâ€� operation. Majority Republicans refused a Democratic plea to expel her, however. Rogers, a 2020 election denialist, has a long history of making outrageous statements. Rather than hurt her, this has helped her raise $4 million over the past couple of years â€“ huge money for a state legislator.\nIn todayâ€™s polarized politics, the enemy of your enemies still seems to be your friend, almost regardless of how much trouble that friend may get into.\nWhat Is Disqualifying?: The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that maybe there is such a thing as going too far. It found a 19th-century law that allowed former Confederates to run for federal office does not offer blanket amnesty to current politicians who have violated the 14th Amendmentâ€™s ban on insurrectionists.\nThe opinion doesnâ€™t spell out how exactly to spot an insurrectionist, though. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently was on trial to determine whether her role in the Jan. 6 coup attempt disqualifies her from serving in Congress, won nomination to a second term in Tuesdayâ€™s Georgia primaries.\nConstitutional questions are one thing, but not doing your paperwork correctly is something else altogether. Nearly 70,000 candidate qualifying signatures were forged by canvassers, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers announced on Monday. This means five out of 10 expected GOP candidates for governor, including two of the top contenders, wonâ€™t appear on the August primary ballot.\nItâ€™s an enormous break for Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, generally considered among the nationâ€™s most vulnerable governors this year.\nItâ€™s Hard to Beat Incumbents: No fewer than 15 Republican governors seeking re-election this year are facing or have faced primary challenges, but so far theyâ€™re all doing fine. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who has been a special target of attack for Trump, easily defeated former Sen. David Perdue on Tuesday, taking 74 percent of the GOP primary vote. Kemp now faces a rematch against Democrat Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator.\nAlabama GOP Gov. Kay Ivey also easily defeated two primary challengers on Tuesday. Sheâ€™ll be an overwhelming favorite in the fall, as will Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas. Sanders, Trumpâ€™s former press secretary and a daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, cleared the field when she came home to run and officially won the GOP nomination on Tuesday.\nItâ€™s been a little rougher for state legislators. Most win, of course, but several have suffered defeat in recent weeks in states such as Idaho and Kentucky, including some committee chairs. In Arkansas, a half-dozen state senators either lost or were forced into runoffs in primaries Tuesday. A couple of incumbents also lost their seats in both Georgia and Alabama. Mike Jones, who chairs the Alabama House Rules Committee, was defeated in a primary for a state Senate seat.","summary":"Editor's Note: this article is a part of Governing's Inside Politics newsletter.
